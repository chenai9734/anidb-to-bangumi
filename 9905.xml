<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="470321">reminds me of Sekirei..lots of beautiful girls/battleships but with an awesome plot and war battles..one of my fav this season</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="130855">there is a new concept in this anime. don`t let the rating fool you it worth watching it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="506415">The show was very enjoyable overall in my opinion. Quite enjoyable character progression and plot. The last episode felt a bit rushed but everything else was good.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="161064">I really enjoyed this anime. CGI was actually to my liking. I think it gave a smooth, consistent performance throughout the series. Characters were likeable. Story was kept to the minimum and i think it was the right decision. A little journey with simple yet meaningful drama, little bit of comedy and fan service here and there, and, of-course, lots of action and explosion to keep things lively! If you can go past the premise of moe battleship girls, stop trying to find reason for every detail or looking for flaws and enjoy it as a whole you will find this a well put together show. 7.5/10</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="152661">I cant express how much I really enjoyed this series, totally devastated that is all come to an end, it just started to feel like the whole story was picking up as well. at least now i can focus on the manga! Ignore the ratings.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="38418">I don`t know what`s wrong with the rating.... but this one it`s one of the best anime of fall season!!! Battle scenes are incredible!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="560966">If you enjoy WWII-style naval combat, mixed with sci-fi, modernized weapons and lasers, and cute girls, you`ll probably enjoy this.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="515975">Really good.  The Fog are an interesting foe, and the girls as ships genre is a lot of fun.

The plot is good, as are the characters.  Although there`s some some seemingly random fan service thrown in, it`s still definitely worth a watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="304100">somewhat fan service-y, but the plot is very interesting. The characters are also creative. An underdog series.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="94249">A different approach, but a definite breath of fresh air. The animation is different from what you normally would be accustomed to, but you can easily get used to it. 

The story is well told, the characters grow, and the fights are just awesome.

Like everyone says, don`t listen to the ratings and watch for yourself. This is the definite underdog this season, and is given much too few credit than what it deserves.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="139484">Unusual CG animation, but its easy to get used to it, plus its really a nice one. Dont let the rating fool you, this anime is a must see one. One of the best in this season.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="116115">Be warned, the anime turns out to be a lot different from the manga, that is the main reason for the low rating: haters gonna hate. Nevertheless, the show is very good taken on its own, it`s much more than a pew pew anime, and some things are handled even better than in the manga (inho).
Don`t be fooled by the usual "know it all" bad review guy, don`t pass on this one.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="495005">This show in terms of Characterization and art have taken many risks but the execution was superb! I greatly enjoyed this series over the time I watched the simulcast and I will re-watch it again. It really was a pleasure aboard this show and with it`s crew! However one think irks me about this show... It`s for never saying "You sunk my battleship"</recommendation>

<description>A fleet of unmanned ships, called the http://anidb.net/ch56444 [Fleet of Fog], equipped with super advanced weapons and technology suddenly appeared all over the world. Mankind didn`t have the capability to face such a fleet and so was defeated in a devastating naval war. This resulted in mankind being driven out of the seas and losing their ability to travel the seas. Years after this devastating naval war, http://anidb.net/ch56439 [Chihaya Gunzou] and his friends are aboard the http://anidb.net/ch59269 [I-401], a former Fleet of Fog submarine. Together with the I-401`s mental model, http://anidb.net/ch56440 [Iona], they take on the Fleet of Fog.</description>

<name>military</name>
<description>The military, also known as the armed forces, are forces authorized and legally entitled to use deadly force so as to support the interests of the state and its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its citizens and the prosecution of war against foreign powers. The military may also have additional functions within a society, including construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding critical areas.

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometers, about 30% of Earth`s total land area and 8.7% of the Earth`s total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<description>The conspiracy thriller (or paranoid thriller) is a sub-genre of the thriller which flourished in the 1970s in the US (and was echoed in other parts of the world) in the wake of a number of high-profile scandals and controversies (most notably Vietnam, the assassination of President Kennedy, Chappaquiddick and Watergate), and which exposed what many people regarded as the clandestine machinations and conspiracies beneath the orderly fabric of political life.
The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top".</description>

The level of modification will vary from subtle changes in "look" (e.g. super-human beauty), to mental enhancements (PSI powers), to more or less atrocious adaptations to extreme environments (breath under water, radiation resistance). Note that changes in Aliens would be difficult to pinpoint, after all they are alien.</description>

<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<description>Cel shading (often misspelled as `cell shading`) or toon shading is a type of non-photorealistic rendering designed to make 3-D computer graphics appear to be flat. Cel-shading is often used to mimic the style of a comic book or cartoon. It is somewhat recent, appearing from around the beginning of the twenty-first century. The name comes from cels (short for celluloid), the clear sheets of acetate which are painted on for use in traditional 2D animation.</description>

<description>Computer-generated imagery (CGI) or computer animation is the art of creating moving images via the use of computers. It is a subfield of computer graphics and animation. Increasingly it is created by means of 3D computer graphics, though 2D computer graphics are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time rendering needs. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another medium, such as film.</description>

More so than the power of friendship, the power of true love gives boundless strength and resolution; by the power of love every hardship can be overcome, every issue can be resolved and it does make people resistant to food poisoning (caused by the bad cooking of their loved ones). Even the big bad evil doesn`t stand a chance against the power of true love and often ends up redeemed.
Even when the power of love is not literally and directly responsible, the scene is often set so that the audience is left with the impression that it was "really responsible".</description>

<name>3D CG animation</name>
<description>Abbreviation for "three-dimensional computer generated animation" or "computer graphics" (CGI). The traditional 2D art is enhanced by 3D imagery developed through computer modeling software. Done in the right way, this union of 3D in a 2D animated world can be a very beautiful relationship.
The difference lies in what lacks the traditional 2D animation all together and may give term to something produced entirely with 3D graphics (such as the 2006 remake of "Appleseed" , 2007`s "Vexille", the 2008 addition to the "Biohazard" series and the more well known "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within" and "Advent Children").</description>
