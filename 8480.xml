<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="479958">One word... EPIC</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="274870">Standard issue shounen anime with highs and lows.  Should have been half as along, as the second half dragged a bit with the whole high school dystopia subplot.  Still, lots of action, tragic and triumphant moments, and a likeable cast of characters.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="127475">Started off amazing. Great animation, great music, great characters, interesting story, though nothing new. Went off downhill in the second half. Quality wise it was still good, but betrayed the expectation that it gives in the first half. Good to watch when you have time, but don`t expect too much, even halfway through the anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="517318">I`m going to speak a bit from what I`ve seen in this. I love the colors and the Animation. Production I.G. has another winner on its team!! While others may compare it to other type of Animated episodes or such, you`ve got to understand that most of the REAL Anime is just making a comeback. I can remember in the early 1990`s of the SLUMP that had occurred even as I was collecting what I thought was "GooD" Anime. Man, was I wrong!!! After watching THIS series, I am safe to say that Guilty Crown`s flashy music and wonderfully-detailed transformation scenes is nothing short of fantastic. It`s nice to have something different versus watching episoe 353 of Bleach. GOOD Job I.G.!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="42005">I am sorry to say but this is just for fans imho. I personally just...didn`t like the show. 
Animation: Great
Music: Ok...I guess (but no Yoko Kano)
Character design: pretty good (although I could have gone without the jiggling boobies; also, there was not one fanserice moment for girls...even Evangelion had Kaworu and Code Geass had Lelouche)
Character development: very erratic, sometimes stiff
Story line: bullshit...sometimes too fast/too slow/too unlogical</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="498834">The first half was amazing then it went all down hill after that but the animation/CG is top notch the BGM is awesome so were the voids. This is one of those turn your brain off and enjoy the sound and visuals</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="413167">This show looks gorgeous and has amazing soundtrack but it`s plot is a mess, it has HORRIBLY OUT OF PLACE fan service and wish fulfillment for example the main weapon (I say weapon because you must have more personality then rei ayami, who they combined with annthy form utena in order to be a character).  singing "So Everything that makes me whole, I`ll give it to you, I`m yours". maybe this would not be SO BAD if the animation and music was not so amazing, or that it was on noitamina. I am now scared for the noitamina block and if it will be staying around.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="384847">Nice music, nice animation in the first half, horrid writing that also keeps characters bouncing around with next to no consistency.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="481845">I quite agree with marduk. This anime is just concentrating on the animation and they make a really boring and stupid story. It`s kinda like Shining Tear x Wind with the Soul Blade stuff... @@!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="294957">At first I was very impressed with the first episode.  Then a few episodes later, I just couldn`t bear to watch it anymore.  The plot became completely uninteresting and the main character just can`t figure out how to man the hell up.  Extremely irritating imo.  The show DOES have amazing animation, and great music so if you can ignore the flaws, then you`ll probably enjoy this.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="210496">Animation, design, and music are wonderful. Otherwise, plot, character, development, and everything else fall short of bearable. Recommended for shounen genre fans that don`t care about the "deeper" stuff.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="233389">It`s soooo stupid.... but the animation and music is awesome. Throw away your brain and you could enjoy this.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="429261">One of the anime that really showed promising potential to turn into an epic adventure,but, unfortunately the only thing it managed was to destroy it, horrible development,ridiculous cheesy battles and nonsensical  plot. 
The art was good along with some nice music, but the way anime tried to mix Evangelion with Code Geass and TTGL pretty much ruined  anything unique you could expect from it. A huge disappointment even if it started amazing in first 2 episodes.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="477606">If not for ending, It`ll be a great series.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="555526">The animation and soundtrack was really good and nice to watch. The protagonist was soooo annoying...this piece of **** made the whole show unwatchable. However, when you have nothing to do, you can try to watch this one.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="472569">The story is another "lets team up against the bad people" thing , but i like the way the characters are. the color and background music is so good, and characters are likable (all except the 2 main chars..seriously)...but dot get ur hopes up, cuz ur not going to be treated with a good story</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="444607">This started of as a great watch for me, but towards the end at about episode 16-17 it kept getting worse and worse for me. If you`re a fan of this ``code geass`` genre then by all means go for it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="129591">Little Code geass, little elfen lied, little d-gray man total ramen with everything inside it. It must be finished after 12-13 episode but interestingly it keeps going?!? Action anime to just pass time not worth to watch it if u dont fan of this genre.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="404868">It has been quite a long time I`ve watched and really enjoyed an shounen anime like this. Sure it`s a little cheesy, it`s an shounen anime, after all. But the character reactions and emotion are good. Pure Inory, Gai is one hell of a son of gun, Segai have and excellent sense of humor (though a little twisted lol ). The animation is so so plus  but the art is good. Music`s good.  Actions ain`t an impressive but at least, they`re fast. The main char`s a pussy and constantly bump into mistakes after mistakes may pissing a lot of people off (try to keep patient, `kay ). In Conclusion this anime a hard_to_swallow_but_sweeten_to_the_end  candy. Should watch if you do not hate shounen anime too much</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="284604">Started out good with lots of action and possibilities and then seemed to go down from there, the ending was decent but was not nearly as enwrapping as when it started out. The main character changes throughout the story starting out innocent, becoming jaded and then refocusing. Action, Mecha, Post Apocalyptic, End of the World, Super Powers, Death of Characters.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="244372">Watched up to ep 13, its not masterpiece, but rather entertaining anime in genre with really good song/animation. If anything doesnt make me bored, its not an easy task to archive.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="522144">Leave aside the soundtracks, you`ll find it nicely to watch, but not as far as masterpiece...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="522093">Pretty good, I enjoyed it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="389212">Pluses (+) Music, character`s emotional reactions, MC`s character growth
Minuses (-) Most of the protagonists` and antagonists`, characters and groups, goals and motivations are unknown, or not clearly explained, for most of the series. Leading to most of the anime being meaningless action, due to lack of context, making it hard to be engaged in story.
Overall: Slightly above average dramatic shounen that ends well</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="214456">Very poor imitation of Code Geass, the same scenes, sometimes even the similar words spoken by characters. Music is a bit better than the plot. Watch only if you`re super bored.

edit 15.02.2012:
getting slightly better from episode 12, but still getting 95% of scenes from Geass</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="520538">A very beautifully anime to watch. The animation, color, and fight scenes are fantastic. Starts off great, but is slowed down for character development. A must see for shounen fans with a hint of mecha.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="452040">This series seem to have MUCH unwarranted hate.

1st off, you can`t really expect all shounen to be the next Death Note or whatever. Cut this series some slack and appreciate it for what it is: a visual and auditory treat with little plot to think about.

--edit--

just rewatched the first five episodes. the plot is not told word for word, watch out for hints outside of the character`s dialogue. it`s that kind of show.

2nd, It has memorable characters. though it`s mostly because everyone remembers the stripper. but regardless, the cast is pretty good, even if they are rather a stereotypical bunch.

3rd, noitaminA. --edit-- and Production I.G.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="269300">Luv`d it, &amp;lt;_&amp;lt;
Watch it until the end to be satisfied.
Touching moments, admirable chars, lovely ending!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="534909">Deep story, fantastic characters and lots of action! This made me watch anime again!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="248649">I watched the whole serie and I think It`s worth be watched. It`s not a masterpiece but it`s a good anime with a story, badass charas and prolly the best soundtrack of the season.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="527292">I have to say watch this show with an open mind its stunning and sounds amazing the story is a lil confusing i agree but if you follow along you will get it and find its actually a very wel thought out anime and is a definite watch for me... has alot of interesting abilities and roles.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="182776">The shows starts slow, and the main character is annoying, but once you kick past the first half it becomes a completely different anime (into something that actually is really good), its nearly like a completely different writer took over. The characters are more shades of grey than black or white, and the plot keeps taking turns every episode (but not in a bad way). PLS don`t hate before you`ve really given it a try. It is DEFINITELY worth sitting through this one!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="193384">I`ve just finished watching this and thought it`s good. With all the hate out there, I doubt there would be many people giving this a chance. But if you don`t care about reviews and ratings and all the hate, or just want to find some new anime to try out, give this a go. I think it`s not an exceptional or deep-moving anime, but it`s worth a try. I love it though. The character design is super awesome.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="718874">This show is a hidden gem. The story was amazing, as it included almost all aspects of different types of anime (action, mecha, fantasy, school, romance, etc;) and it has a unique plot that left me interested, and I always found that I was willing to watch *just one more* episode at any time of day. The story is not all happy either, as there is major loss, and plot twists that one would never expect. The music was also incredible, and it`s a real shame that the show never got a season 2.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="728642">I have to say there are a to of good points. The animation is amazing, the story has a lot of potential, soundtrack is awesome. Personally, the characters could have been a bit more lovable, I was confused by some of the story and (for me) it didn`t start getting good until ep 11. Glad I watched it though but wasn`t as good as it had the potential to be. Watch it and see what you think :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="622708">Starts lousy, but suddenly midway through it gets excellent, to the extent that you appreciate the lousy beginning as it`s part of the charm.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="304100">This is one of my favorites so far this season. Definitely in my top five. I`ve heard people call it a "typical shounen." But don`t let that put you off. The music and visuals are some the best you`ll get this season.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="384527">Above average on the first half, but absolutely incredible on the second.
All through, great animation and soundtrack.

Plot probably not original (did not see Code Geass to say to what extent), but definitely not equal to any other anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="471611">Hmm this is a grate action,heart warming story sometime you might get the feeling to drop this but don`t at the end you are gonna cry it is just soo that much good trust me, i wish this didn`t end, just watch it you will understand why</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="221253">Great animation and epic soundtrack, not much more to say about that.
The plot is extremely suppressed because of so few episodes, but if you keep your focus, then you`ll find an original idea and another great "from zero to hero" story!
Some shounen romance elements as well.
I don`t usually give a Must See, but this really is an underrated work of art.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="231428">I see so much hate on this anime and i can sorta agree BUT! you cannot judge this series off of the first couple episodes. It has a slow start but at the moment it is in my opinion the best anime that has come out this year</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="386879">This is the one of the best anime I have seen this type.
First 5-6 episodes I were bored a bit but after sixth episode started the fun.
Music also I liked much!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="486670">must see anime! This anime has superb action and great story line. As u reach the end of the story u may realize that it has some plot holes but this doesn`t need to bother you at all, cause in every episode it keeps the intense high and lets you enjoy it! Plus it has great romance, Inori is really awesome and unique character!!! much of a drama!! and i `ll say it even the music is great!!!!!!!!!!</recommendation>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>absurdist humour</name>
<description>Surreal humour, also known as absurdist humour, is a form of humour predicated on deliberate violations of causal reasoning, producing events and behaviours that are obviously illogical. Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, non-sequiturs, irrational or absurd situations, and expressions of nonsense.
The humour arises from a subversion of audience`s expectations, so that amusement is founded on unpredictability, separate from a logical analysis of the situation. Its appeal stems from the fact that the situation described is exceedingly ridiculous or unlikely.
On an analytical level, all jokes contain a certain amount of incongruity, but while regular jokes carry an incongruity that the audience accepts as compatible with expectations, absurd jokes are characterized by a disproportionate amount of it, with the punch line delivering a situation incompatible with the world as we know it and failing to resolve the matter in the audience`s eyes.

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<description>A dystopia (from Ancient Greek: δυσ-, "bad, ill", and Ancient Greek: τόπος, "place, landscape"; alternatively cacotopia, or anti-utopia) is, in literature, an often futuristic society that has degraded into a repressive and controlled state, often under the guise of being utopian. Dystopian literature has underlying cautionary tones, warning society that if we continue to live how we do, this will be the consequence. A dystopia, thus, is regarded as a sort of negative utopia and is often characterized by an authoritarian or totalitarian form of government. Dystopias usually feature different kinds of repressive social control systems, a lack or total absence of individual freedoms and expressions and constant states of warfare or violence. Dystopias often explore the concept of humans abusing technology and how humans individually and collectively cope with technology that has evolved too quickly such as the car, the flamethrower or the microwave. A dystopian society is also often characterized by widespread poverty and brutal political controls such as a large military-like police.</description>

<description>An anime that takes place on future Earth (or it could be an alternative universe) after a major cataclysm has occurred.

The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologised). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in an agrarian, non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of technology remain. There is a considerable degree of blurring between post-apocalyptic fiction and that which deals with false utopias or dystopian societies.</description>

<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<name>noitaminA</name>
<description>noitaminA (ノイタミナ) – Animation written backwards – is a Fuji Television programming block, devoted to anime, broadcast each Thursday night from 00:45 to 1:15. It was launched with the intention of expanding the target audience beyond the typical young male demographic.
The timeslot was expanded from half an hour to a full hour in 2010, and now airs Thursday nights from 00:45 to 1:45.
noitaminA aired its first non-anime series in 2010, with the premiere of the live-action adaptation of Moyashimon. On April 15, 2010, Fuji TV and FUNimation announced an agreement that allows FUNimation to simulcast series from the noitaminA block in North America within an hour of their airing in Japan.</description>

<name>improbable physics</name>
<description>The physics in this anime have little to do with real-world physics, and are actually very much exaggerated.
Examples: Cars hitting a tiny obstacle, but then flying through the air for no apparent reason, or flimsy bullets slamming heavy characters clear across the room.</description>

<name>rebellion</name>
<description>Rebellion, uprising, or insurrection is a refusal of obedience or order. It may, therefore, be seen as encompassing a range of behaviors aimed at destroying or taking over the position of an established authority such as a government, governor, president, political leader, financial institution, or person in charge. On the one hand the forms of behaviour can include non-violent methods such as the (overlapping but not quite identical) phenomena of civil disobedience, civil resistance and nonviolent resistance. On the other hand it may encompass violent campaigns. Those who participate in rebellions, especially if they are armed rebellions, are known as "rebels".&#13;

<name>paradise lost</name>
<description>Derived from the Biblical story of the Fall of Man: the temptation of Adam and Eve by the fallen angel Satan and their expulsion from the Garden of Eden.
This tag is used to demonstrate the unbearable loss, the feeling of losing everything along with every single bit of happiness. It prerequisites a small peaceful period of happiness. The main reason for losing "his/her paradise" can either be the death/sacrifice of an important character or even a betrayal. Usually the anime loses a lot of its former glory afterwards.</description>

<name>antihero</name>
<description>An antihero is a main character in a story who lacks conventional heroic qualities and attributes such as idealism, courage and morality. Although antiheroes may sometimes perform actions that are morally correct, it is not always for the right reasons, often acting primarily out of self-interest or in ways that defy conventional ethical codes.
A villain protagonist is where the leading character of the story (the protagonist) is also a villain; this is a fairly rare occurrence.</description>

<description>There is a male character in this anime that is overall not very manly. Most of the time he starts off as your typical high school student. In time there are, through major changes in his life, several more characteristics added to his personality. Usually these add up to be extremely pathetic and the character becomes quite annoying. This goes along with the viewers wish for him to get over it and do something about it. Hence, he should "Man the hell up!".</description>

<name>deus ex machina</name>
<description>When the story has been spun so wildly and the plot has been driven so deeply, when all resources are exhausted and the linear truth stands so proudly at the end of the road, ready to bring the never-ending adventure to its epic conclusion...
The writers kick you in the behind and say "Screw that!! Suddenly... UFOs!!! No, wait, Werewolf UFOs!!! Bet you didn`t see that coming!"
It`s the old-Greek form of solving your broken story because it was too much work to do it all over again, or you`ve already shown stuff that compromises what you wanted to do. It`s finding out about a better dragon on a whole different planet because you`ve already been revived 3 times and that`s the cap. It`s breaking a spaceship and "oh wait, there`s an exact copy built in secret by an unknown guy on the other side of the planet, and you can use it free of charge". It`s Doraemon`s pouch, on every single episode.</description>

<name>beach visit</name>
<description>Every anime has to have them, episodes in which the characters for whatever reason end up going to the sea, ocean, random island or the local pond.
Usually used for fanservice purpose as it gives the staff the opportunity to draw the characters in swimsuits and raise the DVD sales.
The cheap version is the http://anidb.net/t6046 [pool episode].
Other marginally less used variants of this are the http://anidb.net/t3444 [onsen episode] and the http://anidb.net/t2830 [furo scene], used when it is too cold for a beach/pool episode.

"TAMAHOMEEEE!!" "MIAKAAAA!!"
Feelings of any kind towards other characters are best shown by calling each other`s name, loud, REALLY LOUD. For better effect at least twice or thrice. For lover`s couples and mortal enemies it is a requirement to run towards each other while calling each other`s name, unaware of the surroundings.</description>

<name>just as planned</name>
<description>A term usually used to describe a situation, where a seemingly smart and cunning villain sets up a plan that seems grand and impressive, but is actually long winding, ridiculous, and convoluted. And all of that just to trick his opponent(s), like the hero or anybody else, into doing things exactly as he planned. Suffice to say that the villain could have reached his goal by much shorter and easier means, it just wouldn`t seem as awesome anymore.
The phrase is also known as the original Japanese "keikaku doori" where keikaku stands translated for "plan" or "schedule", and doori for "in accordance with ..." or "following ...".
The phrase is a reference to http://anidb.net/ch301 [Yagami Light] from http://anidb.net/a4563 [Death Note], and his love for plans.</description>

Her death hurt him the most which drove him over the edge to the point of losing some of his sanity. He was treating friends and enemies in the same way till the school rebellion which led to his common sense coming back.</description>

<summary>Shu is arrested by the GHQ much to his classmates shock and worry. He is sent to GHQ Isolation Facility Four where he remains silent about the Undertakers. Upon learning Gai and the Undertakers will attack the Facility to rescue their "comrade", Major Segai brings Shu to the Isolation ward, revealing Yahiro sold him out so his brother, a victim of the Apocalypse Virus, can get treatment. Furthermore, Major Segai justifies GHQ`s harsher actions for the safety of Japan and uses Shu`s feelings for Inori and his doubts about Gai. He reveals that the "comrade" Gai wants to rescue is mass murderer Kenji Kido, which makes Shu question Gai`s trustworthiness. The Major gives Shu a transmitter disguised as a pen that he is to use if he comes in contact with Gai. Later that night, a disguised Gai visits Shu and tells him his plans to rescue Kenji, however, Shu doesn`t want to be involved. Tsugumi informs the two that Inori has disobeyed Gai`s orders to stand by in order to rescue Shu. Shu, worried, goes to save her, forcing Gai to change his plan. Protected by Ayase`s Endlave Steiner, Shu heads to where Inori is at until he encounters Kenji himself and uses his Void, a Gravity gun to stop the GHQ Endlaves and rescue Inori. After Isolation Facility`s destruction, Gai offers Shu to follow him. Shu reluctantly agrees, however, he keeps the transmitter given to him and does not inform Gai of his exchange with the Major.

<summary>Shu is still shocked that not only has Inori transferred to his school but is living at his home as well. Gai reveals to Shu that he sent Inori to protect him because a student at his school who is secretly a drug dealer nicknamed Sugar saw him during the Undertakers battle with the GHQ at Roppongi and confirms Shu`s suspicions that Gai can see other people`s Voids. Because Gai only recognize Sugar`s Void as pair of large shears, Shu has to confront his fellow classmates one by one and take out their Voids to confirm their identities. After several failures and escaping the wrath of class representative Kanon Kusama, Shu soon figures out Sugar is actually his friend Yahiro Samugawa, after figuring out Yahiro knows a lot of things he shouldn`t know and his taste of horror films. His identity exposed, Yahiro angrily shows his true self before Shu subdues him by pulling out his Void. Inori tries to kill Yahiro but Shu stops her as Yahiro is still his friend where both he and Yahiro resolve their difference and not reveal each other secrets. But the next day, Yahiro betrays Shu by selling him out to the GHQ led by Major Makoto Waltz Segai.

<summary>Gai survives the attack but reveals that his team and the mercenaries were killed by the Leukocyte blast. At the outskirts of Tsukigase Dam, Gai briefs the Undertakers that their mission is to attack the Dam where the Leukocyte control system is located but due to the Leukocyte`s security system, he will have Shu use Kenji`s Void to disable it. Shu doesn`t want to take part of the operation as he`s afraid of the people who will die if he fails until Inori goes to talk to him. Meanwhile at Tsukigase Dam, Major Segai informs the Anti Bodies director Shuichiro Keido that his men are prepared for the Undertakers attack including Daryl, who wants revenge against the Undertakers for stealing his Steiner. As Gai gets another blood transfusion in a room alone, he confesses to what he assumes is Inori that he regrets of the lives who died for him and it was difficult to act as their fearless leader until he realizes the other person was in fact Shu due to Inori. Shu admits he never wanted to see this side of Gai and agrees to join the operation. As the Undertakers distract the GHQ forces guarding the dam, Shu, Gai, and Kenji sneak into the Leukocyte control system with Inori defending them. As Gai and Shu hacks the control system with Tsugumi`s help via Funell, Segai sends Daryl to stop them which Gai battles and disables Daryl`s Endlave. However, Daryl damages the control system, sending one of the Leukocyte`s crashing to the dam. In order to stop it, Gai makes a deal with Segai that he will stop the crashing satellite using Shu`s transmitter, revealing it is actually a targeting beacon for the Leukocytes, in exchange that he destroys all records of Shu`s involvement with the Undertakers. Realizing Gai is sacrificing himself to destroy the falling satellite, Shu, with Inori`s encouragement, combines Kenji`s and Inori`s Voids to destroy not only the falling satellite but also the one still in space. With the operation over, Shu finally accepts Gai and the Undertakers while Shuichiro speaks with a mysterious blond youngster over "Cocytus awakening".

<summary>Shu arrives at the Undertakers Headquarters at Roppongi Fort where Gai introduces him to the Undertakers and plans to hold a trial for Shu before he can officially join them. Gai assigns Ayase as Shu`s instructor while he leads a mission to take over "Leukocyte". Ayase dislikes Shu but is only training him because it was Gai`s orders and Shu has to pass the trial as Ayase has his pen, unaware it`s a transmitter but she will only give it back after passing the trial. After some hard training, Shu encounters Inori, telling her that he joined the Undertakers because of her and asks her if she will join him if he wanted to leave the Undertakers. But Inori tells him she won`t because Gai gave her a life and purpose and claims Gai told her to use his feelings for her to join Undertakers before entering Gai`s room. Dejected, Shu runs away and bumps into Ayase, who consoles Shu and gives him some encouragement for tomorrow`s trial. Unknown to both of them, despite what it seems, Inori is actually giving Gai a blood transfusion. On the day of trial, Shu has a mock battle with Ayase`s Steiner where if he gets past Steiner and into the vehicle behind it, he will pass the trial. Shu succeeds the task after using Arugo`s Void to blind Steiner and get into the vehicle where Ayase and the Undertakers congratulate Shu of the becoming one of them. Just as Kenji arrives, the Undertakers receives a troubling report from Tsugumi. Gai earlier led a team to intercept the arrival of mercenaries and Endlaves at an airport but their position was shoot by Leukocyte, an orbital satellite laser.
