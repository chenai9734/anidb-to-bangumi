<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="354513">it has basically 3 parts

first: SAO with guns
second: generic carefree ALO questing
third: made me cry like a little girl.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="560633">If you love cliffhanges and I mean love! This is the show for you my friend. ;)

I think this is a very good show and I recommend it.
Well atleast they are smart with the cliffhangers. You just Have to see whats going to happen next.  

It`s got great art and the action scenes are very good.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="139011">Good maybe great continuation of the series. Just enough throwbacks to SAO to let you know who the main characters are with out having to watch the original ( which I think is a must see). If they continue with this quality, I`ll put this series in the must see class which I don`t do very often</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="111668">While the overall story isn`t godlike or groundbreaking, it does have a nice feeling to it overall. Three different arcs that cover several aspects. Gun Gale isn`t action packed but the new environment, mystery and suspense did add something new to the series. While ALO just gave it a really nice closing. It felt as they used more than 2-3 episodes to give it a nice and chill ending. As someone who found SAO to be quite boring after 5-6 eps, SAO 2  actually brought me some enjoyment throughout the whole serie in these times where action animes are quite lacklustre.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="435">Definitely weaker than s1. 
The first half deals with murders in a gun mmo instead of medieval fantasy stuff, which brings some fresh air to the show. The second half is more drama-like, but imo well performed.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="623957">Nothing much to say here, almost everything I want to say already been said by other users. So If you like SAO, you probably like this, and if you totally like Kirito action, this would make your day. And if you don`t like Asuna (like me), you`ll cry after watching this.

Gawd, I`m mad that this anime made me cry.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="801030">not better than S1 but to see</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="434710">Must see!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="398648">I don`t care about the manga or the 1st season...
The feelings it transmit, the friendship and the bonds they have, and most important to me, the way that Asuna is happy with others happiness! I can see myself entirely on that way of life and that way of thinking.
Those last 4/5 episodes were the best to me. Asuna gain a special place on my heart now.
Saying that it ended bad, that it was a shame, mediocre or forgettable is like not having feelings at all. it`s impossible!</recommendation>

<description>* Based on http://anidb.net/cr28670 [Kawahara Reki]`s light novel series Sword Art Online.
A year has passed since Sword Art Online (SAO) was cleared. http://anidb.net/ch46771 [Kirito] is asked by http://anidb.net/ch62759 [Kikuoka] to investigate Gun Gale Online, specifically Death Gun, a weapon which seemed to link deaths in the virtual reality world to those in the real world.
Upon entering the game, http://anidb.net/ch62712 [Kirito] meets http://anidb.net/ch62713 [Sinon] who teaches him the ropes of the game. They both enter the Gun Gale Online tournament, Bullet of Bullets. Kirito displays his amazing skills although he is only a newcomer to the game. Later, Kirito finds out that the mysterious deaths are linked to a red guild named Laughing Coffin in SAO.

Note: The first episode received advance premiere screening on June 29, 2014. Regular television broadcast started on July 5.</description>

<name>trap</name>
<description>A trap is a plot device where a male character is mistaken for a female, with the intention of sexually deceiving other characters and/or the viewer. This behavior does not need to be intentional by the male (it is often not intentional) or continually maintained by the male, but the occurrence is common enough to deserve this fetish-specific tag.
This is often achieved by portraying the male character as a female; primarily via their clothing and physical appearance, but also through his behaviour, and/or language. A male character misinterpreted by others as female, without action from the male (explicitly feminine dress or behaviour), is generally not considered a trap; instead they are likely just http://anidb.net/t2561 [androgynous].
The reverse case is known as a http://anidb.net/t1637 [reverse trap].

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>This character sometimes wears clothes traditionally worn by and associated with the opposite sex.
Cross-dressers often hide their cross-dressing identity for a long period of time and thus tend to become adept in accurately portraying the opposite sex in terms of voice, movement, behaviour, temperament, etc.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<tag id="2607" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2009-04-29">
<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

When it is announced that the players of Sword Art Online can no longer logout, he is surprised like everyone else, but unlike everyone else he quickly gets over it and accepts it, to an extent. He mainly uses a one-handed sword and usually wears all black in game, as it adds to stealth. He can also use two blades at once, a unique skill to him and he only uses it in emergencies to avoid attention for being one out of the two people to have unique skills. His game alias is Kirito, which is created by taking the syllables of the first and last Kanji of his real last and first names respectively: (Kirigaya Kazuto). In the real world, he lives with his mother and younger sister in a family of 3.</description>

<description>Originally a side story character in SAO, Yui later becomes an accompanying/support character in ALO. At first thought to be a lost child in SAO, she is actually an artificial intelligence program. Her full designation is «Mental Health - Counselling Program», MHCP version 1, codename, «Yui». She was designed to monitor the emotions of players and appear at their sides to hear and help them out. However, since the moment everyone was imprisoned in Sword Art Online, she was forbidden to come in contact with the players and complete her prime directive. Unable to do anything but suffer as she monitored the emotions of the trapped players, she came upon Kirito and Asuna whose emotions stood out as a beacon of joy and peace in a sea of fear and despair. She sought them out, appearing to them as an amnesia child whom they adopted. In the end she was nearly deleted by Cardinal, the management system of SAO. But Kirito saved her by converting and storing her data into his own Nerve Gear. Yui later shows up in ALO as a Private Navigation Pixie and helps Kirito along with Leafa to find Asuna. She refers to Kirito as "Papa" and Asuna as "Mama" and gets very annoyed if any girl other than Shinon, Leafa or Asuna gets close to Kirito.

<description>The Sleeping Knights was a small guild of players who had tried various virtual reality games. The last game they have tried was New ALfheim Online, where they decided to defeat a Floor Boss and have their names engraved on the Monument of Swordsmen.
In reality, all members of the guild were terminally ill patients who met on a virtual hospice named Serene Garden. Originally, there were nine members in the guild and it was led by Ran, the sister of the second leader Yuuki.
Together, they began traveling through various different virtual worlds and had undergone numerous adventures. However, by the start of Mother`s Rosario, 3 members: Ran, Clovis and Merida, died and 2 more members were declared to not last past Spring, thus the members of the Sleeping Knights decided to find the most joyful, most beautiful and most exciting virtual world and work together to accomplish something grand in the world to permanently leave their mark on it before disbanding once another member disappeared.
Eventually, they came across ALfheim Online and decided to leave their mark on this world by defeating a Floor Boss with just 1 party to leave all of their names on the Monument of Swordsmen.

<summary>Nearly a year after the Sword Art Online incident, a new VRMMORPG known as Gun Gale Online has taken Japan by storm. One day, as a top-ranked player named XeXeeD appears on a streamed broadcast via his avatar, a cloaked man calling himself and his weapon "Death Gun" fires a bullet at XeXeeD`s avatar through a video screen, causing XeXeeD to suddenly convulse and disconnect. A month later, Kirigaya Kazuto is called to meet up with Kikuoka Seijirou of the Ministry of Internal Affairs` Virtual Division, who reveals that XeXeeD`s user was found dead of acute heart failure a few days after his avatar was shot, also showing evidence of a similar case involving the death of a second GGO user. As Kazuto states his doubts that a game could cause someone`s heart to fail, Kikuoka, believing Death Gun is specifically targeting professional GGO players, asks Kazuto to once again take up the role of Kirito and investigate what is causing the victims to die. Remembering all the people who died in SAO, Kazuto thinks over his decision whilst spending time with Asuna at the park. Meanwhile, in the world of GGO, a sniper known as Sinon is in top form.

<summary>Kirito logs into GGO, but becomes baffled as to why his avatar has long hair and feminine qualities. These attributes lead to all of the male players mistaking him for a girl. Without many leads on how to reveal himself to Death Gun, Kirito wanders around the city until he spots Sinon. He explains to her that he wants to find directions to the General Governor`s Office to sign up for Bullet of Bullets (BoB), an intense PvP game mode. Mistaking him for a girl as well, Sinon directs Kirito towards a market to buy weaponry and armor. However, being out of cash, Kirito participates in an arcade game, "Untouchable", an extremely difficult QuickDraw game where the player must dodge the bullets fired from an NPC and then tag him to receive all of the credits placed in for bets. Sinon warns him the game is rigged, but after witnessing a player fail to win the game, Kirito decides to participate. Using the agility and training he acquired from his previous experiences in ALO (Alfheim Online), he is able to dodge all of the bullets and win all of the earnings, which surprises Sinon and other onlookers. Back at the weapon shop, Kirito mulls over the better weapons with the aid of Sinon, and decides to purchase an energy sword called a Photon Sword, then an FN Five-seven at Sinon`s request. Back outside, Sinon realizes they only have ten minutes to get to the General Governor`s Office and sign up for BoB, but Kirito spots a buggy station and commandeers one of the buggies, taking himself and Sinon to the Office down a highway. Impressed and exhilarated with his driving abilities, Sinon tells Kirito to go faster.

<summary>While walking home, Asada Shino, Sinon`s real-life counterpart, is bullied by three schoolmates, led by Endou, but they are warded away by her friend Shinkawa Kyouji, who introduced her to GGO in the first place, as a form of immersion therapy for her fear of guns. After talking about their personal lives, Shino leaves for home. There, she tries holding a gun replica, but this induces a flashback to when she was eleven years old; while she was at a postal office with her mother, a man carrying a gun tried to rob the office, shooting an employee and threatening to kill other people. When the robber aimed his gun at her mother, Shino attacked him, wrestled the gun out of his hand, and shot him repeatedly, killing him. The flashback triggers a panic attack from Shino. Meanwhile, Kirito informs Asuna that he will be converting his ALO avatar to GGO, which surprises her, but she approves. As Kazuto, he goes to the hospital to log into GGO, while his real-life body will be watched by Aki Natsuki, a nurse who oversaw his condition while he was trapped in SAO. Shino logs into GGO as well. Meanwhile, Death Gun overhears an online voice-chat discussing Death Gun before looking at a photo of Sinon, grinning hungrily.

<summary>In a flashback, on September 14, 2025, Sinon, who had accidentally fallen down a trap chute while navigating a dungeon below SBC Gurokken in GGO, discovers a boss-class monster and decides to die while trying to defeat it. To her surprise, the position she chose for her attack was out of the monster`s attack range, and thus, by conserving her ammo and accurately hitting the boss`s weak spot, she is eventually able to defeat it and acquire a new sniper rifle, the PGM Ultima Ratio Hecate II. In the present day, during an ambush on an enemy squadron, Sinon attempts to snipe a target, but he turns out to be a bodyguard named "Behemoth", who overwhelms her squadron with a heavy machine gun. When Sinon and Behemoth are the only ones remaining on the battlefield, Sinon manages to shoot Behemoth with her Hecate while falling from the air, earning her victory in the gunfight, despite suffering severe damage to her avatar. Meanwhile, in Alfheim Online, Kirito plans to tell Asuna about something.

<summary>Kirito and Sinon arrive at the General Governor`s Office and go to the terminals to register. Kirito is surprised that the registration asks for his real-life information, and he leaves the fields blank. He is then registered into the same block as Sinon, and both are able to make it to the finals due to the ladder arrangement. Before they can enter BoB, however, there is a qualifying preliminary. Kirito promises to fight Sinon fairly if they are ever opponents. While waiting for the preliminary round to begin, Kirito reveals his gender after an embarrassing incident with Sinon in the changing room, and this creates a rift between them. Sinon demands that he make it to the finals so she can defeat him there, then proclaims her intention of "killing all the strong ones", which causes Kirito to briefly suspect her of being Death Gun. They then meet up with Kyouji in his GGO avatar, Spiegel. When Kirito is transferred to his first battle, he is initially put off-balance in the gunfight, but is able to defeat his first opponent using his Photon Sword. Upon returning to the preliminary waiting area, he is confronted by Death Gun, who Kirito feels he recognizes. Death Gun asks Kirito if he is the "real deal". He then catches a glimpse of a tattoo on Death Gun`s wrist and recognizes it as the mark of the SAO Red Player guild "Laughing Coffin".

<summary>Kirito pretends to not understand Death Gun`s answer, and Death Gun states that he will kill him, whether or not he is the real Kirito, before leaving. Kirito then has a flashback to his time in SAO, when he and several others battled Laughing Coffin, and notes that he killed two members during that battle. He then realizes that the player who confronted him was actually Death Gun. Sinon later meets up with him and senses that something is wrong, but before Kirito can confide in her, he is teleported to his next duel, which he wins. Eventually, both Kirito and Sinon have made it into the finals. While waiting for Kirito, Sinon begins to feel he is just like her. She becomes frustrated when Kirito calmly walks straight toward her position, seemingly unwilling to dodge her bullet. Sinon fires at him repeatedly, but misses, and she personally confronts him about it. Remembering the promise he made to Sinon, Kirito apologizes and sets the rules for a rematch: he would move away by ten meters, and they would start fighting once he throws a bullet to the ground. Despite Sinon`s Hecate`s one-hundred percent hit rate at such a range, Kirito shows his confidence in his abilities. When the rematch begins, Kirito is able to slice Sinon`s bullet in half and hold her at the tip of his Photon Sword. Realizing that Kirito predicted the bullet path by watching her eyes, Sinon realizes that his strength goes beyond a virtual game and asks him what he is afraid of. He implies to her his experiences in SAO are not strength, but skill. He then asks her to surrender, since he doesn`t want to defeat a girl. In anger, she does so, stating that next time would be different.

<summary>While waiting for BoB to begin, Kirito assumes that Death Gun will sign into the tournament under a different name, given the perfect stage for him, and vows to find him and face him again. After much persistence, Kirito is able to convince Sinon to explain to him the details of the BoB royale. After she explains the rules and regulations, Kirito stops Sinon from leaving and asks her whether there were BoB participants that she did not know about. He then finds out that, aside from him, there are three other players who had not participated in the previous tournaments. He then explains her his motivation behind that question, and she theorizes from his explanation that he is an SAO survivor. Later on, during the tournament, Sinon decides to target Dyne and Pale Rider. Having found a sniping position on the west side of the bridge that Dyne had crossed, she prepares to take action, but is stopped by Kirito, who instructs her to not shoot and just watch Dyne and Pale Rider`s battle. After Pale Rider defeats Dyne, he is suddenly shot with a silenced stun bullet and, after several moments, the shooter, Death Gun, reveals himself from the bridge. As Death Gun prepares to finish off Pale Rider, Kirito yells at the confused Sinon to shoot him before he does.

<summary>At the Kirigaya residence, Suguha shows Kazuto a news article about the participants of the BoB tournament, among which was Kirito`s name. Although Kazuto tries to hide the fact that he converted his avatar to GGO, Suguha tells him that she already found out from Asuna. After a flashback of Kazuto`s talk with Asuna the previous day, Suguha tells him that she is worried due to Kazuto having a frightening expression when he returned home last night. Kazuto then calms Suguha down by promising that he would be back. Meanwhile, Sinon vents her anger about Kirito to Kyouji, who then tells her that she isn`t acting like her normal self and, after a short conversation, tries to hug her, but is rejected by her. At the hospital, after seeing that Kazuto was troubled by something, Aki offers a free counseling session. When Kazuto tells her about how he killed the Laughing Coffin members in SAO, she tells him that she cannot help him with that burden, but reminds him that he killed them in order to protect others. After calming down, Kazuto logs into GGO. Meanwhile, in Alfheim Online, after completing a boss fight, Asuna, Leafa (Suguha), Klein, Lisbeth, and Silica get ready to watch the broadcast of the BoB tournament. In GGO, Sinon meets Kirito at the General Governor`s Office, and they tell each other that they will not lose.

<summary>Sinon shoots at Death Gun, but he dodges the bullet and then kills Pale Rider with his pistol. Death Gun then introduces himself and his gun to the spectators, finishing his monologue with a catchphrase used by PoH, the founder of Laughing Coffin. Meanwhile, Sinon attempts to find out Death Gun`s name, but he was not shown on the satellite scan, thus Sinon assumes that he traveled through the battlefield underwater. She and Kirito then decide to follow Death Gun, eventually going to the Lost City. However, since they could not find him along the way, they look for him during the next scan. Seeing that two players, Sterben and Gunner X, were present in the city, they decide to go after Gunner X, as his name sounded like Death Gun  backwards. During the scan, they find Gunner X at a stadium, while Sterben abruptly vanishes from the city. The two rush to the stadium and, after confirming that there was a sniper, decide to split up. However, before Sinon could take a sniping position, she is suddenly shot with a stun bullet. Death Gun, who is actually Sterben, appears and proclaims that he is going to kill her. Sinon tries to defend herself, but then sees that Death Gun is carrying the Type 54 Black Star, the same weapon she used to kill the robber at the post office.

<summary>Before Death Gun could shoot Sinon, he is interrupted by Kirito, who shoots him in the shoulder with a sniper rifle and then throws a smoke grenade, which forces him to retreat. Kirito then grabs the stunned Sinon and flees to a nearby buggy and horse rental point. While commandeering a buggy, he orders Sinon to shoot the only functional mechanical horse to make it unusable. However, Sinon is unable to exert force on the trigger, and Death Gun catches up and takes control of the mechanical horse. During the subsequent chase, Death Gun fires at Kirito and Sinon with his pistol, terrifying the latter. When Sinon tries to shoot at Death Gun, Kirito is forced to help her pull the trigger. Though the shot misses Death Gun, it hits the fuel tank of a truck, which explodes and forces Death Gun to abandon his horse, allowing Kirito and Sinon to escape. The two then drive into the desert, where they find a cave that they hide in to avoid the next satellite scan. Inside, both Sinon and Kirito confide to each other that they have killed someone in the past.

<summary>After hearing that Kirito had killed people in SAO, Sinon asks him how he was able to overcome the memories of the people he killed, but Kirito reveals that he didn`t overcome them, instead accepting the weight of them, since it was all he could do to atone for his actions. Then, while thinking about how Death Gun was able to stop the heart of players by shooting them in the game, Kirito realizes that Death Gun did not shoot him with the pistol, but with the sniper instead. Based on this, Kirito deduces that Death Gun had to make preparations in real life to be able to kill the players with his pistol, and that he could`ve seen players putting their real-life details in the General Governor`s Office since it was an open space and the terminals did not offer much privacy. Kirito then brings up the idea that Death Gun could have used his mantle to spy on other players without being noticed. After some thinking, Kirito realizes that Death Gun was actually two people: one shoots the player in-game, the other kills the player in real life by injecting them with a lethal drug. Meanwhile, Kikuoka Seijirou logs onto ALO as Chrysheight under Asuna`s request and, after Yui reveals all the information on the incident that she had gathered, Chrysheight explains the situation to Asuna and the others. Asuna then requests Kazuto`s whereabouts and decides to go to him in real life. Back in GGO, Kirito and Sinon decide on a course of action and are surprised to find out that they were being filmed by one of the cameras.

<summary>After checking the map, Kirito finds that twenty-four players had already been killed, while only Dark Wind and himself are shown on the map. Seeing as, even accounting for Sinon, Death Gun, and Pale Rider, the numbers of those killed and those who are still alive did not match the total, he speculates that Death Gun had more than one accomplice in charge of the killings in the real world. Fearing that Dark Wind might also be a target, Kirito and Sinon decide to set up the former as bait, while Sinon snipes Dark Wind and Death Gun from a distance when they arrive. Sometime later, while Dark Wind is closing in on Kirito, Death Gun attempts to kill Kirito himself. Sensing his intent to kill, Kirito manages to sense where he would be shot from and barely manages to dodge the bullet. Noticing a sniper shot, Dark Wind immediately hides behind an obstacle for cover, but he is then shot by Sinon and killed. Sinon then turns her attention to Death Gun, but, as she had already fired her first shot, which wouldn`t be detected, Death Gun is able to see her targeting him. The two of them fire at each other at the same time and, while Death Gun manages to destroy Sinon`s scope, she manages to destroy Death Gun`s weapon. However, as Kirito is about to strike Death Gun, the latter pulls out an estoc and counters the attack. After having a conversation with Kirito, Death Gun begins assaulting him with overwhelming speed.

<summary>Death Gun continues his assault on Kirito, greatly weakening him. While they are fighting, Kirito has a flashback to the meeting before the Laughing Coffin raid in Sword Art Online, recalling a strikingly similar player with the same red eyes as Death Gun. Kirito deduces that Death Gun is really Red-Eyed XaXa, the second-in-command of Laughing Coffin. As XaXa moves in for the final blow, Sinon creates the illusion of a bullet path using her experience in the game alone, causing XaXa to use his invisibility cloak to avoid it. However, Kirito pulls out his sidearm and fires it at XaXa, stopping the cloaking process and rendering him vulnerable. Using the willpower and strength he possessed in SAO, Kirito defeats XaXa, cutting him cleanly in half. Before he dies, XaXa reassures Kirito that their battle is not over. Kirito and Sinon then come to an agreement to end the BoB tournament by committing double in-game suicide using a grenade, crowning them both the winner, but not before they reveal to each other their real names. While logging out, Kirito finds that another BoB participant besides Pale Rider was mysteriously disconnected, confirming his suspicions that Death Gun has more than one accomplice. After logging out, Kyouji visits Shino, who, after making romantic advances on her, pulls out a syringe and reveals himself to be Death Gun`s second accomplice in the real-world killings. Kyouji then tries to kill Shino, but Kazuto bursts through Shino`s door and attacks Kyouji, holding him off while telling Shino, who recognizes Kazuto as Kirito, to run.

<summary>While Kazuto tries to defend himself against Kyouji, he leaves an opening for the latter to attempt to inject him with the poison used to kill Death Gun`s victims. Shino then knocks Kyouji out with a stereo before checking on Kazuto`s condition, and finds that there was an electrode stuck to the part of his chest where Kyouji had tried to inject him, which protected him against the syringe. Several days later, Endou calls out to Shino, from whom she tries to demand money. When Shino refuses, Endou takes out a model gun and threatens her. However, when she unsuccessfully tries to fire it, Shino takes the gun from Endou and shows her that the safety needed to be disabled to fire, then shoots a can with it before returning it back to Endou. Shino is then picked up by Kazuto, who takes her to meet with Kikuoka to report on the Death Gun incident. During the report, it is revealed that the third conspirator in the Death Gun murders, another SAO survivor named Johnny Black, escaped while Kyouji and XaXa (who was Kyouji`s brother) were both institutionalized. After that, Kazuto takes Shino to the Dicey Cafe, where he introduces her to Asuna and Rika (Lisbeth). Kazuto then reveals that he had told the two girls about Shino`s past and explains that he had them help him find a certain person that she should meet. The person is revealed to have been a woman, named Oosawa Sachie, who was working at the post office during the robbery. Sachie thanks Shino for saving her life and tells her that she was pregnant at the time, so Shino had also saved the life of her daughter, Mizue. Kazuto then explains that he wants Shino to think about the people that she had saved by killing the robber and thus be able to forgive herself for it. As a result, Shino bursts into tears of happiness.

<summary>One day at the end of the year, Suguha shows Kazuto a news article about the legendary item, the Holy Sword Excaliber, being discovered in ALO. They then call Asuna, Klein, Lisbeth, Silica, and Sinon to challenge the dungeon in the sky of Jötunheimr, where Excaliber was located. After preparing their items at Lisbeth`s arms shop and purchasing potions for the adventure, the group enters Jötunheimr via a secret passageway in Alne. At the end of the tunnel, they reach the top of Jötunheimr and Leafa calls Tonkii, a flying evil-god-class monster that they had befriended several months ago. The group climbs on Tonkii`s back and asks it to take them to the dungeon. However, along the way, Tonkii suddenly dives downward and stops at an altitude where they could see the ground. There, they see that players were cooperating with the humanoid evil-god-class monsters to massacre Tonkii`s kin, the beast evil-god-class monsters. As they watch the scene, a giant NPC, the Queen of the Lake Urðr, appears behind them. She explains that the massacre was ordered by the king of the giants, Þrym, who once threw the Holy Sword Excaliber into Urðr`s Spring and caused the world of Jötunheimr to turn into an icy wasteland. She then states that if all of Tonkii`s kin are slaughtered, she would lose her power and this would allow Þrym to invade Alfheim. To prevent this, Urðr requests the fairies to retrieve the Holy Sword Excaliber from the bottom of the ice dungeon, called Þrymheimr.

<summary>At the entrance to Thrymheim, Yui explains that the quest the group was given was created by the Cardinal System`s Automatic Quest Generation Function and that if they do not succeed in their quest, a final war event, Ragnarok, will be triggered and the world of ALO will be subsequently destroyed, something the Cardinal System is capable of doing. Because they had worked so hard to develop their avatars, the group becomes more determined to finish the quest. At the end of the second floor of Thrymheimr, the group encounters two minotaurs, and they are forced to rely on Sword Skills that could deal elemental damage to them in addition to physical damage, but also leave the player rigid for a few seconds after the skill is used up. With Kirito revealing his new technique of using consecutive Sword Skills with each of his swords to avoid the period of rigidity, they are able to defeat the two minotaurs. Later, after defeating the boss guarding the entrance to the lowest floor of the castle, they encounter a female NPC trapped in an ice cage along the way. Although the others insist that it is a trap and plan to avoid her, Klein, captivated by the woman`s beauty, ignores their advice and frees the woman, who introduces herself as Freyja. Instead of running away, Freyja asks to join the group and Kirito reluctantly agrees to the request. After preparing for the final battle by recharging their buffs, the group enters the throne room, where they are met by the massive king of the frost giants, Thrym.

<summary>Thrym engages the group in battle, and they are supported by Freyja, who overwhelms Thrym with her own attacks. Thrym retaliates by freezing most of the group with an ice breath, then sending them flying backward with a powerful stomp of his foot. Just as he is about to finish them off, the uninjured Sinon distracts Thrym while the others search for a large golden hammer purported by Freyja to belong to her family, which is essential in defeating him. Kirito finds the hammer and throws it to Freyja, who catches it and then suddenly transforms into Thor, the Norse god of thunder, to everyone`s shock. Thor, enraged at Thrym for stealing his hammer, then joins the group in the fight against Thrym. Eventually, they manage to overwhelm him before Thor finishes him off. As a reward for aiding him in Thrym`s defeat, Thor grants Klein with Mjölnir, much to his dissatisfaction. A secret staircase then opens up, which leads the group to the bottom of Þrymheimr, and Excaliber. Kirito manages to pull it out of the frozen puddle, but it causes Þrymheimr to fall apart. As the floor they are on plunges down a chasm, they are saved by Tonkii, and Kirito, knowing that Excaliber is too heavy for him to jump onto Tonkii with, throws it down the chasm, but Sinon retrieves it with a magic-assisted arrow. She gives Excaliber back to Kirito under the condition that he remember her every time he uses the sword earning jealous and angry looks from everyone. The group then observes as the chasm is flooded with water and the World Tree`s roots extend to its surface, causing new trees to grow. Urðr and her sisters Verdandi and Skuld appear and thank them for saving Jötunheimr, and Urðr gifts Kirito with Excaliber. Sometime later, in the real world, Kazuto, Suguha, and Shino test out a device that converts real-time footage into pseudo-3D for Yui to interact with, before having lunch with the rest of the group, celebrating the conclusion of the quest.

<summary>After agreeing to meet everyone the next day, Asuna logs out of ALO to have dinner with her mother Kyouko. During the meal, Kyouko is dissatisfied with Asuna being a gamer and tells her that she wants her to transfer to a more proper school. She then reveals that she has hired a personal tutor for her so she could speed up her education, and that she was given an application for an oriented high school that would be able to efficiently teach her in order for her to go to college at a faster rate. Asuna also realizes that Kyouko investigated Kazuto; Kyouko objects to their relationship. Asuna abruptly leaves, but not before insulting her mother. In her room, Asuna laments about how she wanted to stay by Kazuto`s side and the fact that, while she may have been powerful in SAO, she was powerless in the real world. The next day, Asuna meets with Kirito on the 24th Floor of New Aincrad, and Kirito shares his impressions of Absolute Sword. Leafa, Lisbeth, and Silica then arrive and remind them that Asuna had a duel to get to. At the island, Asuna discovers that Absolute Sword was actually a girl named Yuuki. Asuna challenges Yuuki and finds out how skillful she is. During the duel, Asuna tries activating a rapier Sword Skill, Quadruple Pain, but Yuuki manages to block her attacks and then activates her own Sword Skill. Suffering heavy blows, Asuna activates her Original Sword Skill, Starry Tear. However, while she had used up her last attack, Yuuki`s Sword Skill is continuous. However, before she could defeat Asuna, Yuuki stops her assault, then states that she was satisfied with the duel. Yuuki then takes Asuna to Aincrad, where she asks for her help.

<summary>During a date at Andrew`s (Agil) cafe, Kazuto and Asuna start talking about their old home in Aincrad. Andrew tells them about the revealed contents of the upcoming ALO update, including the introduction of the 21st-30th floors of New Aincrad. On Christmas Eve, when the update takes place, the group challenges the 21st Floor Boss, and after a fierce battle, the group manages to reach the 22nd Floor, and Kirito and Asuna purchase their old home again. Later on, as the group does homework at the house, Lisbeth asks Asuna if she heard of stories about Absolute Sword, an unbeatable player who had likely converted his or her avatar from another game and was challenging other players at an island on the 24th Floor. As Asuna was away during the New Year and did not have access to the Internet, she is unaware of the story. The group decides to challenge Absolute Sword, but Leafa and Lisbeth are all beaten easily. Silica notes that players would likely continue to challenge the mysterious player as they are betting a powerful 11-hit Original Sword Skill. Kirito also fights Absolute Sword and loses. Asuna decides to challenge the player herself, but at that moment, she notices that it is already past her dinnertime. Before she logs out, she asks Lisbeth if Absolute Sword could be an SAO survivor. Lisbeth replies that she asked Kirito what he thought about Absolute Sword after battling him or her; he replied that the player could not have been an SAO survivor, as his Dual Blades skill would have been given to him or her instead of him.

<summary>Yuuki takes Asuna to an inn in Ronbaru and introduces her to the other members of the Sleeping Knights: Jun, Nori, Siune, Talken and Tecchi. Yuuki then reveals that the guild wanted Asuna`s help in defeating the next Floor Boss with just one party. Siune explains that the group wanted to defeat the boss in order to etch their names on the Monument of Swordsmen, as they would not be able to adventure together after winter. After some thinking, Asuna agrees to help. Sometime later, while she is walking to the Teleport Gate plaza, Kyouko disconnects Asuna from the game and they have a disagreement. Asuna decides to go to a park in another residential area and considers calling Kazuto, but decides that she did not want to expose her weakness to him. The next day, she meets up with the Sleeping Knights and they easily manage to reach the boss room, but Asuna detects several other players hiding near there. Though the players claim they are waiting for their friends, Asuna realizes they were actually spying on their battle to study the boss without sacrificing their own men. After the Sleeping Knights and Asuna are defeated and re-spawn in Ronbaru, Asuna tells the others what she discovered and they decide to rush to the boss room again before the guild had enough time to gather a raid group. At the boss room, they find a large amount of players gathered at the door. As the guild rejects the request of the Sleeping Knights to let them try again, Yuuki declares that they would fight it out, and attacks the raid group`s leader. At that point, the rest of the raid party arrives, but Kirito appears, having followed them, and blocks their path.

<summary>While Kirito battles the raid party`s reinforcements, the Sleeping Knights engage the forces blocking the path to the boss room. However, seeing that their assault was useless due to the guild`s healers, Asuna asks Siune to manage the healing herself, and uses Flashing Penetrator to break through to the healers while killing the group`s leader. After the healers are disposed of, followed by the rest of the players, Asuna and the others enter the boss room. During the boss battle, Asuna deduces the boss`s weak point and orders Yuuki to use a Sword Skill. Following Asuna`s suggestion to use Tecchi as a stepping stone, Yuuki defeats the boss with her signature Original Sword Skill. With the mission concluded, the group agrees to celebrate at Asuna`s in-game home. While conversing about various things, Asuna asks whether she could join the Sleeping Knights and notices the unpleasant reactions of the others. The group then goes to the Monument of Swordsmen, where they take a picture. Afterwards, Yuuki accidentally addresses Asuna as her elder sister. Since Yuuki also did so back in the boss room, Asuna points this out to her and Yuuki unexpectedly starts crying and abruptly logs out.

<summary>On the day after Asuna`s reunion with Yuuki, Asuna takes a Bidirectional Communication Probe to guide Yuuki around the school. Yuuki takes part in the lectures and becomes popular with her classmates. Afterwards, Asuna takes Yuuki to the old Konno residence, which Yuuki reveals is about to be torn down soon, so she wished to see it for one last time. She then admits that by seeing her house she realized how her mother had been surrounding her with her feelings. Asuna tells Yuuki about her relationship with her own mother and asks Yuuki how to be as strong as her. However, Yuuki claims that she was not strong, but instead, she did not feel like she had time to waste, so she would always be honest with her feelings. She then recommends Asuna to talk with her mother and share what she felt. Using Yuuki`s advice, Asuna asks Kyouko to log into ALO with her so she could show it to her. Kyouko reluctantly agrees and uses Asuna`s sub account to log in. At the Forest House, Kyouko is reminded of her parents` home. Asuna then tells her mother about how happy her parents were of her and how they wished to protect their home so Kyouko would have a place to return to. Asuna then says that she realized how life was not about just doing things for oneself and how the happiness of others could make one happy as well, thus she wanted to remain in her current school where she could support the ones she loved. The next morning, Kyouko tells Asuna that if she planned to support someone, she had to be strong herself, thus she would have to work hard on her grades to get into a university and whether Asuna would have to transfer would depend on her progress.

<summary>Three days later after the incident at the Monument of Swordsmen, Asuna tries asking Siune about Yuuki`s behavior. She responds that Yuuki was trying to avoid Asuna for her own sake, then asks Asuna to forget about the Sleeping Knights before logging out. At school, Asuna meets up with Kazuto, who gives her the address to a hospital where a medical FullDive machine, the Medicuboid, was being tested. At the hospital, Asuna meets Doctor Kurahashi, Yuuki`s supervisor, who explains the Medicuboid`s usage for patients in terminal care. Kurahashi then reveals that Yuuki was suffering from AIDS due to an infection via blood transfusion during complicated labor. After Asuna asks why Yuuki started using the Medicuboid, Kurahashi explains that he had her put in a clean room at his own request so she would not risk further infection, and reveals that Yuuki had been living inside the machine for three years straight, not returning to the real world at all. Asuna then learns about Yuuki`s elder twin sister, who passed away the year before, causing her to break down in tears. Seeing this, Yuuki communicates with Asuna via the Medicuboid, asking her to meet at the place where they first met in ALO. Asuna uses the AmuSphere in the next room to log into the game and rushes to Yuuki`s location. There, the two talk, during which Yuuki expresses her wish of going to school again.

<summary>Three days after Yuuki Asuna talked with her mother, Asuna held a barbecue at the Forest House. During the barbecue, Jun brought up that they could beat the 28th Floor Boss. The enthusiastic group decided to take a tour through the 28th Floor Labyrinth, where they ended up beating the boss.
Over the following months: Konno Yuuki continued to attend classes at the SAO Survivor School; the fairies had a race in Alfheim; the Sleeping Knights and Asuna defeated the 29th Floor boss; a swordsmanship tournament was held in ALfheim Online which Yuuki won after a fierce battle with Kirito; Asuna kept her promise and worked hard on her grades; Asuna organised a trip to Kyoto, with all the members of the Sleeping Knights using Kazuto`s probe to take part in the trip.
However, near the end of March, Asuna received a message from Doctor Kurahashi that Yuuki`s condition was worsening. Asuna rushed over to the hospital, but found out that Yuuki`s condition was critical and that nothing more could be done. While holding Yuuki`s hand, Asuna realised that Yuuki wanted to return to the virtual world, thus she asked Kurahashi to allow her to FullDive. On the 24th Floor, at the island where Asuna and Yuuki first met, Yuuki created a scroll for her Original Sword Skill and passed it to Asuna, in hopes that it would protect her. Just then, the members of the Sleeping Knights arrived to cheer Yuuki in her final moments. The Sleeping Knights were followed by Kirito, Klein, Leafa, Lisbeth, Silica, Sinon, and Yui. Finally, a large group of fairies of various races gathered at the island, and Asuna revealed that she had notified everyone so that Yuuki would not have a lonely farewell. Yuuki then told Asuna how she had always asked herself what was the reason for her living if she was destined to die anyway, but then said that she had found the reason, as her last moments were truly fulfilling. After Asuna promised to meet her in another world, Yuuki peacefully passed away.
A week later, at Yuuki`s memorial, Asuna met with Siune, whose condition was improving. After they talked about Yuuki, Kazuto and doctor Kurahashi joined their conversation. As Kazuto and Kurahashi explained that they were talking about Kazuto`s probe`s application for medical FullDive technology, Asuna asked about the tests for the Medicuboid. Kurahashi revealed that Yuuki had provided more than enough data, and claimed that Yuuki should get a reward like the person who provided the initial designs. As Asuna was surprised that the Medicuboid designs came from an external helper, Kurahashi revealed that the helper was professor Koujiro Rinko. The shocked Kazuto then revealed that Rinko was the person who took care of http://anidb.net/ch43412 [Kayaba Akihiko] during the SAO incident, thus the Medicuboid designs actually came from Akihiko.
Some time later, the group had a picnic.
