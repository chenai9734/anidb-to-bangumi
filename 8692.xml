<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="531127">A good anime with a great start, nice characters, fights and interesting story about MMO , but I`m a little disagree with the end and all after first half. It could have been a best anime. For me 7/10.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="299186">Sword Art Online started strong but about half way into the series the fanservice took over. Don`t get your hopes up for the greatness to continue throughout the series.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="479958">One of the best anime ever seen 
A well done combination of action and romance , but  in my opinion what really stood out were the feelings and the reality of it
I wish I could go to SAO xPPP</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="378121">Well i know most mmorpg fans are getting tired of the usual system and want to try out this awesome future virtual reality so that`s why its popular. So mmorpg fans are the ones that will really appreciate this kind of an anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="1083">As usual the changes made compared to the genial light novels made this anime adaptation an average fantasy.
Superfluous additional female characters (all of them cute of course) right at the start made this almost a harem anime. This is totally the opposed to the novels. And also goes against the reality of MMO-s what was an important factor that made this story unique.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="146198">bit slow to start but gets better towards the end.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="195647">SAO is a potpourri of different genres represented in different qualities and in two parts. Its premise, although cliched, is interesting enough to keep watching the show.Also Characters are likeable and the quality is good.
The BIG PROBLEM with this show is, that i has huge time jumps. Especially the first part of the show suffers. Where people want to see development (at least i felt that way) in the purest RPG sense, they are confronted with huge jumps between levels leaving out what could have been interesting.
 The second part alienates the concept of the whole first part of the show and gives off a different vibe. It also introduces character development, that seems rather deus-ex-machina style. All in all this show is not bad but it should not have been rushed and it should have been seperated into two seasons. Therefore i feel this show is currently overrated by anidb standards. It is still a good watch, but could not make it into the book of greats, unfortunately.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="338163">Fans of MMORPG games will get the most out of this. Reminds me of playing UO when nobody knew how to play. MMO was a new thing, as with the VR in this. Good story, setting, and characters so far.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="307987">This could have been a master piece if the edited it down a bit and stopped halfway. i`m really disappointed in the direction it went at that point. its really a shame.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="445355">Entertaining action-packed MMO Story that will appeal to MMO lovers and players, but overall theme and plot of racing for your life just seems to be blissfully ignored.   Feels like they are just wanting to write a straight MMO story but were forced to adapt an established property.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="88664">If the first episode of this anime is any indication this will be a fantastic series. I`m hoping it may even trump Druaga itself.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="581931">Rly wide range storyline, good romance, nice story, cool superpowers.
Just awesome fantasy anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="313895">It started off really good, a lot of action, fast-pacing but after some point when they started the second arc it just went downhill and started sucking a lot. I wouldn`t recommend it to someone who is looking for a good dose of entertainment, it`s more of a time-killer anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="273035">If this is Solo Playing, they dont know what is forever alone/nerd/ or true game. For fans only, he change mind more often than women shoes.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="53032">1st arc: VASTLY overrated, but still quite good. Despite some nagging plot holes and Mary Sue/Gary Stu moments (especially towards the end of the arc), it`s still easily better than the mediocrity that is its sibling "Accel World".

2nd arc: Pretty much throws away any pretence of actually being set within a real game, recycling the same old cliches you`ve seen in countless shonen series whilst barely attempting to cover them with MMO veneer, repeatedly requires both characters and viewers to be wilfully blind to ignore blatant contrivances and plot holes, down to even an 11th hour literal deus ex machina victory against an utterly one-dimensional antagonist.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="241461">This is the best anime of the year, and I have seen moste of them. I strongly recommend this anime. if u compare it to another anime I woud say that hunter x hunter greed island is some what close to this in genre.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="447017">Good start, but turns out it`s narrated episodically. Doesn`t really seem coherent at all and leaves out most of the elements you`d want to know about, just to hit you in the face with a short story of what happened somewhere sometime. 1st half ending was basically an asspull without any buildup. Half assed romance, half assed battles and half assed storytelling in what could otherwise be a really exciting setting.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="69845">The battle animations make up for every negative comment you could think for this show. If you still think this is a waste of your time, watch the OP/ED and skip the rest also works.  Enough said.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="367685">The first half is pretty great. The story is interesting and there are many likable characters. The second half is not that great. There are some cool things and some things that I strongly disliked.

In the end, SAO was a fun anime that brought back memories from my MMO days and made me wonder about the future possibilities of MMO games.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="186852">SAO was surprisingly good. For one such as me who do not particularly enjoy MMOs this had a crucial plot component which made it much more interesting. Unfortunately the plot took a turn for the worse around episode 14, which dragged it down considerably. To be honest they could have stopped at episode 14, it`s almost like two separate series. 1-14 was amazing, and worth every second, quite possibly the best I have seen in a long time. It`s astounding how close you grew to the characters in such a short time, it was masterful of them to squeeze all that into 14 episodes. Just a pity they didn`t save much for the rest of the series.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="240447">The first arch was pretty interesting. The second arch was a bit of a disappointment. Overall a pretty good series.

I feel that mmorpg players will get the best out of SAO because they`ll be able to appreciate the beautiful backgrounds, the environment and the bounty of feelings that the characters show.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="56708">What a great opening story, the premise, the people getting stranded in the virtual world. but yes, the first half is better than the 2nd half. after watching it, i feel it could`ve been done so much better.. still, its almost battle royale-esque in a away, which is the best thing about it (1st half at least)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="70839">Nowhere as good as .hack//sign but still a very enjoyable anime till episode 14. I had fun watching it. Just do yourself a favor and stop watching at 14. The second half is extremely bad. It feels like it was written by a different person than the first half.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="286723">Read the light novel. Was brilliant. The anime looks like it`s gearing up to that aspect as well. If you like good stories, give this a try. Recommended.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="420653">This is a must see. The plot, the anime, the soundtrack are just awesome. One of my favs of all times. A really good plot that diverges at the half of the show. Some say that the first half it`s what`s really great , but I must say that if you say this you didn`t understand the show at all. This really have it all: action, drama, really deep feelings, present and future, ... a masterpiece... you would really appreciate it as seinen, if you value this as shounen it`s great, but you probably won`t be able to understand all of it</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="248649">Incredibly the best anime of this season. It starts really good with a promising and original story and step by step loses its intensity toward the beginning of the second arc. In any case a good watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="114373">A Solid MMORPG anime. the plot is good with really nice characters development. For MMORPG fans it is a must see anime but for others, it could still be enjoyable.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="468231">First season 9/10
Seacond season 4/10
Wish they used all 25 episodes for the first season and removed the last season.
The series would most likely have been much better that way.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="547692">In the first episode it displays a good concept for a new anime this season. I anticipate a great story. I would recommend to anyone to watch this anime this season.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="755022">Very good anime with great story arcs.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="97537">Like watching WoW without the game pad...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="10227">I was a little sceptical at first because .hack//SIGN sucked. But this one is really cool - no boring main character and confusing plot. It`s all pretty obvious but still engaging. Great animation and music, loveable characters and a decent plot. Enough action and some emotional and deep moments.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="576556">This anime is one of my favorites .It has very good plot , cool main characters and some romance .I would be happy to watch it again so i think every fan of the genre will like it too :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="210547">I really recommended, people who play "mmo" game will love it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="117495">The first 14 episodes are so awesome, I mean the show is out of this world. Then the writers did some drugs, fried their brains and decided to screw the show completly.

So if you plan to watch this, go 1-14 and then watch episode 25 as the final episode. Skip 15-24, its not the same show.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="581152">Great animation, lovable characters and a main character who knows he`s strong(he doesn`t discover it by winning battles barely alive). About the ending, well... in my opinion it`s the beginning. The VRMMO`s are shown as a corruption unlike any other. At the end after all they had to endure they still go back, in other words once in you can never click the "log out" button.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="366520">truly decent anime, an anime i will watch again and again and again.... great story, simple but cute romance, all the characters are brilliant, that is until episode 14, after that it`s not bad but i would of preferred extension on the original story line, maybe more between Kirito and Asuna, more fights bosses and side stories not related to clearing a floor, i honestly cant get enough of this anime, even with the let down second half this is a must watch!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="437742">The first half is a must watch.  Once that part ends, just stop watching; you will be completely disappointed by the second half as it is stupid and unnecessary.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="420432">i watched it and liked it... so calm and amazin series. plot is really koool and thank god there are no boring characters in this anime. just watch it its one of the best of this year same as kuroko no basket.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="185992">This anime is enthralling from the start and abruptly loses its momentum mid way than gradually becomes less interesting until the finish line. The pace of this anime is fast which makes for some interesting developments and keeps the show intense. It however causes a setback in the manner where characters and the world dont get as flushed out as well as it could have been. While the latter of the anime was okay it just doesnt reach the quality of attention that the former possessed. There is also a shift of focus and emphasis in the story which could turn away some; transitioning from a survival adventure to heavy doses of romance and drama left and right and continues to expand on those points until the very end. The ending in some ways brought good closure and compensated a little bit for the lackluster second half. If this series only expanded and emphasized the shows strong points it just could have possibly reached greatness.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="481279">A solid watch with a fairly unique storyline and setting, especially for the first season (ep 01-14).

The first season has everything to make a great seinen anime: daunting plot, exotic fantasy-world setting, relatable yet powerful protagonist, cute romance, a measure of character development, intense action, and awesome animation &amp; music. The MMORPG setting really adds character to the series that few could pull off; although they didn`t use as much MMORPG jargon as I hoped they would. This anime would be a "must watch" if the last 11 episodes weren`t such a let-down in comparison. While the story-arch in the second season does make sense and continues were the first plot left off romantically, the drama, setting, action, and intensity greatly pale in comparison. So you can watch the last 11 episodes if you want to see where the romance ultimately goes, but if you don`t you`re not missing anything.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="579724">Its a pretty good anime overall well at least the first half is, I was actually pretty damn impressed with the first half I loved it for a matter of fact but then things started to get weird after episode 14 they should have just ended it there and then with 3~2 extra aftermath episodes that would have been perfect in my opinion.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="487479">Great anime, in every aspect from music to animation. It just sucks that there is so little they could do with the story. I felt it had so much more potential with the world than what they did. The ending was meh as well but it is still a must watch, albeit overrated a bit. Still can`t wait for any OVAs or a second season, definitely one of my favorites in a while.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="573698">Why was asuna not in the ending there when they were all going to the tower again....wtf is that shit? Great anime cleaned it out in 2 days but why show a dedicated relationship in the real world and then question it in the sense that he was there with his sister and asuna no where to be found..Few questions left in the anime, great concept 9/10 :)!! If they ended this anime on episode 14 or created a new aspect of the first dive 10/10. Still a must see for action/romance. Focuses heavily on both aspects which is VERY hard to find normally heavy action light romance or vice versa. Very balanced must see!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="566906">Flawless cast, and an inspiring history!
One of the best animes I`ve ever seen!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="611680">awesome animation+ romance+amazing twists=masterpiece=sao!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="82377">Have to say this is one amazing series. It starts off as yet another .hack// copy / generic fantasy, but quickly builds up into an epic that pulls you in completely. There`s joy, sadness, relief, anger, pure excitement, all bundled into those 25 episodes, intertwining and mixing seamlessly. A tiny spoiler here, the show goes through 3 "phases" that break up any monotony you`d expect from such a long series and each offer a different experience.

A good casual watch, but immerse yourself in the world and it becomes a truly wonderful journey.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="565188">this anime make me want to play MMORPG again.
a must see especially for MMORPG gamer and don`t forget to read the LN version for detail explanation about the anime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="209509">A truly incredible anime, characters and story are wonderful. Definitely worth watching!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="593070">Lot of action &amp; Amazing virtuality definitely must see</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="576920">Just rewatched episode 12 for the dozenth time. Still trembling in excitement.
The second half truly is a disappointment, though.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="411316">Not sure what else there is to say than what has already been said, so I`ll just repeat it :D!
The story is great, it`s fast paced but doesn`t rush anything, which is rare in itself. There`s a great deal of character development, which I think is why the protagonist is one of my favorite characters, the world changes him bit by bit, but the change isn`t "out of his character", it`s more a case of him maturing a great deal.
 The animation quality, voice acting, etc. is great as well!
I`m adding this to my list of all-time favorites!

Even if you aren`t all that interested in MMORPG`s, this is still an anime you can enjoy immensely, because the plot doesn`t focus on the fact that it`s an MMORPG more than necessary, so other than the first episode it`s more of a fantasy story.
That being said, if you are familiar with MMORPG`s like myself, you`re going to enjoy it even more ;).

In short, give it a try, you won`t regret it!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="610931">Epic!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="265326">So many seemingly bad reviews. This anime is just great. It shows how humans adapt to the game scenario, how some even forget what it was like in the real world. I loved the presentation of the characters, each one developing in certain areas, opening a bar, a trade shop, a blacksmith shop  and dedicating their efforts to finish the game and return to the real world.
What surprised me , and i was almost confident they would leave a huge hole, was the fact that their real bodies must be deteriorating being hooked on IVs in hospitals. They actually point that out also in the anime that a lot of players simply fainted in the game world as an effect. 
Just brilliant series, and it keeps a good grasp of reality. People waking up from the game experiencing physical handicaps like atrophied muscles and loss of senses.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="365524">AWESOME!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="442930">I thoroughly enjoyed this anime.  I came here to leave a simple rating, and noticed the average is over 8, yet the reviews average around a 5.  Half the people are angry at it because "it`s unrealistic to go against the programming of a game...."  Well.  That`s true.  But, this is anime, not a documentary.  It was wonderfully executed and always exciting to watch.  I`d suggest this for everyone.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="619127">It was a really nice blend of action, comedy and romance (which admittedly was dampened a bit by a slow second half). Aside from the super-awesome technology, I loved the tiny things they captured which I can relate to as a gamer. However, more than anything, I really hope this anime inspires the real-life version of this technology!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="492628">Epic, strange start but after that, epic.
The early episodes some things fell too rushed and others seam to drag too long. The author tryed to explain almost all the rules of the world in the early episodes.
After that it is pure epicness, once Asuna returns to the story, it never gets dull and it just gets better and better.
Must see</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="614621">A MUST SEE... And the  second half is BETTER than the first</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="571052">Taking the wonderful premise of the hack series but with a wonderful not too over the top love story mixed with all the elements we see and love from our favorite online rpg games. Also scroll around and watch all the flaming haters who write green recommendations cards in 2017 because they hate what ever is popular.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="31168">I love the character progression of both the main characters. It does feel a bit rushed with the introduction of new characters to only see them disappear in the next episode, but the events do eventually tie in to the protagonist`s character. Plus, it doesn`t feel like it affects the overall quality of the series unlike other series`.

The friendship love story is touching especially in the context of MMORPGs. Definitely looking forward to watching the next episode!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="172977">Up untill midway its probably one of the best anime i have ever seen. There was no reason at all for that sudden change, it could have been a masterpiece.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="177640">FIRST: THIS IS NOT HAREM! People who say that can`t tell what is harem or not.

Here we have a virtual, RPG like, world much more believable than any other anime that dealt with the theme before. This story is about character development and romance mainly, back off if you want to see amazing apotheotic fights 80% of the time, although there are some cool but short fights to see. Love is the fuel and it`s better developed and fulfilling that any shoujo I have seen recently. SAO is the best anime of the year and it`s better than the light novel it comes from.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="287128">It show really indepth about MMO, it is compulsory watch for MMO gamer. It show about dream of a VR MMO. It esp 1 show great storyline. there is no rush in the esp. great animation art.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="447833">I felt like this anime was taken straight from my daydreaming of what if? I`m reminded so much of times playing MMO`s. The anime has great art, the characters arent shallow, and show promise for future development. This is a must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="461432">One of the most beautiful, moving and best anime that i have ever seen.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="468958">One of the BEST.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="602204">one of the best I`ve seen in a long time.. keeps you hooked and u won`t be able to move away from the screen..</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="233579">One of my favorite novels got a good adaptation. There are some flaws (especially some cuts in episodes adapted from side stories), but I still think that this is the best series in the season.
PS: Sorry for bad English ;)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="159558">Haven`t see a great Anime like this in years.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="719319">What to say??....A must watch Anime in evryone`s Anime list!! U will really njoy it!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="524408">the first half of the anime is amazing .. the second part however is not that great .. would have liked it more if the second half was like the first</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="306187">one of my favorite animes ever !! great animation , great story , great romance , great action , everything is great ...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="23892">A must see!!! ^_^</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="332307">I don`t like MMORPG but i like the anime. It`s somehow mature stuff. Love, lonelines, friendship, action, heart break... All you need is in one. Definetely a must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="291819">After the first episode I went and read all the novels.  I can tell you so far the show has followed them almost word for word.  Only exceptions are to cut down some thing for time constrants which is understandable.

The books were brilliant and I loved them, the show is just as good.  Its got a great concept and the characters show real impact after events.  People are worried about the side stories but if you read the books there is purpose for them at later times.

Its not useless fluff fillers like a lot of bleach and naruto that have no bearing on the main story.  Give this anime a try, if you like it read the books.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="303812">Just one word to describe this : Awesome!!! In every aspect of the anime. I really love this anime. ^^</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="443072">Great anime the atmosphere is awesome ,allaways refering to skills and stats brings the nerd out of me and the story is solid too. Plus the main carater reminds me my first mmo, wondering about helping noobs in a way under lvl area :D
I Love it</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="530122">The best 2012 anime, and a masterpiece. As simple as that.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="151823">It`s one of the best in this year... and one of the best ever in this genre</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="99271">This is one of the best animes I have seen. I`m sure that not just gamers but also people who don`t game can enjoy this! The characters are great, and the visuals are awesome. I wish it would be a bit longer though, it`s one of those animes you never want to end.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="238891">The first half of the anime is really great. It got me hooked quite quickly and it is something different from the regular RPG anime. 
However, I wish I stopped watching after that first half, because in the second half it became rubbish. There is a strong focus on sexual harrassment which was completely unecessary. It went to an extent that I felt was way too extreme to just be part of telling the story. It really ruined it for me. So if don`t like things like that, I would advise you to stop after episode 14 and maybe watch the last episode.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="33154">If they follow the light novels and put it back in chronological order (witch I think they will) then this would be one of the best show of the season as I can`t stop reading the novel already, I can`t wait to see it all in anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="239740">Best anime of the year. Just watch it already! Way better than Accel world.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="658682">The best anime for ever!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="308099">I think most of us here can actually relate to this series since (I think) most of us here at least had played MMORPG at one point. :p
Apart from that, this is actually one of my favourite anime recently because of the storyline and characters + the idea of the game itself. I think the only thing that is quite lack is the depth of each character but its a given since it is only a one season anime. But hopefully though, there`ll be season 2. I watched it twice and still get entertained! :D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="605168">I really enjoyed this anime! Its a great story, heart warming romance and it made me just a bit sad that I cant play this game... If it only stayed a game that is :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="75448">This is THE anime of 2012, good animation, story based on light novels (books), also highly recommended to read them as well, anime will have new feeling then</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="356572">The story lingers in my mind, even several days after having completely watched the series. Seldom that this happens to me. I hope a second series comes out.
It`s a pity that they obviously sped up the story in the anime, about halfway the series, compared to the manga, which I haven`t read (yet).</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="369649">No doubt one of the best shows of 2012, with good characters and storyline. Of course, a lot of detail from the original LNs are missing, but in all, this show is being well executed. I look forward to this every week!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="303237">Give it try , you wont regret it</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="509497">wow!
read all the novels too
this series complements them beautifully
amazing</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="387581">This anime is one of the best out there , and more than that it has an good story and an virtual interface.
Its a must see!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="331999">Sword Art Online is such an amazing light novel that I have read. When I first read it I spent about 16 hours straight reading it. And to be able to watch this light novel that struck my being with such a brutal force in an animation, was truly incredible and satisfying. Even though it felt a little rushed through the arcs and some scenes were skipped I`m sorry to say that I`m given this a 10 and Must See.

Thank you for animating this wonderful piece!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="538195">F*cking awesome!.. Hurry up and watch dont just read this text of mine! ........................................And your still here... *facepalm*</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="522616">Well... I can say that I was a little skeptical about this one when I began to watch it... what a good surprise! First of all, this is a fast passed anime, and thats like GOLD lately, 10 ep and some well developed romance + 4 eps more story development. Maybe I`m just sick of those 12-24 ep animes that are SOOOO slow and with a obviously "kinda" gay and shy main character. Kirito is just... cool. This one is very interesting. Plus, don`t buy that "MMORPG fan" crap...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="139011">A little weak in places but over all a very enjoyable piece of entertainment. Easily went into my top 20 list</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="425228">I`ll probably be repeating the same thing others have said, but this anime is incredible and amazing. Even if you don`t like MMORPGs, you should still watch this. I mean, it is that good! I have not bought any anime in a while, but I will definitely be purchasing this series when it comes out on DVD/Blu-ray. Just watch it; you won`t be disappointed.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="529895">One of the best anime I`ve seen so far. I love the setting, great characters and epic action. Good pace as well. Kinda hard not to go peek ahead in the novels though cause the story is very compelling.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="207162">I never seen anime like this and it`s great everyone that live games and romantic anime must see this !!! Don`t know what to say else just perfect will really hope for season 2 .</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="297053">Definitely a must see. You can not believe how good this is!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="536061">An excellent series, marred by a sub-par second arc. Fascinating and believable setting with lovable characters including a strong female co-star who doesn`t feel like she exists solely as the main character`s victory prize. Unfortunately, the second arc while still pretty good is nowhere near as excellent as the first for multiple reasons. For me, it`s biggest sin though is that it undoes a lot of what makes several characters interesting in the first arc. Those familiar with the series origin know that original story as it was first conceived was intended to end at the conclusion of the first arc, and it very definitely shows.

Still. Highly recommend watching. Despite my dislike of the second arc, the series very quickly ended up in my personal top 5. This is the series you wanted to be watching during .hack

Fair warning, SERIOUS sexual assault trigger warnings involved here.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="413731">if you liked the .Hack game/anime series this is a must watch show, I loved it</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="495005">Those of you Gamers that have ever dreamed about being stuck in an actual MMORPG then this show is a must. And those of you who want a good show to watch, then you picked a good one. Though the love story is kinda sporadic, the gameplay and the logic is accurate. You will cry, you will laugh and you will rage while watching this show. This is definitely a show to watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="527292">For all those who recommended this as a must see i applaud u all it is truely amazing and cant wait for more... best anime ive seen this year.</recommendation>

<name>sword</name>
<description>A sword is a long, edged piece of metal, used as a cutting, thrusting, and clubbing weapon in many civilizations throughout the world. Before firearms became commonplace, and fast enough to render other weapons pointless in the battlefield, they were the main kind of weapon for war and duels alike. A sword fundamentally consists of a blade and a hilt, typically with one or two edges for striking and cutting, and a point for thrusting. That aside, however, they may come in all sorts of designs: the medieval European swords used to be big, heavy weapons that did not actually cut but instead broke the enemy`s bones under their armor; conversely, the Chinese jian sword (called "ken" in Japanese) attempted to exploit the armor`s joints and perforate the enemy`s flesh in those places, but was useless against the armor itself, and did not take the strikes, preferring to redirect them, to this day being considered a highly "circular" weapon and associated to taijiquan; on the other hand, the Japanese katana was a balanced all-purposes weapon that could be used even in an axe-like way, but which a master swordsman could use in many other, more elaborate manners.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>violent retribution for accidental infringement</name>
<description>A comedy / slapstick element often found in Ecchi anime: The hilarity derives from spontaneous embarrassment, overreaction of the "victim" (girl), immediate retribution for a seemingly inappropriate act, and a sense of pity with the supposed "aggressor" (boy).
Typically a boy will - through no fault of his own - stumble into a girl, thus invading her personal space. In the process the boy may e.g. pull down her skirt, grab the girl`s breasts, or accidentally kiss her. Any level-headed girl would see the accident just for what it is. Not so the girl with an overly developed sense of modesty, and a thing for violence. She - often a tsundere - will clobber the boy with excessive brutality.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

Most of the surviving mythology centres on the plights of the gods and their interaction with various other beings, such as humanity and the jötnar, beings who may be friends, lovers, foes and/or family members of the gods.

<name>isekai</name>
<description>An isekai story is one in which the lead characters are transferred to and become stuck or trapped in another world, one completely different from the one they lived in up until the transfer. The new world is commonly a http://anidb.net/t2628 [fictional world], such as a http://anidb.net/t2838 [parallel world] or http://anidb.net/t2839 [virtual world] (other fictional world types can also apply). What defines the isekai genre is that the characters are sent to another world, often but not always a parallel one, and they generally cannot come back permanently without meeting a highly specific goal.
In order to adapt to their new environment, they must use the abilities and knowledge brought from their former world as well as any that may have been bestowed upon them by their brave new world. In some cases, they will seek and eventually find a way to return; in others, they will gleefully embrace their new life.
http://anidb.net/a144 [Inuyasha] is an example where isekai applies to a fictional world that is not also a parallel or virtual world. http://anidb.net/ch7246 [Higurashi Kagome] climbs down an ancient well at her grandfather`s shrine and is transported to feudal Japan (time travel). While she eventually gains the physical ability to travel back and forth between her time period and feudal Japan, her bonds and responsibilities to feudal Japan tie her there until they are ultimately resolved.
For clarity, below is an illustrative example where isekai is applied to a non-fictional, non-parallel, non-virtual world.

* The main characters are from Earth. One day, they are abducted by Nazis from Mars (alternate "world") are brought back to their Martian base. The main characters are trapped on Mars. Their only escape is to defeat the Nazis and steal their spaceship to return to Earth (specific goal required to escape); they are left to thier own devices, with no prospect of help from Earth, and no way to contact Earth.

<description>The main protagonist of the series. He is the protagonist and is a "solo" player, a player who hasn`t joined a guild and usually works alone. When it is announced that the players of Sword Art Online can no longer logout, he is surprised like everyone else, but unlike everyone else he quickly gets over it and accepts it, to an extent. He mainly uses a one-handed sword and usually wears all black in game, as it adds to stealth. He can also use two blades at once, a unique skill to him and he only uses it in emergencies to avoid attention for being one out of the two people to have unique skills. His game alias is Kirito, which is created by taking the syllables of the first and last Kanji of his real last and first names respectively: (Kirigaya Kazuto). In the real world, he lives with his mother and younger sister in a family of 3.</description>

<description>Originally a side story character in SAO, Yui later becomes an accompanying/support character in ALO. At first thought to be a lost child in SAO, she is actually an artificial intelligence program. Her full designation is «Mental Health - Counselling Program», MHCP version 1, codename, «Yui». She was designed to monitor the emotions of players and appear at their sides to hear and help them out. However, since the moment everyone was imprisoned in Sword Art Online, she was forbidden to come in contact with the players and complete her prime directive. Unable to do anything but suffer as she monitored the emotions of the trapped players, she came upon Kirito and Asuna whose emotions stood out as a beacon of joy and peace in a sea of fear and despair. She sought them out, appearing to them as an amnesia child whom they adopted. In the end she was nearly deleted by Cardinal, the management system of SAO. But Kirito saved her by converting and storing her data into his own Nerve Gear. Yui later shows up in ALO as a Private Navigation Pixie and helps Kirito along with Leafa to find Asuna. She refers to Kirito as "Papa" and Asuna as "Mama" and gets very annoyed if any girl other than Shinon, Leafa or Asuna gets close to Kirito.

Later, it is discovered that he has been masquerading as Heathcliff, the leader of the Knights of the Blood Oath. Although he has the admin powers to make his avatar immortal, he is shown to be a powerful player even without his in-game immortality due to his intimate understanding of the SAO game mechanics which he himself had designed. He is defeated by Kirito at the end SAO arc, and at the end of ALO arc, leaves behind a program that grants Kirito the World Seed. His death was his own doing since he had also rigged his own Nerve Gear device to fry his brain when he was defeated and transferring his soul into a digital form.

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Nobuyuki Sugou is the main antagonist of the Alfheim Online arc. He is the one responsible for keeping 300 Nerve Gear victims, including Asuna, prisoner even after SAO had ended. He did this by transferring them all into ALO for experiments on human subjugation via fulldive technology. He also attempts to take over RCT Progress Inc. by marrying Asuna while she is unconscious. He displays a perverse interest in consummating this marriage while Asuna is still comatose. In ALO, he takes on the identity of Oberon the Fairy King and makes Asuna his queen, Titania. When he and Kirito finally meet, he flaunts his GM status as well as the results of his research by causing Kirito immense amounts of pain after increasing Kirito`s pain limit and impaling him. He is defeated when the "Ghost Program" of Akihiko Kayaba reminded Kirito how he was defeated by Kirito`s determination, before aiding him in overcoming Nobuyuki`s GM status. All 300 victims are released from ALO, but Nobuyuki makes another attempt to attack Kirito while he is making his way to Asuna in the real world. However, he is once again subdued by Kirito, who puts the unarmed combat skills he had learned in SAO to useful effect. Nobuyuki is then arrested and charged for his crimes.

<summary>The VRMMORPG, Sword Art Online (SAO), is officially released, with 10,000 copies released and sold immediately. Kirito, who beta-tested the game, logs-in to the world of Aincrad and meets Klein, a new player, who asks him to teach him the basics of the game including the Sword Skill battle system. Later, after several hours in the game, Kirito and Klein discover that they cannot "log-out". Shortly after, the pair are teleported to the town square, where they see that all other players have also been transported to the location. A red-hooded Game Master then appears in the sky and reveals himself to the crowd as Akihiko Kayaba, the game`s creator. He tells them that he intentionally removed the log-out option. He cautions that they cannot log-out by simply removing the NerveGear, the VR helmet they use to log-in the game, as it will kill them instantly. The only way to log out is for the players to beat and clear all 100 floors of the game. Should they die in the game, their real bodies will perish as well. As a parting gift, Akihiko gives them a mirror that alters their in-game avatars to resemble their real appearance. Kirito asks Klein to follow him to the next town to level up before resources are depleted, but Klein politely declines as he wishes to remain with his friends. Kirito then heads out, vowing to be free from the game. By the end of the first month, 2,000 players have died and the 1st floor has yet to be cleared.

The next day, as they make their way to the Hill of Memories, Kirito tells Silica about his younger sister, whom he was very close to and Silica reminds him of. As they finally retrieve the item, the Pneuma Flower, they are confronted by Rosalia and her men, who are actually part of the Titan`s Hand, a notorious orange player guild and are after the flower.

<summary>Four months have passed with more powerful players and guilds clearing the game`s floors. After saving a guild called the Moonlit Black Cats, their leader, Keita, thanks Kirito and asks him to join their guild. Kirito accepts the invitation, but hides the fact that he is Level 40, twice the average level of the guild. Kirito bonds with his new friends, especially Sachi, who confides in Kirito that she is afraid to die. Kirito assures her that he will protect her and that they will be free one day. On June 12, 2023, while Keita goes to buy a house for the guild, the Black Cats decide to earn some money by going to the upper floor dungeons, but get trapped in a room with higher level Mobs. Kirito desperately tries to save his friends but they are killed, including Sachi. Thinking that he is responsible for his friends` deaths, including Keita`s, who committed suicide upon learning what happened, Kirito displays increasingly reckless tendencies and goes on a dangerous quest to obtain an item that revives the dead. On December 24, 2023, Argo the informant tells Kirito of the existence of a special boss named Nicholas the Renegade, which drops the item. As Kirito travels to the boss, he is followed by Klein and his guild Fuurinkazan, concerned with Kirito`s safety. They are then surrounded by the Divine Dragon Alliance guild who are also seeking the item. Klein and his guild hold off the Divine Dragons, while Kirito goes off to face Nicholas alone. He emerges victorious, however to his despair, Kirito discovers that the boss item can only revive the dead within ten seconds of the person`s death. When Kirito returns to his room, he receives a farewell message from Sachi which she had recorded before her death to be delivered on Christmas Eve. In the message, Sachi asks Kirito not to blame himself over her death and that he should continue living to the end of the game. As she ends the message by humming "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer", Kirito cries.

<summary>Kirito attends a meeting organized by an idealistic Diabel, who announces to the attendants that his party has found the boss of the 1st floor tower. He rallies everyone to team up and beat the boss, Illfang the Kobold Lord, which will open up the 2nd floor. Parties are formed and Kirito teams up with a girl named Asuna. A new player named Kibaou blames the Beta Testers of the game for running away to loot and level up while leaving the new players behind. Another player named Agil defends the Beta players, revealing it was they who gave them the free guide book that helped them survive the game. Using the guide book, Diabel devises a strategy for fighting Illfang and his minions. Later that night, Kirito shares his food with Asuna while she tells him that she joined them because she felt compelled to do something rather than nothing. The next day, Diabel`s raid group arrives at the boss`s room and battles Illfang and his minions. When Illfang`s HP becomes low, Diabel goes for the finishing blow. Kirito tries to warn him after noticing Illfang has a different type of weapon from the one described in the guide book, but Illfang strikes down Diabel. Kirito realizes that Diabel was also a Beta player as he had attempted to obtain the boss`s rare item. As he dies, Diabel begs Kirito to defeat the boss and save the players. Having an epiphany on how Diabel was helping the other players while Kirito had only helped himself, Kirito experiences a renewed determination to defeat the boss. With Asuna and the raid group`s help, Kirito kills Illfang, clearing the 1st floor much to everyone`s joy. However, the celebration ends when Kibaou blames Kirito for Diabel`s death, as his knowledge as a beta player might have saved Diabel. Fearing continued fighting between the beta and new players, Kirito mocks everyone, telling them he is unlike the beta players who were clueless about the game, as he obtained far more knowledge of the Beta test than any other player. Everyone is repulsed by Kirito, and brand him a Beater -- a Beta player who cheats. As Kirito leaves for the 2nd floor, he advises Asuna to join a guild.

<summary>After adventuring on the 74th floor, Kirito finds a Ragout Rabbit, a rare S-class animal with top grade meat. Since he cannot cook well, Kirito decides to sell it to Egil, but he changes his mind when Asuna arrives and tells them she has mastered her cooking skills. Instead, Kirito requests her to cook it in exchange for a share of the meal. However, Kuradeel, Asuna`s escort sent by the Knights of Blood, is against Asuna inviting Kirito to her home as he is a Beater, but Asuna ignores him. At her home in Selmburg on the 61st floor, Asuna cooks the rabbit meat for dinner. Over the meal, Asuna and Kirito discuss the two years that have passed since they were trapped in the game and how so many players have gotten accustomed to living in Aincrad, with fewer than five hundred players clearing the floors. Both agree to party up and explore the dungeons in the 74th floor, and meet up the following day. However, Kuradeel appears and attempts to stop them. Kuradeel challenges Kirito to a duel, promising to leave them alone if Kirito wins. Kirito defeats Kuradeel by breaking his sword. However, Kuradeel refuses to give up, until Asuna relieves him of his duties and orders him to return to Knights of the Blood headquarters. As Kirito and Asuna explore the 74th floor dungeons, they discover the boss room and its boss, Gleam Eyes.

<summary>On 48th floor, Asuna visits her friend, Lisbeth or "Liz", at her smith shop before going off adventuring, and Liz suspects that she was going away with a boy she likes. The next day, Kirito arrives at Liz`s shop in search of a custom-made sword to buy. Much to Liz`s shock, Kirito`s sword, Elucidator, easily breaks her strongest sword. Angry and her pride hurt, Liz persuades Kirito to let her accompany him to the Western Mountain on the 55th floor to get a rare mineral from a dragon that eats crystals, so that she can use the mineral to make a stronger sword. When they arrive at the Western Mountain, Kirito tells Liz to hide when he fights the dragon. However, she ignores his advice and emerges from hiding halfway through the battle, believing the dragon almost defeated. The dragon blasts her into a deep pit with a powerful gale, and Kirito jumps in to save her. Despite surviving the fall, the pair cannot find a way out of the pit and are forced to sleep there for the night. Liz asks Kirito to hold her hand while they sleep, which brings her to the realization that she has feelings for him. The next morning, Kirito discovers that the mineral they are seeking, a Crystallite Ingot, is under the snow as the hole is the dragon`s nest. The dragon returns and Kirito grabs Liz with him as he stabs the dragon`s back, forcing it to carry them out the hole before jumping out. Now safe with the mineral, Liz creates a new sword, Dark Repulsor, for Kirito and denies payment. She instead asks Kirito to make her his exclusive smith and is about to confess her feelings to him, when a worried Asuna suddenly arrives. Realizing Kirito is the boy Asuna likes all along, Liz abruptly excuses herself from them. As Liz cries over her heartbreak, Kirito finds her and tries to comfort her. Accepting that her feelings would go unrequited, Liz pledges her support to Kirito as his smith if he promises to win the game and free them all.

<summary>Kirito pursues the assassin, who escapes by using a teleport crystal. Kirito wonders how it is possible to kill someone in a safe zone to which a paranoid Schmitt declares that the killer is Griselda`s ghost. After watching a dropped sandwich vanish and talking to Asuna about the game`s marriage system of inventory sharing, Kirito deduces how Yolko and Kains "died" and who was Griselda`s murderer. He explains to Asuna that Yolko and Kains are actually alive, and that they had merely faked their deaths by using a teleport crystal when their armor broke from the damage over time weapon effect to give the appearance of a player death. Yolko and Kains confront Schmitt at Griselda`s grave to investigate the identity of Griselda`s killer. After Schmitt explains that he had only followed instructions given to him and had not expected Griselda`s death, the three are surrounded by members of the notorious player-killing guild, Laughing Coffin, who have come to kill them. Yolko, Kains and Schmit are rescued by the timely arrival of Kirito, who intimidates the Laughing Coffin into retreating. Asuna arrives with the man who hires the Laughing Coffin and Griselda`s killer, Grimlock. Grimlock reveals that he is the assassin of Griselda, who is also his wife in the real world, because he is unable to accept that his kind, dutiful wife he loves has become a fearless, independent leader. Asuna admonishes Grimlock for Griselda`s death, telling him that he has never truly loved his wife and that he has been merely possessive. After Yolko, Kains and Schmitt capture Grimlock, Kirito and Asuna briefly discuss about marriage and Kirito states he would love his partner more after seeing a different side of her. Kirito and Asuna then see an apparition of Griselda thanking them.

<summary>During a meeting between guilds on the 56th floor, Asuna, who has become Vice Commander of the Knights of the Blood guild, proposes a plan to lure a boss they are fighting into a village and is opposed by Kirito, as the NPC villagers will be killed. A month later on the 59th floor, Kirito is taking a nap until Asuna arrives and chastises him for being lazy, but Kirito persuades her to relax as well. To repay him for guarding her while she napped, Asuna offers to buy dinner for him at a town on the 57th floor. However, their meal is interrupted by a scream, and they rush out of the restaurant to find a player, Kains, hanging outside a church, impaled with a spear. He dies immediately after. As they investigate the murder, Kirito wonders how Kains was killed in a safe zone, speculating that either the victim was dueled by another player or that someone had found a new exploit to kill players. Yolko, a friend of Kains, mentions someone may have been spotted behind Kains as he was impaled. Asuna and Kirito travel to Egil`s shop to learn more about the murder weapon. Egil tells them that the weapon (Guilty Thorn) is a custom made weapon by a blacksmith named Grimrock. After informing Yolko of their discovery, she explains to them how she and Kains are related to Grimlock. Six months earlier, Yolko, Kains, and Grimlock were part of an eight-man guild called the Golden Apple, led by Griselda, Grimlock`s ingame wife. One day, the guild acquires a rare ring and votes whether to use it or sell it. Three members, Yolko, Kains and Schmitt, now a member of the Divine Dragon Alliance, vote to use it, but the other five vote to sell it. Griselda goes out to sell the ring and is killed. Yolko believes Kains`s killer is targeting the three of them for going against Griselda`s wishes. However, Schmitt fears that the identity of the killer is Griselda`s ghost, who wants revenge against them. Yolko is then killed by a dagger thrown from the window.

<summary>Kirito, Asuna and Yui are resting at the church where Sasha takes care of the younger children, until Yulier, second-in-command from the Army, suddenly arrives. Yulier explains that the Army under their leader, Sinker, had good intentions of helping players but as the Army grew bigger, unscrupulous leaders within the Army began abusing their powers. Sinker was going to expel Kibaou over the Gleam Eyes incident, but the latter trapped him in a secret dungeon beneath 1st floor. Yulier then asks Kirito and Asuna for help in a rescue. The couple accept and, upon arrival at Sinker`s location in the dungeon, get attacked by a boss called "the Fatal Scythe". Kirito and Asuna tell Yulier to escape together with sinker and Yui as they fight the boss, but it is too strong. As the boss is about to strike down Kirito, Yui jumps in between them. The boss attacks, but the boss is unable to damage her due to her being an "Immortal Object". Yui then promptly defeats the boss. After the battle, Yui tells Kirito and Asuna that she has finally regained her memories. She explains that she is an AI counselor created by the game`s Cardinal system, whose purpose was to monitor and counsel the players on their mental state. On the day of game`s launch, Cardinal refused to allow her to interact with the players, and she was forced to watch their mental states deteriorate. Sometime after, Yui learned about the happiness of Asuna and Kirito and thus made an appearance in the 22nd floor forest to meet them. Despite the revelation, Asuna and Kirito still accept Yui as their "daughter", but Yui bids them farewell when she realises that she is to be deleted for her interference in the game. Refusing to accept her deletion, Kirito uses the GM console Yui left behind to save Yui`s data by turning her into a game item. With the data saved on his NerveGear local memory, Kirito and Asuna hope to recreate her in the real world.

<summary>Kirito and Asuna go on vacation and stay at their new home in a secluded village in the 22nd floor. The couple later find a lost girl in the forest and see her suddenly collapse. As they approach the unconscious girl, they discover that she does not have a cursor above her, suggesting a glitch. They take the girl to their home. She wakes up the following day, but upon questioning from Asuna and Kirito, it is discovered that the girl cannot remember anything but her name, Yui. Yui, unable to pronounce Asuna and Kirito`s name correctly, calls them "mama" and "papa" instead. Believing that she got separated from her family, Kirito and Asuna decide to head to the Town of Beginnings on the 1st floor to find Yui`s relatives before they go back to the front lines. Instead, they find a young woman named Sasha and the children she`s taking care of being extorted by the Army for taxes. Asuna attacks their leader, scaring him and the rest of the Army soldiers away. As Sasha and the children thank Asuna, Yui reaches towards the sky and repeats "Everyone`s hearts..." several times. Asuna rushes over to ask Yui if she has remembered anything, and she tells Kirito and Asuna that she realizes she has never been to the Town of Beginnings before. Suddenly, Yui`s eyes widen, and mysterious static sound affects everyone before Yui faints.

<summary>The duel between Kirito and Heathcliff is held at an arena where a large crowd has gathered. Asuna warns Kirito to be careful about fighting Heathcliff as he has a unique skill called Holy Blade, which grants him maximum strength and defense. Heathcliff initially overpowers Kirito but the tide turns when Kirito forces Heathcliff on the defensive. Just as Kirito is about to deal the winning strike, Heathcliff mysteriously manages to dodge it and defeats Kirito. Now a member of the Knights of Blood, Kirito is questioned by Asuna about the reason for his strong aversion to joining guilds. After he confides in her about what happened to his old guild, Asuna comforts Kirito and tells him she will protect him. Later, Kirito is asked by fellow member Godfree to follow him and a seemingly remorseful Kuradeel to the 55th floor dungeons for a skill assessment. As they stop for a break, Kirito notices too late that the water he and Godfrey drank contains a paralysis effect. Kuradeel then reveals he is a member of the Laughing Coffin and his intentions to kill both Godfree and Kirito, while making it look like they were victims of an ambush. After finishing off Godfree, Kuradeel attempts to kill Kirito, but the latter is saved by the arrival of Asuna who tracked them on her map. Furious, Asuna quickly whittles down Kuradeel`s HP until the critical stages. Kuradeel begs Asuna for forgiveness, which was a ruse to get her guard down and disarm her. Just as Kuradeel is about to strike Asuna, Kirito jumps in between them, blocking the attack with his arm before killing him. Asuna feels guilty for what had happened, but Kirito kisses her, and tells her how much he cares about her and how he wants to protect her. They stay at her home for the night. Later, as he sits next to Asuna on her bed, Kirito asks her they should take a temporary leave from the guild tells her of a place where they can be alone together and then proposes to her, which she tearfully accepts.

<summary>Kirito and Asuna flee from the boss room to another part of the dungeon, where they stop for a meal and encounter Klein and the Furinkazan guild. The Aincrad Liberation Force guild, known as "The Army", also appears, visibly exhausted from exploring the floor. As the soldiers rest, their leader Corbatz demands Kirito to give them the map he made of the floor. Despite Asuna and Klein`s protests, Kirito complies with his request. Kirito, Asuna, Klein and his guild later check up on Corbatz and his men, only to learn that they are battling Gleam Eyes by themselves, despite Kirito`s earlier warnings. To make matters worse, the teleport crystals do not work in the boss room. As the members of the Army are killed off one by one, Asuna, Kirito and Klein charge at the boss to protect the survivors. Not wanting to see more people die, Kirito is forced to use a unique skill, Dual Wield, he has been keeping secret that allows him to fight with two swords. Using both Elucidator and Dark Repulsor, Kirito performs Star-burst Stream, a barrage of deadly slashes to defeat Gleam Eyes, before falling unconscious as his HP hits red. Upon awakening, Kirito is greeted by the sight of a distraught Asuna, who announces her intentions to take a break from her guild and continue partying with Kirito. Shortly after the boss battle, Kirito`s unique skill becomes the talk of Aincrad, which gets him the attention of Heathcliff, the Commander of the Knights of Blood. Not wishing to see his vice-commander leave his guild, Heathcliff challenges Kirito to a duel. If Kirito wins, Asuna is allowed to leave the guild and join his side, but if he loses, Kirito must join the Knights of Blood. Kirito agrees to the terms and accepts Heathcliff`s challenge.

<summary>While fishing near a lake, Kirito encounters Nishida, an old man and former network security manager for Argus, the company that made SAO, who oversaw the game`s development. He remarks that despite honing his fisherman skill, he is unable to cook delicious dishes with what he catches. Kirito then invites him to his home for Asuna to cook the fish he just caught for them. During their meal, Nishida mentions a huge fish he tried to catch many times but failed, and he asks Kirito to help him. Later, Nishida manages to hook the fish and passes the rod to Kirito to pull it away. The fish is revealed to be a huge monster which Asuna slays. Soon after, Kirito receives a summons from Heathcliff. Kirito and Asuna leave to meet up with him at the Knights of Blood headquarters, where they learn that a scouting party had been trapped and killed in the 75th level`s boss room. A team of players from several guilds, including Kirito and Asuna, is being assembled to fight the boss. Fearing for her safety, Kirito asks Asuna to stay behind, but Asuna refuses, declaring that she would rather die than live without him. She also surmises that all players` real bodies must be currently undergoing treatment in hospitals and that their condition cannot be preserved indefinitely. Therefore, simply fleeing to live by themselves in the game is not an option. Later, when the players enter the boss room, they are confronted by the Skull Reaper, a ferocious, skeletal monster capable of killing players in one blow. Kirito, Asuna and Heathcliff battle the creature head on, while the other players flank it.

<summary>Kazuto visits Andrew, who explains that the screenshot he sent originated from Alfheim Online (ALO), an MMO where players take the role of fairies capable of flight. He explains that the figure resembling Asuna was spotted somewhere on the game`s World Tree. Noticing that RECTO created the game, Kazuto decides to don his NerveGear once again and take up his role as Kirito in ALO. After selecting his character race as a Spriggan and diving in, he enters a strange warphole which leads him to a forest, where he finds to his surprise that his stats are identical to his SAO avatar`s, with the exception of his dual wielding skill. He also discovers that he still has the SAO in-game item containing Yui`s data, which he activates to bring Yui into ALfheim as a Navigation Pixie to their reunion. Yui deduces that the game is made using a copy of SAO`s servers, which was why all common skills and stats from SAO had been carried over to Kirito`s ALO avatar. As Kirito gets used to his flight controls, two Sylph players are being chased by Salamander players. Just as one is defeated and the other named Leafa outnumbered, Kirito crash lands before her and steps in to help defeat the assailants.

<summary>Two months after being freed from SAO, Kazuto`s sister, Suguha, has been constantly worrying about him. The pair have a kendo spar, and though Kirito loses, Suguha is both shocked and curious about his unusual yet proficient sword fighting skills as a result of his time in SAO. Later, Kazuto goes to the hospital to visit Asuna who, along with 300 other players, has yet to wake up even after the SAO incident. It is there that he meets an associate of Asuna`s father, Sugou Nobuyuki. Much to Kazuto`s fury, Sugou tells him that he intends to be adopted into Asuna`s family while she is still comatose as a precursor to marriage. Claiming that this is his right since it was his company, RECTO Progress Inc., had been keeping Asuna alive after SAO`s developer Argus went bankrupt, he informs Kazuto that the ceremony will occur in a week and tells him not to see her again. Later at home, Kazuto breaks down before Suguha, who tells him not to give up, despite knowing Kazuto is actually her cousin and harboring her own feelings for him. The next morning, Kazuto receives an e-mail from Andrew Gilbert Mills, Egil`s real life persona, with a screenshot of an avatar resembling Asuna from another game.

<summary>After the group defeats the Skull Reaper, suffering 14 casualties in the battle, Kirito deduces that Heathcliff is, in fact, Kayaba Akihiko himself, when exposing him as an "Immortal Object". Akihiko paralyses everyone except Kirito, and he then offers Kirito the chance to face him in a one-on-one duel where, should Kirito win, Akihiko would log out all the remaining players. After giving his best wishes to the others, Kirito accepts the challenge but is unable to overcome Akihiko`s absolute defense and intimate understanding of the game`s mechanics. As Akihiko readies the finishing blow, Asuna overcomes her paralysis and takes the hit instead, losing all her HP and disappearing as a result. Distraught by Asuna`s death, Kirito loses the will to fight and receives a fatal stab from Akihiko. However, at the point of death, Kirito remembers Asuna`s belief in him and re-materializes to defeat Akihiko using Asuna`s sword. They are both killed simultaneously and the game is declared cleared on November 7, 2024. Kirito then awakens high above the game world, where he finds both Asuna and Akihiko. Akihiko informs Kirito and Asuna that he has logged out all the other players as promised, and he also explains his motives for creating Sword Art Online before disappearing. Kirito and Asuna then tell one another their real names, Kirigaya Kazuto and Yuuki Asuna, and embrace each other as the world falls apart. To his surprise, Kazuto awakens in a hospital in the real world and, despite being physically weak, he sets off to search for the real Asuna.

<summary>Kirito and Leafa reach the meeting place just as the Salamanders prepare to attack the Sylphs and Cait Siths. Seeing that they have no chance against them in a direct confrontation, Kirito rushes forward and addresses the Salamander General Eugene. Kirito bluffs that he is an ambassador for the Spriggans-Undines alliance, and cautions him that to attack them would be tantamount to declaring war on the other four factions. Eugene does not believe him and challenges him to a duel. Though both are equally skilled, Kirito is severely disadvantaged by Eugene`s superior sword, which can phase ethereally and bypass his defenses. Kirito conjures a huge smokescreen, making use of it to borrow Leafa`s sword and attack from Eugene`s blind spot. Drawing his second sword to block Eugene`s attack at the last instant is enough to surprise him, and Kirito proceeds to win the duel. After Eugene is defeated, he is revived by Sakuya, and leaves in peace with his army. Now exposed as a traitor, Sigurd is contacted by Sakuya who strips him of his title and has him banished from the Sylph territory. After learning that the now allied Sylphs and Cait Siths plan an expedition to the World Tree in a couple of days, Kirito donates a large sum of money to Alicia, leader of the Cait Siths, to aid them in their war effort and departs ahead with Leafa. Meanwhile, Asuna makes use of the code she had previously learned to open the cage and escape.

<summary>While passing through a cave, Leafa receives a message from Recon cautioning her to take care. She and Kirito then realize that they are being followed and try to escape, only to be cornered by a large group of Salamander players. Kirito asks Leafa to support him with her magic while he fights the group by himself. However, he is unable to break their formation until Yui comes up with a plan to have Leafa cast some protective magic on Kirito, while he conjures a spell that temporarily transforms him into Gleam Eyes. In his new form, Kirito obliterates his enemies, but spares one whom Kirito bribes in exchange for information. The Salamander player reveals that his party was ordered to attack Kirito and Leafa by the same group which attacked them during their first encounter. After arriving at the next town, Suguha logs out for a while and answers a phone call from Shin`ichi. Shin`ichi tells her that Sigurd is in cahoots with the Salamanders, who plan on attacking the Sylph leader Sakuya and the Cait Siths during a meeting to establish an alliance. Upon returning to the game, Leafa explains the situation to Kirito and states that it would be in his best interest to continue without her, as allying with the Salamanders may be the best option for him in order to reach the top of the World Tree. Kirito instead chooses to help her and makes use of his speed to break out of the cave with her.

<summary>Suguha reminisces about how she started VR gaming, and then meets up with Recon`s real life persona, Nagata Shin`ichi. She informs him that she will be leaving their party to join Kirito. Later, she logs in as Leafa and accompanies Kirito to shop for new equipment, but runs into her party. The group is led by Sigurd who does not take kindly to Leafa`s departure and warns them they will be consider renegades for not sticking their allegiance to their race`s territories. Before Kirito and Leafa set off, Recon approaches them, saying that though he wants to join them, he will remain in the party to keep an eye on Sigurd due to some suspicions he has on him. Later during their travels, Kirito and Leafa arrive at a landing point where they take turns logging out to refresh themselves. After Kirito returns, they both set off again, unaware that they are being followed by a mysterious group. Meanwhile, Asuna learns from Oberon that Kirito is still alive and secretly obtains the keycode for her cage`s lock.

Leafa and Kirito go to an inn and have a conversation about how he can get to the top of the World Tree. Seeing Kirito`s determination to reach the top of the tree, Leafa decides to help him and asks him to meet her at the inn the next day. When Leafa logs out, it is revealed she is actually Suguha. Meanwhile, Asuna is seen in a gigantic bird cage at the World Tree, held by the game master, Oberon the Fairy King. She recognizes Oberon as Sugou, who insists on calling her "Titania". He reveals to Asuna how he captured the minds of 300 players before they were logged out from SAO including her own, as part of his research on memory control. He threatens to alter Asuna`s memories if she does not cooperate with him and then departs, leaving Asuna in despair and quietly begging for Kirito to save her.

<summary>Rushing to the hospital, Kazuto is attacked by an injured Sugou with a knife at the parking area. Kazuto disarms him, and after considering everything Sugou has done, Kazuto spares his life. Kazuto finally meets with Asuna where they have a tearful reunion. On May 16, 2025, Kazuto and Asuna have returned to school, attending a special school for students who were trapped in SAO. As they have lunch, Kazuto reveals Sugou was captured by the police after their fight and his crimes were exposed by one of his employees. The 300 players that were trapped by Sugou were released but his experiments shocked the public. Asuna`s father and his higher ups resigned and shut down ALO with other VRMMORPG following it as a result of the scandal. Later, Asuna, Kazuto and Suguha head to Andrew`s bar along with Liz/Shinozaki Rika, Silica/Ayano Keiko, Yolko, Kains, Sasha, Yulier, Sinker, Klein/Tsuboi Ryoutarou and his guild where they have a party to celebrate for clearing the game SAO. Andrew analyzed "The Seed" to be a program that allows anyone with a server to create their own VRMMORPG and transfer players to other VRMMORPG easily. "The Seed" is uploaded to the internet which revives the VRMMORPG genre. Later that night in Alfheim Online, Kirito meets up with Leafa where they share a dance and a heartfelt conversation in the sky. Directly afterwards the new floating castle Aincrad from SAO is brought into Alfheim Online which Kirito then professes his intention to clear all 100 floors of SAO. He is met with their friends from SAO and Alfheim Online flying towards the new Aincrad.

<summary>Arriving at the top of the World Tree, Kirito and Yui finally reunite with Asuna. However, they are suddenly hit by high gravity magic, which forces Yui to retreat, and are confronted by Oberon. As Oberon reveals his plans to control the human mind is almost complete, he chains Asuna up and starts to molest her in front of Kirito, who is stabbed into the ground by him. As Kirito falls into despair, he hears the voice of Akihiko, who encourages him to stand up and fight, realising the pain is nothing compared to the pain of SAO. Using Akihiko`s administrative functions, Kirito removes all of Oberon`s powers and challenges him to a fight with no pain absorption, showing him what true pain is before he finally destroys Oberon. After logging Asuna out to ensure her safety in the real world, Kirito meets with the remnant of Akihiko`s memory, who gives him an item called "The Seed" before leaving. After returning to the real world and giving his thanks to Suguha, Kazuto makes his way to the hospital to reunite with Asuna.

<summary>Kazuto thinks back to the time when he was ten and learned that he was not related with Suguha, which resulted in him becoming detached from his family and increasingly engrossed with online gaming. However, due to his extended period trapped in SAO, he decides to make amends with his family. Wanting to sort things out, Kazuto asks Suguha to meet him in ALO. As Leafa contemplates whether she should stop seeing her brother in-game anymore, she runs into Recon, whose unsuccessful attempt to confess to her cheers her up. Leafa then challenges Kirito to a one-on-one duel, during which they both end up throwing it to apologize to each other. After Kazuto explains he won`t be able to say what he thinks of Suguha until Asuna is rescued, Leafa agrees to help him in his quest, dragging Recon along with her. Kirito once again takes on the guardians, this time with assistance from Leafa and Recon. As the number of guardians keep increasing, Recon uses a self-destruct spell to create a gap for Kirito to get through, but it is filled up all too soon. Just as things look dire, Sakuya and Alicia arrive with their armies to back them up. Using Leafa`s sword, Kirito manages to break through the guardians and reach the top, only to find a system administrator-locked door in his way. Then, using the admin key card Asuna gave them, Yui manages to open the door, teleporting her and Kirito to a new location.

Resolving to get to Asuna`s location, Kirito bids farewell to Leafa and embarks on the Grand Quest himself to reach the top of the tree. Upon entering the dome at the tree`s base, Kirito is faced with hundreds of valiant guardians, which he angrily battles against. Despite his best efforts, Kirito is overwhelmed and runs out of HP. Shortly after, Leafa enters the dome and grabs Kirito`s flame which contains his soul, before successfully escaping to revive him. Leafa tries to talk Kirito out of re-entering the dome alone, but he remains determined. Leafa then hears him speak Asuna`s name, causing her to realize that Kirito is actually Kazuto. Upon discovering one another`s identities, they log out. In the real world, Kazuto then approaches Suguha, who reveals in great anguish that she had fallen in love with both of his identities and how she knew they were not true siblings. Heartbroken, Suguha shuts herself in her room leaving Kazuto outside her door in shock.
