<description>http://anidb.net/ch92921 [Minazuki Kashou], the son of a long line of Japanese confection makers moved out to open his own shop "La Soleil" as a patisserie.
But upon moving out, hidden amongst his things were two of the catgirls, http://anidb.net/ch92919 [Chocola] and http://anidb.net/ch92920 [Vanilla], that the family had been raising. When he tried to send them back, they begged and pleaded until he gave in and now they`ve opened La Soleil together.
With two catgirls who really, REALLY love their master trying their very best and occasionally failing -- a heartful comedy opens for business!

<name>juujin</name>
<description>Kemono, "beast", is a genre of Japanese art and character design that prominently features anthropomorphic animal characters. It is used widely in visual arts, especially drawing and painting, and can be found in many manga, anime, and video game.
Anthropomorphic animal characters in the kemono genre are frequently called juujin, "therianthrope"; the kanji for juujin are also sometimes pronounced kemonobito, "beast-human". While their design differs from artist to artist, they generally employ animal traits considered cute and endearing; most kemono characters retain a fundamentally human personality, however, seldom behaving as the actual animals from which they have been anthropomorphized, and as such they are typically depicted living as humans do.
Juujin leans more on the human-looking side when compared to http://anidb.net/t2857 [anthropomorphism], which leans more on the animal-looking side.

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>maid</name>
<description>A maid is a female employed in domestic service. They usually wear uniforms. Since their nature is to be obedient and serve their goshujin-sama (master), they are one of the most desired types of women in Japan, a dream of every Japanese man, particularly http://anidb.net/t1133 [otaku]. Often seen in so-called Maid Cafes in Akihabara, where male customers can for a little time enjoy the feeling of being served by a woman. The male gender opposite is the butler.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>elements</name>
<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>erotic game</name>
<description>An erotic game (eroge) is a Japanese video or computer game that features erotic content, usually in the form of anime-style artwork. In English, eroge are often called hentai games in keeping with the English slang definition of hentai. This is sometimes shortened to H games. In Japan, eroge are also referred to as 18+ games. Most erotic games are visual novels or dating sims but are not limited to them.
Any anime adaptation of a game that contains (or had a version that contains) adult content (generally sex scenes), regardless of how some fanboys blabber on how "the story in that visual novel was too good to be labelled as porn!", should definitely get this category added under them. This should make it pretty clear as to what is an erotic game and what is not.</description>

<name>visual novel</name>
<description>The two terms are similar yet different, however, the fact that they look and `feel` the same outweighs the technical differences. For clarification, visual novels are considered a sub-genre of adventure games and the term does not cover simulations. While the two genres often share a common visual presentation, dating sims are sometimes considered to be more statistically based than the "choose your own adventure" style of visual novels; basically, the choices you make might change something else than just the story arc (or your next porn pic). Dating sims can involve several technical elements such as a time limit, several statistics such as looks and charm which can be boosted through exercise, or an "attraction meter" which can increase or decrease depending on one`s decisions.</description>

<name>Chocola</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A bright, straightforward catgirl with an almost dog-like love for her master.
Alongside her twin, Vanilla they both share the title of youngest among the Minaduki catgirls. She isn`t well-suited to thinking about complicated things, but makes up for it with pure unbridled friendliness. With energy to spare at all times, she tends to leap into action before fully thinking things through. Despite her clumsy moments, her go-getter attitude earns plenty of love anyway.
Chocola and Vanilla were found as strays on the side of the road by the Minadukis. A few days after being adopted, they became ill due to refusing to eat, but recovered after being taken to a clinic. Chocola fell in love with Kashou at this point as he stayed and comforted them when they were sick.</description>

<description>A reserved-yet-clever catgirl of few words who absolutely loves Chocola.
Alongside her twin, Chocola, they both share the title of youngest among the Minaduki catgirls. Vanilla is prone to being misunderstood when she says too little, but she has remarkable insight and is quite sharp. Her sharp wit and I`ll-do-things-my-way attitude make her Chocola`s complete opposite. However, she remains at once both kind-hearted and, well, catlike.
She loves Chocola both as a sister and in a romantic manner, and sees Kashou as a love rival.

<description>Minazuki Kashou is the protagonist of the Nekopara series and older brother of Shigure.
A patissier at Patisserie Soleil who left his home where his parents ran a Japanese confectionery to pursue his own dream. Applies himself so earnestly and thoroughly that his job and hobbies might as well be one and the same. Yet appealing to his humanity is all too easy, and he can`t help pampering the catgirls.</description>

<description>Kashou`s younger sister, and the catgirls` actual owner. Considerably younger than Kashou, she is still in that active and boisterous phase despite her attachment to him. She has quite the talent for economics and in fact secretly runs her own business. She can`t leave the nest yet, though, so she elects to help Kashou from the shadows, a hidden pillar of support. Not that she doesn`t run wild on occasion, of course.</description>

<description>A free spirit who doesn`t know fear, Azuki is the eldest of the Minaduki catgirls. Azuki never hides her true nature. She isn`t afraid to speak her mind, often with a few uncouth words. Most tasks are a nuisance to her at best, leaving her with little motivation to do them. She is actually quite capable, though, and can do almost anything if put to work (aside from physical labor, anyway). She has a complex about her body type, however—never, ever mention short legs around her.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A prideful, quick-thinking, and often domineering catgirl. She loves having the latest brand-name products, and never purrs for anyone except when she wants something from Shigure. She typically speaks frankly, but remains attentive to the attitudes of those around her. She is, as the saying goes, a scaredy-cat, always turning on every light on the way to the bathroom at night. Out of all of the catgirls, her tongue is the most sensitive to hot things.</description>

<description>A relaxed, constantly-grinning lap catgirl. She is in fact a considerate and astute catgirl, often taking a motherly position among the others.

She`s also by far the most confident in her bust size among the catgirls.</description>

She has a mild complex about having a not-quite-feminine appearance, but her loyalty to her master (Shigure) is worlds beyond any dog`s and her Maine Coon strength is extraordinary. She loves helping people when she can, though this rarely ends well thanks to her poor coordination.</description>
