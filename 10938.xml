<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="119713">Very good Mystery/Suspense show. Definitely for fans of the `guess the traitor` gimmick, though the trope has been done better elsewhere. It being 12 episodes is a nice touch too, as too often these scenarios drag on and come to a dull conclusion.

Rokka has evidently disappointed a few people simply because they didn`t really read into to fine print of what the show actually was, expecting a by-the-numbers fantasy affair. If mindless sword-swinging and demon-slaying is your thing, you`d better look elsewhere, as this show is thoroughly about 7 characters trying to identify the traitor among themselves.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="567190">Rokka no Yuusha starts out as the typical heroic adventure, only to flip its premise on its head by turning into mystery thriller and it`s great. Like any good mystery, all the clues are there to figure it out, but it casts enough doubt on every possible culprit to keep up the suspense throughout its runtime.

The protagonist is what makes the show work though. Unlike most of the cast, he is neither particularly talented nor magically gifted. He has to fight using tricks, tactics and just generally using his brain, which makes it believable when he`s working through clues, trying to find the mole.

It`s very open-ended, though the major arcs are resolved, so don`t expect too much closure, but if you`re looking for a suspenseful, character-driven show, you won`t be disappointed.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="307294">I expected a fantasy series with slight difference.
My expectation were fulfilled until the "who is traitor" session started, which turned out to go until the end. Still it was fun to watch, the action scenes have good quality and I adapted to the series. Some character are quite interesting, even though some lacked introduction and development.
By introducing a new character shortly before the end, I can already see that a future season will not meet my original expectation either. Another season to play "who is traitor" again is boring. 
Epic fantasy fights and development of the relationship of the remaining warriors would be much more interesting to me in a future season. But I guess there won’t be a future season and if, it will be trash or repetitive.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="359893">I was skeptical first, I didn`t want another cliche fantasy anime, although I wouldn`t mind an original one even if it is dark fantasy. But this one is both fantasy and mystery at the same time. Can you discover the fake brave hero among the others like I did? :) Fighting scenes are good too.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="28277">A compelling detective story in the guise of a standard "defeat the evil demon lord" fantasy.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="491503">Don`t mind the avg rating of this anime coz there are shows that have an avg rating that don`t make any sense. Anyways, this show is, for me, a 9/10. This is a great, must see show. This is one of the very few interesting modern anime I`ve seen(show with moe chars). Especially, with the lacking 12 eps. The only downside I can think of right now is it`s too effing short &amp; I can`t think of any more. This show doesn`t suffer from the usual shortening of the story that adapted anime suffer from. The event is well told and the pacing of the story is really good unlike the other short ep shows out there. 

PREDICTABILITY ruins a show for me. Almost all shows give you hints to which way the story will go but this show wouldn`t give you any so it made me want to continue watching it and that`s a big plus for me.

Another downside I`ve thought of is the fleshing out of the characters and as I`ve thought and confirmed that it`s coz of the 12 ep limit that it`s weak by listening to the sp eps</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="112092">I started watching this anime expecting a regular shounen/seinen with heroes going to defeat a demon lord and nothing more, but what I got was something else and suprised me in a good way. With the premise of a traitor being in the group, the whole series turns to a suspense and thriller anime. The fight scenes in this series are also a whole level better than most generic "adventure" animes</recommendation>

<name>detective</name>
<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>adventure</name>
<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>fictional language</name>
<description>Fictional languages are intended to be the languages of a fictional world and are often designed with the intent of giving more depth and an appearance of plausibility to the fictional worlds with which they are associated, and to have their characters communicate in a fashion which is both alien and dislocated.
Some of these languages, e.g. in worlds of fantasy fiction, alternative universes, Earth`s future, or alternate history, are presented as distorted versions or dialects of modern English or other natural language, while others are independently designed conlangs.
A fictional language often has the least amount of grammar and vocabulary possible, and rarely extends beyond the absolutely necessary. At the same time, some others have developed languages in detail for their own sake, such as J. R. R. Tolkien`s Quenya and Sindarin and Star Trek`s Klingon language which exist as functioning, usable languages. Here "fictional" can be a misnomer.</description>

This sometimes leads to the repetition of certain events (like in the "Endless Eight" episodes in Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu (2009)).</description>

<name>rivalry</name>
<description>Quite broadly used term describing a conflict, contest, struggle, or opposition of some sort.
Typical examples: The mostly comedic rivalry for the love of a protagonist in a harem anime (love polygon), the more "mindless" battles between wannabe delinquents in a school fighting anime, or the struggle between good &amp; evil in an epic conflict for world domination.</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<name>3D CG animation</name>
<description>Abbreviation for "three-dimensional computer generated animation" or "computer graphics" (CGI). The traditional 2D art is enhanced by 3D imagery developed through computer modeling software. Done in the right way, this union of 3D in a 2D animated world can be a very beautiful relationship.
The difference lies in what lacks the traditional 2D animation all together and may give term to something produced entirely with 3D graphics (such as the 2006 remake of "Appleseed" , 2007`s "Vexille", the 2008 addition to the "Biohazard" series and the more well known "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within" and "Advent Children").</description>
