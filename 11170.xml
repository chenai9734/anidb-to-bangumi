<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="79717">After reading the manga, this anime feels very inferior to the original source material. They put 2 arcs into a 13 episode anime so a lot of scenes were taken out. It was still a good watch, all of the action scenes were great, but the rest of the scenes were either shortened, cut out, or moved around so it didn`t have a powerful impact as it originally did. If you are a fan or Noragami, I highly recommend picking up the manga too.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="406294">1st season was ok - a good watch. But this 2nd season is far far better in all aspects! I didn`t expect this series to turn out like that. Improvements are obvious everywhere, especially in the story, which was tight, full of action, emotions, cliff-hangers and plot-twists you wouldn`t imagine. The characters became way more interesting and serious, with deep backgrounds and purposes. It was an all-killer-no-filler season that you should definately check out! 9/10.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="386453">As everyone already mentioned: This season is even better than the first one and develops. Though it ends with a real cliffhanger and needs a 3. season ^^</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="558451">Marvellous! I`m already waiting (and hoping) for season 3. A must see, definitely!</recommendation>

<description>In the second season of Noragami the main focus is on Bishamon, god of war. She has many shinki due to her being unable to abandon spirits attacked by Ayakashi. She has a large group of shinki with her as leader, causing her trouble as she sometimes cannot tend to all of them properly, especially when one of them gets sick or is in pain. She has a strong hate for Yato, as a dark past binds the two of them. How will the horrifying events dated hundreds of years ago in combination with current evil happenings affect Yato and Yukine?</description>

<description>The character suffers from some kind of amnesia (memory disturbance or loss). This may mean inability to memorize new information, or inability to recollect old memories. Since there are many types of memory, the person may e.g. forget who they are but still retain learned skills.
Amnesia is fairly common in fiction as a plot device. In fact, because it allows for major plot changes while requiring little creativity from the author, it may be subject to heavy overuse.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<name>exhibitionism</name>
<description>Exhibitionism is the act of exposing in a public or semi-public context the parts of one`s body that are not normally exposed. That may be done to prompt sexual arousal, but many forms of exhibitionism actually mean to create humour or disparagement through shock value or mockery. The idea of exhibitionism is closely tied to the notions of decency and modesty in dressing, and as such is highly dependent on one`s own cultural background. Certain forms of exhibitionism may be considered indecent exposure, and thus in many jurisdictions they may lead to civil or criminal charges. While both deal with the lack of clothing and may in certain cases overlap, exhibitionism is very different from and not to be confused with http://anidb.net/t2304 [nudism].</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>magic circles</name>
<description>A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised.
Traditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for non-magical work such as meditation.
Generally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names.

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>mafia</name>
<description>A mafia is a type of organized crime syndicate whose primary activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions. Secondary activities may be practiced such as gambling, drug trafficking, loan sharking, and fraud. The term was originally applied to the Sicilian mafia, but has since expanded to encompass other organizations of similar methods and purpose, such as in "the Russian mafia" or "the Japanese mafia", and is applied informally by the press and public, but the criminal organizations themselves have their own terms; for example, the original Sicilian and Italian-American mafia call themselves "cosa nostra", while the Japanese mafia calls itself "yakuza".

<name>blackmail</name>
<description>In general usage, blackmail is a crime involving unjustified threats against a person or organization in order to make a gain or harm or cause material loss to them unless a demand is met. It may be considered similar to or a form of extortion, although some jurisdictions will consider them as separate crimes. Most often, blackmail involves the threat of revealing some secret to a given third party, which may be another person, a rival organization, or a state institution such as the police, or to the general public. In anime and related media, and more specifically in pornographic works, blackmail is also a device used to coerce people, generally female and often schoolgirls, into having sex with another or others; in such cases, it may be considered similar to or a form of rape.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top".</description>

In some cases, the term may apply to treatment of dead bodies, such as soldiers mutilated after they have been killed by an enemy. Maiming, or mutilation which involves the loss of, or incapacity to use, a bodily member, is and has been practised by many societies with various cultural and religious significances, and is also a customary form of physical punishment, especially applied on the principle of "an eye for an eye".

<summary>Kazuma and Hiyori have been locked in a dungeon by Kugaha. Hiyori notices that unlike all of Bishamon`s other Shinki, Kazuma`s name does not end in `ha` (巴) but `ma` (麻). All gods add a common character to the names of all their shinki which acts as a clan name, and Kazuma explains that the difference is because he is the only survivor from Bishamon`s previous `ma` clan: all the rest were massacred by Yato centuries ago at his own request, as it was the only way to purge her from a blight that had spread to all the rest of her shinki, but she never learned this truth. Kazuma realises that Kugaha`s plan seems to be that he is conspiring to kill Bishamon, so that when she is reborn he can take Kazuma`s place as her exemplar. He abducted Hiyori in order to goad Yato into killing Bishamon.
Yato, just as Kugaha planned, has realised that Hiyori has been abducted and makes his way with Yukine to the realm of the gods with Tenjin`s assistance. Yato demands that Bishamon release Hiyori, who of course doesn`t know what he is talking about, and the two gods have a great battle, and while for a time it seems they are evenly matched Bishamon`s shinki manage to bind him, and Bishamon manages to break Yukine in his sword form.</summary>

<summary>Despite the inspection that Kazuma ordered, one of Bishamon`s shinki, Aiha, actually is blighted, but this fact has been concealed by Kugaha. Unaware of his treachery, Kazuma asks him to watch over Bishamon while he investigates what has happened to Suzuha. Kugaha makes insinuations to her about how Kazuma has been consorting with Yato.
Yukine, still unaware of Suzuha`s death, visits his tree, and sees Kazuma leaving a bouquet of flowers for him. He chases after him, and winds up entering Bishamon`s realm. Bishamon appears, and Yukine confronts her about Suzuha, telling her of how he had been in pain for so long as it seemed that his master had forgotten him, and accuses her of not truly caring for her shinki. This deeply affects all of her minor shinki, and Kazuma tries to calm Bishamon down, but she accuses him of saving Yato with an ablution ritual, and of secretly being in contact. He does not deny it, but states that Yato is not her enemy but rather her saviour. Bishamon fires on him, but he makes a barrier against his own master. Enraged, she begins to revoke his name, but relents, and banishes him instead.
With nowhere else to go Kazuma stays with Kofuku along with Yato. Yato has a conversation with Hiyori about Yukine and Kazuma as she goes home, and they are attacked by Aiha who has a cursed staff. Hiyori steps out of her body and tries to help, but is abducted by ayakashi under Kugaha`s control while Yato chases Aiha. Kazuma sees what has been done to Hiyori and tries to save her, attempting to bind Kugaha`s name, but this does not work, and he is captured instead along with Hiyori.</summary>

<summary>Yato learns about Suzuha, and that he is supposedly one of Bishamon`s shinki, although he seems to know nothing at all Yato nor his master`s enmity with him, so he permits Yukine to continue being friends with him as long as he is careful. It turns out Suzuha had not been personally called upon by Bishamon in years, and he befriended a human girl named Tomoko a long time ago and she had forgotten about him as she grew older, though he continues to hope that she will someday remember. Suzuha is then murdered by ayakashi under the control of Kugaha, yet another of Bishamon`s shinki, who seems to be secretly working with Nora to destroy Bishamon.
The mysterious death of Suzuha has affected Bishamon, and at one point Kazuma sees that she has signs of being blighted, so he calls all of the shinki and has them inspected by Kugaha, and finds that none of them are contaminated by ayakashi. When she comes down to see what is happening, Kazuma sees that the stain he saw on her has somehow disappeared.
Yukine tries to introduce Suzuha to Yato and Hiyori but finds he is not at his usual cherry tree. Later, Yato, sensing that ayakashi were recently at the tree returns in the evening and runs into Kugaha. Yato demands to know whose shinki he is and they have a brief confrontation before Kugaha escapes on.</summary>

<summary>Yato and Yukine have once again taken on one of their 5-yen jobs, this time to take care of an infant while its mother sleeps. Hiyori comes by to visit in her spirit form. They are attacked by an ayakashi, which seems to be regenerating, and they cause a lot of damage to the house before they realise that its true essence is in the mirror and manage to defeat it.
Meanwhile, Bishamon, disturbed by dreams of the past, orders Kazuma to find Yato, who has been hiding from her. She destroys several ayakashi that are harassing a spirit, and afterwards turns her into a shinki, which takes the form of broken mirror as the spirit was troubled. The large number of shinki she has takes its toll on her.
Yukine meets another shinki named Suzuha while he is out on his own and befriends him. It turns out that he is another one of Bishamon`s shinki.</summary>
