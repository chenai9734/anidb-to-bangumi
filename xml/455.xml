<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="334324">Good Anime, High Tech, Magic, and Demons at the same time. Complex Story and a little confusing sometimes. Story Ends a little short. Animation is much like YuYu Hakusho and PatLabor, lots of details and low CG. So pretty good for a late `90s anime, but not for everyone. Recommend watching the first few Episodes first.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="73514">A classic "mad scientists conspiracy ruined the world" scenario, with mature romance instead of Evangelion`s whiny kids (thus closer to Rahxephon), plus a strong plead for friendship and "all is not lost".
Average art (for its time), mediocre signature episodes for the characters and an horribly incomplete ending are fully compensated by a hyper-complex plot (where every detail is essential so that all pieces fall into their place in the end), a 19 year old female lead wrestling with her doubts and despair in a fantasy scenario (think Juuni Kokuki) and a bombastic-orchestral soundtrack (with the powerful OP song as shining highlight).
Be prepared to read the manga (or the "organizations" part of the character database here) in order to get every last question answered though.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on the manga by http://anidb.net/cr1021 [Asamiya Kia] serialised in Comic Comp and later Comic Dragon.
2023. Beings known as "Lucifer Hawk" have begun invading earth from another dimension. All that stands between them and the enslavement of the human race is the Attacked Mystification Police Department - a special division of the Tokyo Police staffed by women with amazing paranormal abilities. Will the abilities of http://anidb.net/ch13443 [Katsumi] and the AMP be enough to defeat these forces of darkness?</description>

<name>extrasensory perception</name>
<description>Extrasensory perception (ESP), involves reception of information not gained through the recognized physical senses but sensed with the mind. The term was coined by Sir Richard Burton, and adopted by Duke University psychologist J. B. Rhine to denote psychic abilities such as telepathy and clairvoyance, and their trans-temporal operation as precognition or retrocognition. ESP is also sometimes casually referred to as a sixth sense, gut instinct or hunch, which are historical English idioms. The term implies acquisition of information by means external to the basic limiting assumptions of science, such as that organisms can only receive information from the past to the present.
In Japanese usage the term is often misappropriated to refer to any supernatural, non-magical, super power. Users of such powers are called `esper` in Japanese. The term `esper` is not normally in use outside of Japan but is slowly being introduced due to its usage in anime and manga.
In anime/manga the following powers, among others, are described as ESP:
- telepathy
- precognition
- clairvoyance
- retrocognition
- remote viewing
- aura reading
- out-of-body experiences (OBE)
- psychokinesis</description>

<name>cyborg</name>
<description>A cyborg is a cybernetic organism (i.e. an organism that has both artificial and natural systems). The term was coined in 1960 when Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline used it in an article about the advantages of self-regulating human-machine systems in outer space. D. S. Halacy`s Cyborg: Evolution of the Superman in 1965 featured an introduction which spoke of a "new frontier" that was "not merely space, but more profoundly the relationship between `inner space` to `outer space` -a bridge...between mind and matter." The cyborg is often seen today merely as an organism that has enhanced abilities due to technology, but this perhaps oversimplifies the category of feedback.
Fictional cyborgs are portrayed as a synthesis of organic and synthetic parts, and frequently pose the question of difference between human and machine as one concerned with morality, free will, and empathy. Fictional cyborgs may be represented as visibly mechanical (e.g. the Cybermen in the Doctor Who franchise or The Borg from Star Trek); or as almost indistinguishable from humans (e.g. the "Human" Cylons from the re-imagining of Battlestar Galactica). The 1970s television series The Six Million Dollar Man featured one of the most famous fictional cyborgs. Cyborgs in fiction often play up a human contempt for over-dependence on technology, particularly when used for war, and when used in ways that seem to threaten free will. Cyborgs are also often portrayed with physical or mental abilities far exceeding a human counterpart (military forms may have inbuilt weapons, among other things).
Real (as opposed to fictional) cyborgs are more frequently people who use cybernetic technology to repair or overcome the physical and mental constraints of their bodies. While cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals, they can be any kind of organism.

<name>sword</name>
<description>A sword is a long, edged piece of metal, used as a cutting, thrusting, and clubbing weapon in many civilizations throughout the world. Before firearms became commonplace, and fast enough to render other weapons pointless in the battlefield, they were the main kind of weapon for war and duels alike. A sword fundamentally consists of a blade and a hilt, typically with one or two edges for striking and cutting, and a point for thrusting. That aside, however, they may come in all sorts of designs: the medieval European swords used to be big, heavy weapons that did not actually cut but instead broke the enemy`s bones under their armor; conversely, the Chinese jian sword (called "ken" in Japanese) attempted to exploit the armor`s joints and perforate the enemy`s flesh in those places, but was useless against the armor itself, and did not take the strikes, preferring to redirect them, to this day being considered a highly "circular" weapon and associated to taijiquan; on the other hand, the Japanese katana was a balanced all-purposes weapon that could be used even in an axe-like way, but which a master swordsman could use in many other, more elaborate manners.</description>

<description>Teleportation is the transfer of matter from one point to another, possibly a distant one, without application of force, and generally instantly. This contradicts scientific law as we know it, and is therefore nowadays impossible. Sometimes it appears as a paranormal or supernatural ability, and sometimes it is shown in science fiction through technological devices backed up by scientific laws yet to be discovered.</description>

<description>The character suffers from some kind of amnesia (memory disturbance or loss). This may mean inability to memorize new information, or inability to recollect old memories. Since there are many types of memory, the person may e.g. forget who they are but still retain learned skills.
Amnesia is fairly common in fiction as a plot device. In fact, because it allows for major plot changes while requiring little creativity from the author, it may be subject to heavy overuse.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours.

The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>magic circles</name>
<description>A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised.
Traditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for non-magical work such as meditation.
Generally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names.

It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>parallel world</name>
<description>A parallel world, parallel universe, or alternative reality is a self-contained separate reality coexisting with our own. Because "alternative reality" sometimes implies that the reality is a variant of our own, like for example a mirror world, we use the term "parallel world/universe" which is more general, without any connotations implying a relationship (or lack thereof) with our own world/universe (meaning a fictional world can just as well have an alternative reality, it doesn`t need to be our reality). To put it more simply, this category is to show if more than 1 world/universe/reality is present in the anime.
Multiple timelines of the same world/universe/reality are NOT considered parallel worlds. For example, in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate] the cast travels through multiple "World Lines", which are defined as parallel timelines of the same universe had various events occurred with differing outcomes.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>An anime that takes place on future Earth (or it could be an alternative universe) after a major cataclysm has occurred. World War III, an alien invasion, plague, global warming or some other general disaster are common themes to build a post-apocalyptic world upon, where the effects were severe enough that mankind barely survived.
The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologised). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in an agrarian, non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of technology remain. There is a considerable degree of blurring between post-apocalyptic fiction and that which deals with false utopias or dystopian societies.</description>

<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<name>important haircut</name>
<description>When a character cuts off his or her hair, it often symbolizes a rite of passage or bout of character growth. A princess striking out on an adventure, or a new recruit at boot camp, for instance. Hair is something that takes time and effort to grow, so parting with it voluntarily can be a powerful act.
This is particularly a big deal when women get haircuts. Yet in fiction, even an accidental hair slicing can leave a character with a surprisingly even cut.
In many religions (Western Christianity, Ancient Egyptian religion, and others) priests and/or monks cut/shave their hair. Roman Catholic nuns also tend to cut and mantain their hair short under their veils when they enter the nunneries. The cutting of one`s own hair is also a part of Buddhist mythology, specifically something done by Siddhartha himself early on in his path to enlightenment, so anime examples might draw from this as an allusion. There are also some cultures, including Native American and many Asians, where a person would cut his or her hair as an act of grief, disgrace, or even rebellion. In the Confucian tradition, hair (like the rest of your body) is considered a gift from your parents and may not be damaged without a very good reason. Furthermore, prisoners and psychiatric patients commonly have their heads shaved, often to prevent the spread of lice, but sometimes also as a demeaning measure.

<description>The eating of humans, also called man-eating, is the practice of some species to prey on human beings for nourishment. Examples of possible hunters may include Earth animals, alien species, zombies or other undead, and so forth. Eating of humans is not to be confused with http://anidb.net/t3815 [human cannibalism]; the former is about other species eating people, while the latter is about humans eating fellow humans.</description>

Either they`ve been reduced to a spectator in their own body, or their soul has been booted out of their body entirely. Either way, the rest of the cast will soon find he`s not himself.</description>

<name>gore</name>
<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<name>the power of love</name>
<description>The power of love is not only the strongest power known to mankind, it is the strongest power in the universe. The power of love conquers all things. It makes people cry, it makes people laugh, it can make them sing and occasionally it even brings dead people back to life, just so.
More so than the power of friendship, the power of true love gives boundless strength and resolution; by the power of love every hardship can be overcome, every issue can be resolved and it does make people resistant to food poisoning (caused by the bad cooking of their loved ones). Even the big bad evil doesn`t stand a chance against the power of true love and often ends up redeemed.
Even when the power of love is not literally and directly responsible, the scene is often set so that the audience is left with the impression that it was "really responsible".</description>

The basic purpose of the host varies on what the point was for it to have been hijacked in the first place. Sometimes it`s used as a disguise, other times it`s used as a decoy and destraction, even simply being used as a weapon and piece of armor that the possessor uses to cause sheer chaos and destruction, but sometimes... a host can be used for fetish fuel.</description>

Being the child of the most powerful sorcerer of his time, Katsumi Liqueur has outstanding magical abilities as well (that http://anidb.net/ch13444 [Kiddy Phenyl] envies her for) but learns about these abilities only late and has a hard time to cope with her new responsibility.
She joins the http://anidb.net/ch25714 [AMP] during the first episodes of this story and gets real close to her police work instructor http://anidb.net/ch25723 [Robert DeVice]. Her nationality changes from American (she came from Hawaii to Tokyo) to Japanese during the events of the movies.
Her powers can be linked back to some http://anidb.net/ch25718 [Lucifer Hawk] blood in her veins, making her stand between the two warring parties of this story`s main conflict, ultimately leading to a fateful decision of hers.</description>

<description>Saiko Yuki (inspired by manga author http://anidb.net/cr1021 [Asamiya Kia]`s favourite actress http://anidb.net/cr13769 [Saitou Yuki], and also a play on "Psycho Yuki") is the http://anidb.net/ch25714 [AMP]`s mascot, dispatch officer and http://anidb.net/ch13447 [Lebia]`s data processing assistant. Although Yuki sometimes acts a little air-headed (she`s only a teenager), she can show a great deal of courage when needed.
Yuki runs a small coffee shop called http://anidb.net/e12405 [Labyrinth], but it is more a hobby than a business since she is a full-time police officer. However, the lease stipulates that as long as she runs it, she doesn`t have to pay rent.
As child, she was found by http://anidb.net/ch13449 [Rally Cheyenne] in the street crying and was later recruited for her enormous psychic powers. Her ability of precognition qualifies her for being a tactical advisor for other team members in battle. For Yuki`s origin see her childhood version http://anidb.net/ch25799 [Yuki-chan]; her character background in the http://anidb.net/a2638 [second movie] differs from the TV version as in the movie she`s not an AMP member yet when http://anidb.net/ch13443 [Katsumi] meets the AMP for the first time.
She met her love interest, http://anidb.net/ch25803 [Washio Tooru] in 1997 as a result of an encounter with a http://anidb.net/ch25718 [Lucifer Hawk] and a magical coffee mill. Both were 17 at the time and she was 16. They met again after Yuki returned to her own time, 2027; http://anidb.net/ch25804 [Tooru] has waited over thirty years for her, and he turns out to be the landlord for her cafe.</description>

Rally has a younger sister by the name of http://anidb.net/ch25720 [Rosa]. Both siblings are half-http://anidb.net/ch25718 [Lucifer Hawk] which gives them great magical powers, though they are rarely shown. During their childhood they experienced persecution of the `devil`s children`; as a result, the older sibling is often reluctant to use her powers whereas Rosa decided to belong to http://anidb.net/ch25784 [Nemesis], siding with the Lucifer Hawks.
Their parents are most likely dead. http://anidb.net/ch25787 [Lufa Cheyenne] may well have been her mother; in the manga she tells her fellow AMP people that her father (who is never visible in the anime) was from the Lucifer Hawk.</description>

<description>To counter the frequent incidents known as "case of Third Attraction" caused by mystic creatures known as http://anidb.net/ch25718 [Lucifer Hawks], http://anidb.net/ch13449 [Rally Cheyenne] founded the Attacked Mystification Police Department (AMP) in 2023. "Fighting is destructive but women have the power to give birth, thus handing over fate to the next generation", is the core idea of all AMP members being women. "Normal humans can`t become AMP members" - each AMP member has some distinct super-human skill, be that magic or technical enhancements of their bodies.</description>

<description>Lucifer Hawks are demons from another dimension (named "Nemesis" whereas our earth`s dimension is named "Gaia"). They appear in various shapes and sizes, and many of them are shape shifters.
The http://anidb.net/ch25714 [AMP] classifies them in the following categories:
* Category I: Usually humanoid, with abilities similar to those of the most powerful human magicians and at least as intelligent as these. They tend to be talkative and toy with humans.

* Category II: Almost as intelligent as humans, capable of lower magic (such as summoning category III LHs) and fast regeneration. Their appearance is unforeseeable.

* Category III: Lower ranked creatures, hardly more dangerous than animals, often looking like flying snakes or mantas. Normal firearms are fully effective against these beings, and their intelligence is low (they`re compared to insects at one point in the show).

The more powerful Lucifer Hawks are able to take human shape; masses of lower LH can form larger beings and merge with existing objects. Both these facts aren`t known until late in the series and then become important for the course of events.
Lucifer Hawks are genetically compatible to humans, and hybrids of both races do in fact exist, most notably the sisters http://anidb.net/ch13449 [Rally Cheyenne] and http://anidb.net/ch25720 [Rosa Cheyenne]. According to http://anidb.net/ch25762 [Grospoliner]`s statement, http://anidb.net/ch13443 [Katsumi Liqueur] (and probably other sorcerers as well) is distantly blood related to the LH from earlier generations. Thus there exists another
* Category IV: Half-breeds between Lucifer Hawks and humans (no official AMP classification; Rally, Rosa and Katsumi plus perhaps her both parents http://anidb.net/ch25713 [Gigelf Liqueur] and http://anidb.net/ch25730 [Fuyuka Liqueur] are the only known beings of this type, http://anidb.net/ch25712 [Ganossa Maximilian] is human despite his abilities).
Being a massive story spoiler, these hybrid LH intentionally haven`t been added to the "Lucifer Hawks" organization entry here (as the data model doesn`t support "hidden members").</description>

<charactertype id="3">Organization</charactertype>
<description>For centuries the Magicians Guild was operating in disguise in order to protect Earth from evil. In the light of the rapid decay of human society, in the year 1999 they started a last attempt to give humankind a new hope - the "Project Gaia", joining the their magical forces (under the lead of http://anidb.net/ch25713 [Gigelf Liqueur]) with the technical abilities of the famous scientist http://anidb.net/ch25760 [Stefan L. Maverick], the creator of the Cyclotron.
Project Gaia was an attempt to make the two dimensions Gaia (our Earth/universe) and Nemesis (the parallel world of the http://anidb.net/ch25718 [Lucifer Hawks]) have limited contact to "exchange impure molecules" and thus "healing" both worlds. Nemesis agreed to these plans and put http://anidb.net/ch25712 [Ganossa Maximilian] in charge of their side of operations. But the project failed, causing the "Silent Crisis" (with millions of casualties on Earth, including nearly all members of the Magicians Guild).
Ganossa sabotaged the project (the dimension gate was opened only for a small gap but then the Cyclotron as opening mechanism got out of control), and many Lucifer Hawks began wandering around freely on earth, killing and eating humans.
So while attempting to heal the world, Gigelf (by accident) had opened the door for the Lucifer Hawks to our dimension, and only his daughter http://anidb.net/ch13443 [Katsumi Liqueur] (having inherited Gigelf`s magical power) will be able to either fully open or completely close the dimension gate - she`s "the key". But Ganossa is still alive and has his own agenda, concealed even from the King of Nemesis.
24 years later, http://anidb.net/ch13449 [Rally Cheyenne] (being the daughter of a Guild Magician but only a child in the days of the Silent Crisis) formed the http://anidb.net/ch25714 [AMP] with the intention of making up for this failure and continuing the work of the Magicians Guild to protect humankind; nearly all other AMP members (Katsumi as Gigelf`s daughter, http://anidb.net/ch13447 [Lebia] as Stefan L. Maverick`s granddaughter, http://anidb.net/ch13445 [Nami] as http://anidb.net/ch25788 [Razan]`s daughter, http://anidb.net/ch13448 [Mana] as http://anidb.net/ch25782 [Genvara]`s financé, http://anidb.net/ch25715 [Lum Cheng] as http://anidb.net/ch25802 [Avalanche Wong]`s granddaughter) are also closely related to key figures of the project, thus carrying the responsibility for the deeds of their ancestors on their shoulders.</description>

<charactertype id="3">Organization</charactertype>
<description>A scientific project of the http://anidb.net/ch25777 [Tajima] Laboratory, performing generic manipulation of children in order to increase their YLPER (YLEM perception, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ylem) abilities.
The ultimate goal of the project was to creating the "perfect human weapon". Each child specialized in one ability; ultimately these abilities were meant to be transferred to another person by killing its owner. Amongst these children were http://anidb.net/ch25798 [Annie-chan], http://anidb.net/ch25794 [Hiroko-chan] (code name: XRP-8), http://anidb.net/ch25793 [Lisa-chan] (code name: XRP-12), and http://anidb.net/ch25799 [Yuki-chan] (code name: XRP-77) who, being the most talented one, was decided to become the final result of the project. But with Yuki, Lisa and Hiroko having escaped from the laboratory the project was never completed.
12 years later, http://anidb.net/ch25792 [Lisa Emelpha] (Lisa-chan) and http://anidb.net/ch25791 [Yamashita Hiroko] (Hiroko-chan) were both killed by http://anidb.net/ch25716 [Annie] during the events of episode 10, thus Annie gained the abilties of both victims; Annie was then defeated by Yuki at the end of episode 10, causing all of Annie`s abilities to be transferred to http://anidb.net/ch13446 [Saiko Yuki], exactly as Tajima-hakase had intended.
The project was funded by http://anidb.net/ch25804 [Washio Tooru] with the intention of giving humankind an effective weapon against the http://anidb.net/ch25718 [Lucifer Hawks]. By effectively `creating` Saiko Yuki of the http://anidb.net/ch25714 [AMP] this way and putting her into a position where she traveled through time back to the days of http://anidb.net/ch25803 [Washio`s youth] (1997, i. e. 13 years before Yuki-chan was even born), thus making him want to support humankind against the LH in the first place, he created a time travel paradox. But with Yuki being able to teleport the AMP members out of the destruction area during the battle in episode 25, Tooru actually got the result he had planned.
(The Bandai U.S. release for Silent Möbius - as well as the official German sub - mistranslated "YLEM" to "IREM" (going by the audio pattern) during the episode 25 dialog, making the connection quite difficult to understand.)</description>
