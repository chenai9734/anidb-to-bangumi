<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="194756">It`s a very powerful film overall, and a good watch. Though be warned this is a serious film and quite an emotional rollercoaster ride, don`t expect this to be a lighthearted comedy because it`s actually pretty depressing throughout.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="371579">While I appreciate we got animated adaptation it still didn`t do the justice to the source. Skipped a lot of content that made story more engaging with better understanding of characters and their growth. In movie u see fraction of that. I think they need to reboot this into tv series to cover everything what manga has to offer (won`t happen anyway lol).
So my take is this... Watch movie then read manga.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="48568">Beautiful movie. Deep and moving. Real life, where contempt is intertwined with friendship and hate is adjacent to love.
In my country will never get a license, so I would rather not buy it at a local store, but I will get directly from Japan. Definitely worth to have this title in my own collection.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="117266">Really a must see movie. A wonderful, heartbraking and sometimes breathetaking story.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="331743">Absolutely wonderful. A rollercoaster of realistic emotions with great direction.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="256352">素晴らしい !!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="144860">One of the best anime I`ve seen for years and after finishing it I had to come here and post. Reminds me of the film My Rainy Days for some reason, perhaps because of how powerful it is. Strongly recommend!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="475247">Breathtaking and masterpiece story. I don`t know what to say, just do yourself a favor and watch this movie. You thank me later. 

10/10</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="66097">A must see movie.  A beautiful story of childhood mistakes, atonement, love, and adolescence.  Delving into school life, bullying, and what it means to be human.  The movie was directed in such a way that you can relate and feel the emotions in the movie.  It`s neither contrived or feels like it`s forcing a message upon you.  The soundtrack was perfectly done for the movie and the visuals were just spectacular.  In my opinion, this movie ranks higher than Your Name but barely.  2016 was a great year for having those two movies.

Can`t recommend this one enough.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="423685">As an ardent fan of the source material, I was happy to know it will be adapted into anime. The end result is amazingly satisfying. I know it can`t do full justice to the original - a movie has limitations. Regardless, I would recommend it to anybody and everybody - fan of the manga or not.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="164713">Great direction, scenario, music and visuals. The way emotions are presented in this show is fenomenal. I think everyone will be able to related to some of the charaters presented here. 

Just amazing. Recommended for everyone. Really great watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="396857">Everybody`s already given good, detailed descriptions, so I`ll just say: It`s really good, really beautiful, and really moving. Must see for me. Go watch!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="730431">One of the greatest of this year (It just started showing in my country theaters)/last year. Great story and characters, good visual. A must see movie, also the BD is coming up soon.</recommendation>

<description>In the context of manga and associated media, shounen, literally meaning "youth" and often also specifically "boy", refers to a male audience roughly between the ages of 10 and 18.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>Asia is Earth`s largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometers, about 30% of Earth`s total land area and 8.7% of the Earth`s total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

<name>school life</name>
<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<description>In the strict sense the Coming of age describes a young person`s transition from adolescence to adulthood. In anime the term is used in a more general sense where the protagonists have to face a challenge, make an important decision in their life, take on responsibility, or learn a lesson, and by overcoming these obstacles they reach a higher level of maturity.</description>

<description>For some reason the protagonists father is no longer among the living. The much too early death was due to sickness or accident.
This plot device adds a certain degree of tragedy to the anime and usually has repercussions on the rest of the family: Possibly the grieve-stricken mother and children barely function as humans. Or adding emphasis to the overall financial predicament of the family, should the father have been the money earner.</description>

The movie must be feature-length. For shorts, use the `short movie` tag. In general, a "show-in-show" would not qualify as standalone. For example, an anime has a cartoon show within it. If the show within was released as an OVA or movie, it would not be considered standalone.</description>

<name>gender bender</name>
<description>Term used to refer to a person who takes on the role of their opposite gender. This often only reaches to the extent of cross-dressing (involving physical appearance and clothing only), but in rarer cases, involves a total gender swap (which seems to be more common in anime) - where the willing or unwilling victim receives a body opposite of their original gender (either permanently or temporarily), with all natural parts per their new body fully (or just all-out amply) included.
Example of cross-dressing gender bender: "Maria+Holic"
Examples of body-swap gender bender: "Kashimashi: Girl meets Girl", "Birdy the Mighty Decode"</description>
