<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="165460">A pity, they`ve packed 145 manga volumes into 12 episodes. No wonder it feels way too rushed and shallow, alas, still a great show, just poorly adapted.

For the full experience i`d recommend actualy picking up the manga.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="336326">Very good love story! 
It have a nice start and good writtent relations between characters. But the changes in relations was soo fast so it`s hard to understand why the main heroine do this in second half after what happend in first.
Anyway I enjoyed it a lot and this story gives me a burst of emotions.

<description>* Based on a manga by http://anidb.net/cr10802 [Seo Kouji], serialised in http://anidb.net/cr17160 [Weekly Shounen Magazine].
http://anidb.net/ch38263 [Eba Yuzuki] had mysteriously decided to go to high school in the countryside and despite http://anidb.net/ch38264 [Kirishima Haruto]`s objections, began living in his home. Following a string of incidents and romantic mishaps, also involving http://anidb.net/ch38281 [Kanzaki Nanami], Haruto`s first love, he was finally able to confess his love to Eba before she moved back to Tokyo and they began a long-distance relationship. But then one day, Eba stops all contact to Haruto.
Thus Kirishima Haruto moves from the countryside in Hiroshima to the city of Tokyo, under the pretence to pursue a career as a cook. In reality he seeks to come close to Eba, his supposed true love, who he deems to be in trouble. Finally in Tokyo he soon makes friends with http://anidb.net/ch55476 [Mishima Asuka], a neighbour of his sister, who at first mistakes him for a burglar. Following another string of mishaps his initial determination begins to wane. Is Eba really his true love or is Asuka the one for him?</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<description>Computer-generated imagery (CGI) or computer animation is the art of creating moving images via the use of computers. It is a subfield of computer graphics and animation. Increasingly it is created by means of 3D computer graphics, though 2D computer graphics are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time rendering needs. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another medium, such as film.</description>

<name>excessive censoring</name>
<description>There are basically two cases to which this term can be applied to:
1) creative censorship
The TV station airing the anime does its best to remove most ecchi parts from the show, using various and original methods. Usually, an uncensored BD/DVD is released later. Apart from the publisher`s greed - sometimes the censorship is used intentionally to make a scene look more obscene than it actually is.
2) convenient censorship
Another case of it - more often known under the term of "convenient censoring/ship" - is a blatant substitute for mosaic/steam/etc. over nether regions. This applies both to normal shows with occasional nudity as a normal part of human life (or just occasional flash of fanservice), as well as to heavy ecchi / borderline hentai shows where /literally/ everything is a fair (and far more "obscene" no matter how to look at it) game, except that misinterpreted taboo nonsense coming from §175 of JPC.</description>

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

<name>Eba Yuzuki</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The female protagonist of the series. She moved from Tokyo to her father`s hometown. She is staying with the Kirishimas, who are her father`s acquaintances. She has a sociable personality and gets along with others easily. She confesses that she likes Haruto, but it does not prevent her from helping Haruto get closer to Nanami. It is later on revealed in the manga that she had met Haruto once when they were children at the summer festival, and he found her when she was lost and in tears. She consoled Haruto when he was dumped by Nanami. Yuzuki ends up moving back to Tokyo in order to work things out with her troubled family. Prior to her departure, she accepted Haruto`s confession and agreed to have a long distance relationship with him.
A short time later, Yuzuki cuts off all contact with Haruto and avoids Haruto`s request to meet up. Nanami hears from Rin that Eba apparently has a new boyfriend. Yuzuki apparently "explains" this to Haruto in a letter that came with the shirt she bought for him (that Haruto was ignorant of for around a month before it accidentally fell out of the bag). She explains how she must date a boy from her old middle school and therefore must break up with Haruto. However, after reading the letter Haruto decides that the letter`s content was not something Yuzuki would write, and that something has happened to her once again.
It turns out that she really does have a boyfriend, who turns out to be Haruto`s new friend, Kazama. She coldly rejected Haruto and any attempt to see her until one day Kazama collapsed because of his illness, and they meet again at the hospital, in the room where Kazama was staying. After learning the truth, Haruto questions her motives and why she dumped him back then, and she tells him that she knew Kazama since middle school, but after Kazama confessed his love to her, she rejected him multiple times and moved to Hiroshima. After she moved back to Tokyo, Kazama confessed his love to Yuzuki to her again, only this time he revealed that he doesn`t have much left to live, and wants to spend the little time he has with Eba. After Kazama`s funeral, Eba, perhaps feeling guilty about inadvertently contributing to his death, tells Haruto that it is best that they never see each other. Two years later she once again crosses path with Haruto. With every chance encounter, it becomes more apparent that Eba still has lingering feelings for him. Recently Yuzuki confessed to Haruto again, and now they are forging ahead with a new relationship despite everyone`s objections. Later on when Haruto moves to a place near Yuzuki`s house to live they start meeting often but after hearing that Yuzuki`s parents are Shifting to Nagoya Haruto visits her house and Yuzuki`s father`s sudden visits reveals their relationship despite Yuzuki`s father trying to break their relationship Yuzuki leaves the house and starts living with Haruto.

<name>Kirishima Haruto</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The male protagonist of the series. He has a reserved personality, which causes him to become perturbed by Yuzuki and his sister`s actions. He has a very strong sense of responsibility and consideration for others. He became a member of the school cooking club because he thought that Nanami would also join.
Before the series, he always lived in his hometown. He met a lost Yuzuki during the festival while they were children; he took care of her and told her that if she ever had problems she could come see him again. Entering in middle school he secretly had a crush on Nanami.
At the beginning of the series when Yuzuki had come to his house, he was irritated with her and did not remember meeting her before. But he becomes protective of her and they become good friends. Thanks to Yuzuki he gets closer to Nanami and finally confesses his love to her, but Nanami replies that she wants them to stay friends and tells him that she wants more time to think. Yuzuki also confesses her love to him, saying that he`ll fall for her eventually, but she believes that first he`ll end up with Nanami.
When Yuzuki has a personal problem and needs to travel to Tokyo, he gets on a train with her and helps her with family problems. But weeks later, Nanami discovers that he hid the fact that he travelled with Yuzuki instead of going on the date they planned together. She first seems to be able to forgive him for that, but after he chooses to retrieve a missing Yuzuki instead of staying with her, she decides to reject him. Rejected by Nanami, Haruto is consoled by Yuzuki and also realises that Nanami probably rejected him due to Yuzuki`s close presence in his life. Later, Nanami confirms this, but when Haruto asks her to hide that from Yuzuki (to not hurt her), she slaps him, saying no to playing with her feelings, because the person he really loves is Yuzuki. At the same time Yuzuki announces that she`ll be back to Tokyo in April, her family issues being partly solved. He eventually invites her to the Kouyasai Festival but she explains that they can`t date now, because she can stay for only a few months.
When the day of Yuzuki`s return to Tokyo arrives and Haruto finally sums up the courage to confess his love and requests that she stays by his side forever instead of returning to Tokyo. As she boards the train to Tokyo, she agrees to have a long distance relationship. Planning to meet her and buy her a gift during a school field trip to Tokyo, he finds a job at a restaurant in Hiroshima, where he meets Shiho Amagi, who shares with him the dream of becoming a chef. During the school trip Nanami asks him to temporarily pose as her boyfriend to impress a boastful friend, after which they are eventually discovered holding hands on a train station by Yuzuki. Haruto then decides to meet up with her in person to clear the misunderstanding. Yuzuki explains she understands and forgives him for what happened, then he gives her a kiss for the first time. But for several weeks after the trip Yuzuki doesn`t contact him, while his phone number seems blocked. Haruto believes that Yuzuki has broken up with him which results in him becoming deeply depressed. Nanami, who still loves him, and is pained by how he became, decides to make a move, by joining the cooking club with him and meeting him regularly. After she was informed by Rin that Yuzuki got a new boyfriend before the school trip, Nanami decides to confess her love to Haruto. However, Haruto later rejects her confession after he discovers a letter he has been long ignorant of in the bag that had the shirt Eba gave to him, believing that something had happened to Eba rather than Eba finding a new boyfriend and cutting off all contact with him. Due to this, he decided to transfer to a school in Tokyo after the school term.

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>She is Haruto`s friend since childhood. She has a cheerful personality, but according to Haruto, she often hides her feelings from others. As a child she was a tomboy, often getting into fights because her father was Russian and she inherited his blue eyes and light hair. Haruto and Takashi take her side in childhood and the three become inseparable friends. She is part of the tennis club along with Yuzuki. She was upset that Haruto decided to go to Tokyo for Yuzuki at first, but got over it later. She may also have romantic feelings for him since she kissed him as a going away present and told him to think of it if he was lonely. Akari goes to Seijo University with Haruto, Asuka, Nanami, Takashi and Kiyomi. After not even a year in college, she feels homesick and decides to move back to Hiroshima to work in her dad`s company. During this time she grew close to Nanami`s brother, Narumi, eventually leading to them going out and their engagement. When she briefly returns to Tokyo to visit, she informs Haruto of it, but also, having a case of cold feet, tries to make love to him, feeling it would be the only way she could move on from her old feelings for Haruto, but Haruto stops her.</description>

<name>Kanzaki Nanami</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>She is Haruto`s classmate and love interest since middle school. She has a modest personality and is somewhat insecure as she once stated that she felt like an outsider with Haruto, Yuzuki, Takashi, and Akari. Haruto confesses his love to her, but she rejects him although afterwards they become better friends and she then tells him she wants time to reconsider her rejection. At the summer festival, when Rin and Itsuki come to visit Yuzuki, Rin speaks with Nanami about Nanami`s true feelings for Haruto and how Haruto served as a "safety net" for Nanami. Later, during the festival, Nanami made her decision to reject Haruto, after hearing that Haruto looked for Yuzuki when she was missing and because of jealousy over Yuzuki; one of the many reasons was because he seemed to care more about Yuzuki than her, making her insecure about dating him. Since then she has been avoiding Haruto because their situation and acting extremely cold towards him.
Nanami later visits Tokyo with Haruto on a school trip. She follows him as he went to give a present to Yuzuki and asks Haruto if he can pretend to be her boyfriend for a moment and holds his hand. This leads to a misunderstanding between Haruto and Yuzuki, that appears to ultimately result in Yuzuki breaking up with Haruto. When Haruto returns to their home town, Nanami feels bad seeing how depressed Haruto is. As a result, Nanami appears to have finally recognized her true feelings for him and is now actively pursuing Haruto so she can become his girlfriend. She recently quit her manager position with the baseball club not only to join Haruto in the cooking club but also so she can walk home with him. Kanzaki then hears from Rin that Yuzuki has a new boyfriend, but doesn`t tell Haruto since he seems much happier lately. However, after discovering that Haruto is still secretly hoping Yuzuki will come back to him, she reveals the truth about Yuzuki`s new boyfriend and confesses her desire to be his girlfriend. He then proceeds to put her confession on hold because he believes that Yuzuki is in trouble and does not believe that the letter she wrote is the full truth. After Haruto returns from Tokyo in the winter, she claimed having moved on, but she blushed when Haruto said that the reason why he remembers her birthday (the first time they saw each other since he transferred) is because he likes her.
Nanami later attends Seijo University with Haruto, Asuka, Takashi, Akari and Kiyomi.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Asuka Mishima is Haruto`s ex-girlfriend and classmate. She is also a friend and neighbor of Haruto`s older sister, Aoi. She enters Haruto`s life after mistaking him for a burglar and subduing him with a baseball bat. Originally from Fukushima and possessed of a loud and fiery personality, Asuka eventually develops a crush on Haruto; her feelings eventually get through and they begin dating. Asuka is a compassionate girl and is forgiving of Haruto`s mistakes, such as when Haruto and Shiori Amaya were discovered walking out of a love hotel. Haruto is forced to explain what was he doing there, but he could not because Shiori has reasons to keep it a secret. Haruto then explains himself to Asuka and she forgives him, not asking about the details. Recently Asuka and Haruto have tried to make time to go on a trip together to move their relationship to the next stage but they have not been able to since Asuka had to return home to Fukushima to help with some family issues. Surprisingly, Asuka comes to Hiroshima to surprise Haruto, but discovers that he had gone to the summer festival with Yuzuki, where she had confessed to Haruto. After returning to Tokyo, the two break up.
The character design and name is likely a reference to Asuka Kazama from the Tekken games. The main story of Tekken is about the feuds between the members of the Mishima family.</description>
