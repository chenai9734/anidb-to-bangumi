<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="61079">Watch the first season (it was quite faithful), then READ the remaining 110+ chapters they crammed into 4 episodes, cutting away 70%-80% of the material away in the process. Some of it quite essential.

It`s still good finish, but ... ehhh. What a waste a the same time.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="728225">I am so glad they finished relife. Bestest ending ever!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="274570">A satisfying end for the series well done.

I haven`t seen a good ending as this for a while.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="430272">If you saw the first season then this finishes it up! Highly skipped content I could feel but have not read the manga...yet!! It seemed like the team just wanted to give the fans some closure. But definitely if you’ve seen the first season get that closure!!</recommendation>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

<name>in medias res</name>
<description>In medias res, also medias in res (Latin for "into the midst of affairs (lit. into mid-affairs)"), refers to a literary and artistic technique where the narrative starts in the middle of the story instead of from its beginning. It is generally a plot-driven concept rather than a character-driven one; though characters are commonly used to provide the backstory. The characters, setting, and conflict are often introduced through a series of flashbacks or through characters relating past events to each other.
Probably originating from an oral tradition, the technique is a convention of epic poetry, one of the earliest and most prominent examples in Western literature being Homer`s Odyssey and Iliad. Virgil`s Aeneid began the tradition in literature of imitating Homer, continued in Torquato Tasso`s Jerusalem Delivered, John Milton`s Paradise Lost and "Inferno" from Dante`s Divine Comedy. George Lucas`s Star Wars saga was told using in medias res.</description>

<name>ensemble cast</name>
<description>A show with an ensemble cast focuses on a larger group of main characters in a single plot narrative; anime containing several segmented plot narratives (such as episodic or arc-based plots) are excluded. As such, it doesn`t really have a "main" or "lead" character; instead, every member of the central main character group plays an important part in the show`s grander scheme; no single character is more important or prominent than the others (equality of importance). Further, subplots (if any) lead by each character in the ensemble have equal weighting in importance (or lack of weight).

* In a show where no single main character is more important or prominent than the others, 4+ main characters is almost always an ensemble cast.
* A show with 3 main characters of equal importance is likely also an ensemble cast; equality of importance must be considered carefully.
* A show with 2 main characters of equal importance is generally not an ensemble cast situation; however, on an exception basis where neither main character is considered an antagonist, a 2-main-character anime may be considered an ensemble (e.g. http://anidb.net/a11829 [Kimi no Na wa.]).

<description>A watercolour or aquarelle is a painting method in which the paints are made of pigments suspended in a water-based solution. Some anime are created in the style of watercolour paintings, the watercolour style, usually with faded pastels that often give the show a warm and friendly visual presentation. In modern anime, this is generally achieved via computer effects that create an imitation of watercolour, rather than by creating real-life watercolour art. While the watercolour style is more commonly used for backgrounds, it is possible to create the entire anime in such a style.</description>

<description>Hishiro Chizuru is a very smart but socially awkward classmate of http://anidb.net/ch79914 [Arata]. She usually scores the top grades in her year, which makes her the class representative and has all her school expenses paid for as a result. She is not only socially awkward, but also fairly ignorant with regards to anything not directly related to school matters, particularly social and emotional ones. She`s always doing research online on whatever she doesn`t understand.

<description>Kaizaki Arata is a 27-year old man who only appears to be 17-years old high school student, as a result of participating as test subject in ReLife Project. He was approached by http://anidb.net/ch81232 [Yoake Ryou] who explained him the rules he need to follow and goal to achieve as a test subject, as well as gave him the pill that made him younger in appearance. Ryou also became his supervisor.
As a high school student, Arata is predictably seen as mature by his classmates and has no problem easily making friends. He has forgotten most of his high school lessons, so he needs to take many remedial tests.

<summary>At Arata’s apartment, Ryo tells Arata that his ReLife was a huge success and offers him a list of jobs and a pill that will end his ReLife. At Chizuru’s apartment, An is doing the same thing with Chizuru. Chizuru falls asleep after taking the pill and An sees that she had written “I was in love with Kaizaki Arata” on her hand and feels sad that she will have to erase it. Before taking the pill, Arata tells Ryo that he wants to work for ReLife Laboratories. Later, at a ReLife Company dinner, Arata meets Chizuru, who is also working for ReLife. They do not recognize each other, but Chizuru learns that Arata was a ReLife subject.
After dinner, they bump into each other outside the restaurant. Chizuru tells Arata that she too was a ReLife subject and Arata asks Chizuru about her ReLife experience. She replies that it was like a firework. This triggers the memory of being together at the fireworks festival for both of them. Then with their memories restored, Chizuru walks into Arata’s waiting arms.

However, after talking it over with Honoka and Rena, she asks Arata out for a Christmas date. During the date, they end up buying phone straps for each other. As they walk home later, Arata blurts out that he loves Chizuru. Chizuru is taken aback, but then realizes her own feelings for Arata are also of love and tells him so. It starts to rain and they both walk back hand in hand holding Chizuru’s umbrella.

<summary>Chizuru loses the position of class representative to Rena. Realizing she was preoccupied with her feelings for Arata, Chizuru confronts Ryo asking him if Arata is a ReLIFE subject. He doesn`t want to confirm it, warning her that exposing a test subject would end the experiment for him and they would never see each other again. Ryo reveals to her that An works for ReLIFE and is her new supervisor. An suggests Chizuru wants Arata to be a test subject, as she could act on her feelings if he were a grown-up. After Kazuomi talks Arata into volunteering as the boys` representative heading the preparations for the cultural festival, Chizuru volunteers for the girls.
