<description>Ga-nime (画ニメ), a portmanteau of "illustration" (画) and "anime", is a relatively recent trend in Japanese animation to create highly aesthetic short anime films using non-traditional animation techniques, often directed by artists who have limited involvement with the anime industry. Typically, these films will utilize a series of illustrations accompanied by voice acting and music, with the only motion provided by extremely simplified limited animation, computer animation, camera movements such as panning and zooming, or stop-motion animation. They are generally produced by only a handful of staff members, with the director often writing, illustrating, or even scoring the piece themselves.
Similar to comics, ga-nime will be composed of a series of static pictures accompanied by music and speech. This "limited-anime" approach leaves behind the complex plot and characters found in most anime, and aims to stimulate the audience`s imagination through various techniques such as the manipulation of time between each picture.
Usually creating an anime requires many staffs and an expensive budget, making it difficult for the artist to manage the project on his or her own, which results in a lack of creativity and coordination in most anime series.
Unlike anime, ga-nime will limit the number of images used in each series, allowing the artist to better integrate his or her own style and feelings into the project. This new form of media has immense potential for pushing the level of style and creativity found in artworks to a whole new level.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Music anime generally revolves around people concerned with music in their everyday lives. In addition they often adhere to certain genre conventions, the emphasis on training and practice in preparation for competitions, characters desire for self improvement, and pursuit of a specific goal. This is not unlike the Sports category.</description>

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>multi-anime projects</name>
<description>Many anime are created as part of larger projects encompassing many shows without direct relation to one another. Normally, there is a specific idea in mind: for example, the http://anidb.net/t4859 [Young Animator Training Project] aims to stimulate the on-the-job training of next-generation professionals of the anime industry, whereas the http://anidb.net/t3763 [World Masterpiece Theatre] aims to animate classical stories from all over the world.</description>
