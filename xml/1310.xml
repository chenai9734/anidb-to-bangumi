<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="191899">While the second the third arcs are really quite isolated from the main world and feel like fillers from another genre of anime, the last arc (which is probably the reason you want to watch this) makes up for that, as it is nearly on par with the main series. All arcs are pretty much unrelated, so you might just want to watch the first and fourth arc as well.</recommendation>

<description>The military, also known as the armed forces, are forces authorized and legally entitled to use deadly force so as to support the interests of the state and its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its citizens and the prosecution of war against foreign powers. The military may also have additional functions within a society, including construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding critical areas.

<name>detective</name>
<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<description>The conspiracy thriller (or paranoid thriller) is a sub-genre of the thriller which flourished in the 1970s in the US (and was echoed in other parts of the world) in the wake of a number of high-profile scandals and controversies (most notably Vietnam, the assassination of President Kennedy, Chappaquiddick and Watergate), and which exposed what many people regarded as the clandestine machinations and conspiracies beneath the orderly fabric of political life.
The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top".</description>

<name>machiavellian intrigues</name>
<description>Named after Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli (3 May 1469 - 21 June 1527). Machiavelli is considered one of the founders of modern political science, and was a philosopher and diplomat.
He is famous for his political treatise `The Prince`, which is essentially a manual about the acquisition and maintenance of power, including the need for deceit and the application of armed force.
It is the use of deceit from which the term `Machievellian` derives. This term generally applies to a person who uses deceit to manipulate others for their own amoral (and usually power hungry) ends.
This anime contains at least one character whose intrigues drive the plot.</description>

<name>space opera</name>
<description>Space opera is a sub-genre of fiction that emphasizes romantic adventures in space. Space opera generally involves large-scale conflicts between opponents with powerful abilities and technology. The genre will often be melodramatic, sometimes playing music that can be nothing short of awesome. Warfare and a battle of wits are usually less emphasized, preferring romance (with exceptions, e.g. Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu). Some space operas tend to be formulaic and sometimes even prosaic, often employing very simple devices and somewhat obvious strategies. An example of this would be the infamous laws of physics in the Macross universe, in which the main male lead will hardly ever get hit in battle.</description>

<description>Wolfgang Mittermeyer was an Imperial Fleet Admiral who served as the Supreme Space Fleet Commander under http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm] and was a skilled tactician, becoming one of the two "Twin Pillars" of Reinhard`s Goldenlöwe Dynasty. For his lightning-fast tactics in combat, Mittermeyer was known by the nickname of "Gale Wolf." He was a close friend of Fleet Admiral http://anidb.net/ch194 [Oskar von Reuenthal], another brilliant commander and the second member of the Twin Pillars, with whom he served as one of the two best commanders in Reinhard`s New Galactic Empire. With the deaths of http://anidb.net/ch187 [Siegfried Kircheis], Reuenthal, and http://anidb.net/ch195 [Paul von Oberstein], Mittermeyer was the last of Reinhard von Lohengramm`s early supporters against the Goldenbaum Dynasty and high nobles left alive.

<description>Oskar von Reuenthal was an Imperial Fleet Admiral who served as the Chief of High Command Office, Governor-General of the former Alliance territory, and was one of the "Twin Pillars" of Kaiser http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard]`s Goldenlöwe Dynasty. Nicknamed the "Bewitching Eyes" for his http://anidb.net/t1065 [heterochromatic eyes], Reuenthal was a brilliant commander and was considered to be second only to Reinhard in terms of strategic ability. He was a close friend of fellow Fleet Admiral http://anidb.net/ch193 [Wolfgang Mittermeyer], the Supreme Fleet Commander and the other one of the Twin Pillars of the Goldenlöwe Dynasty. The two of them were some of Reinhard von Lohengramm`s earliest supporters against the Goldenbaum Dynasty and high nobles ruling the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [first Empire]. However, after complex scheming by various interests behind the scenes, Reuenthal ended up being forced into rising in rebellion against his Kaiser, only to fall in battle.
Fleet Admiral von Reuenthal had been regarded as one of the five best tacticians of that era, and also proved himself to be a capable administrator as the Governor-General of the occupied Alliance territories.

Unable to accept losing the emperor`s favour, Beenemünde hatched several plots to win back Friedrich`s favour. Mostly, these involved assassination attempts on Annerose`s younger brother, http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm]. These ill-conceived attempts all failed, yet there was never sufficient proof to indict the Baroness.
As her last, desperate act, Lady Beenemünde decided to murder Annerose von Grünewald herself. Beenemünde`s grief at having been stricken from Friedrich`s sight was so great that she believed he would return to her, if only Annerose were dead. The plan failed, and at the order of the Kaiser, Beenemünde was forced to drink poison, thus committing suicide. It was announced to the public that she died of natural causes, and Kaiser Friedrich IV personally attended her funeral.

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Yang Wenli is one of two protagonists within the series. Like http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard], both of them share similar roles within their respective nations as famous national heroes renowned for their military skill. Compared to Reinhard, Yang is much more humble and dislikes his popularity as being a burden. Yang originally wanted to become a historian and only attended the Free Planets Defense Force Command Academy so he can get free education, while Reinhard relishes his fame and was ambitious to overthrow the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [empire].
At the start of the series, Yang has gained some fame as the "Hero of El Facil" for his exploits in the evacuation of the planet before Imperial occupation, and gains much more fame to become a national hero by the end of the first season. During the second season, he generally takes a lesser role compared to Reinhard, but returns in full force in third season before he is assassinated by members of the Terraist Church.
Yang was a mild-tempered person who lives on red tea, a genius tactician and strategist that exceeds even Reinhard. His weakness lies in his unwillingness to risk democracy by assuming more direct powers and responsibilities. Not willing to take on a bigger role or responsibility, he and Reinhard`s battle were never in equal footing and at same time handcuffing him from doing things that could change the scale of the power balance. He also openly respects Reinhard and considers him to be a true genius as Reinhard`s ability does not seem to confine in just military affairs and is able to act on what his mind tells him while Yang might be reluctant to do so if given same situation. He also agrees that benevolent autocracy is better and more efficient than corrupted democracy if social change is needed, and noted that if he was born in the empire, he would actually volunteer to serve under Reinhard despite his dislike of military. On the other hand, he was glad to be born in Free Planets as it gives him the freedom, and believes that while democracy is less efficient and can be slowed dramatically with corruption it nevertheless is better because it is less likely to be corrupted completely and no one has absolute power, because after all, a good and wise Emperor such as Reinhard doesn`t come along often.
The http://anidb.net/ch82015 [Hyperion] is the flagship of Yang Wenli`s fleet. It is retrofitted from a frontier security squadron flagship. It is lightly armed, possessing only 32 forward cannons which comprise its main armament. It possesses a large and spread out multi-level bridge with a large conference table commonly used for meetings by Admiral Yang and his staff, as well as a large tactical viewscreen used during battle to display fleet movements.

A flying ace with over 250 kills (which he estimated would put him in the all-time top 10), he moved up the ranks from flying officer when in http://anidb.net/ch740 [Vice Admiral Paeta]`s 2nd fleet through squadron leader, commanding one half of the Iserlohn stationed fleet`s Spartanians, to wing commander under http://anidb.net/ch737 [Yang Wen-li].
Brash, hard-drinking, womanising and wise-cracking, he was the perfect foil to his good friend, the calm, nap-taking, crossword-puzzle-solving http://anidb.net/ch781 [Ivan Konev]. Together, the two of them were in charge of training fresh recruits to their squadrons. In this role, he mentored both http://anidb.net/ch1298 [Karin] and http://anidb.net/ch742 [Julian].
In keeping with his womanising and drinking, he flew with an ace of hearts insignia on his helmet and his Spartanian (No. 170), and his squadrons were named after a variety of liquors. He belied his brashness, though, by advocating teamwork and many-on-one tactics with his pilots, rather than urging them to individual glory.</description>
