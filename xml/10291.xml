<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="449787">One of my favorite anime in this year. Cool mecha with trans ability that makes you want to watch it to the end of series. Once you see it, u can`t turn back until it finished. Story is quite good, but lacks of MC ability on control his mecha itself is the backward, but the rest is no problem.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="284224">If you are fun of Sunrise and love gundams it`s anime for you a lot of fun but 1st season for me was a little bit too short - everything was nicely done and the ending is great!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="520752">Although it doesn’t seem at first, the story is falling in place just the right way. In this anime, time-travel somehow makes sense. Also the fighting scenes and war tactics are totally believable. There are definitely better mecha-anime out there, but this one has something more than giant robots. If you are able to look past some classic flaws of anime like the need to tell „hundred“ character background stories in the shortest time humanly possible, then what you get is one of this year’s top10 anime. Rather than preparing for the second season, it would be better to stretch the first one up to 22 episodes and get more substance and maybe some twist into the story.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="273035">Great anime, 1 ep starts like normal HS series, after that boom ! That fight, plot and characters!!
Watched it in one blow, last series that i watched all day was Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood :) So yes, i long wated for similar anime.
Must see 9/10</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="75448">One of 2014`s bests so far, story is nicely paced, makes you want to see next episode right away, good mecha show!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="409046">It was fun, interesting. The ending felt a bit rushed (rushed like they realized they don`t have money for more episodes, and desperately wanted everything to fall in place and make sense). Yet they have a really bad and unnecessary cliffhanger at the very end.</recommendation>

<description>On the first day back after summer break, high-school student Aoba is attacked by a giant robot that appears out of the sky. As he`s pursued through the city, his classmate Hina appears in a robot of her own. She rescues him, and tells him cryptically that "Dio is waiting for you", before she disappears. This begins Aoba`s new life as the pilot of the Free Treaty Alliance against the Great Zogiria Republic.

<name>robot</name>
<description>A robot is an automatically guided machine, able to do tasks on its own. Another common characteristic is that by its appearance or movements, a robot often conveys a sense that it has intent or agency of its own.
Not to be confused with android (human-like robot).</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>war</name>
<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<name>time loop</name>
<description>A time loop is a common plot device in science fiction (especially in universes where time travel is commonplace). Events in the story repeat themselves a number of times with or without some variation with each pass. Most characters either do not realise this is occurring or are attempting to break the cycle in some way. 
One well-known example of this is in the 1993 film Groundhog Day, in which the main character is the only one aware of the time loop, although time loops had appeared in many fictional works prior to that. Stories with time loops commonly center on correcting past mistakes or on getting a character to recognise some key truth; escape from the loop may then follow.</description>

<name>Super Robot Wars</name>
<description>Super Robot Wars is a series of tactical role-playing video games produced by Banpresto. The main feature of the franchise is having a story that crosses over several popular mecha anime, manga and video games, allowing characters and mecha from different titles to team up or battle one another. Due to the nature of crossover games and licensing involved, only a few games have been released outside Japan, and in English; early English-language games only feature Banpresto`s original characters and mecha, and a flagship installment were to never be released until 2016, with the English release of Super Robot Wars V in Southeast Asian countries. The franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2016.
