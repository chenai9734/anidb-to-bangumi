<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Rena is an elf living in the mortal world. Her place in this world is jeopardized by the weakening of El, the power gems that energize everything including the connection to her home world.

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Eve was an upper-class Nasod who once was called The Little Queen of Nasods, back when humans and Nasods coexisted in Ancient Elrios. However, the reign of prosperity was fleeting as the power of El began to weaken. Nasod civilization declined without its power source. They sought help from the humans but were denied and thus the war between them began.
Years passed with the humans winning the ancient war but at the same time diminished the El`s power. Only a few ancient Nasods survived the war and made it back into their preservation capsules. For thousands of years, Eve was preserved in her capsule unit to avoid the catastrophe until an El fragment accidentally flew into it. Eve woke up only to find out that she was stranded alone in this new present time. She gathered her remaining energy and ancient knowledge and joined the El Search Party to revive King Nasod and the Nasod race as the last Nasod in the world.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Add is a descendant of a family that researched Nasods and was exterminated after being caught researching their forbidden secrets.
Add fell into an Ancient Library while escaping and was trapped all alone. He spent his time reading books about Nasods and waited for the day he could escape. With his vast knowledge, Add eventually invented the Nasod Dynamo using the parts from broken down Nasods found inside the library. Using the weapon`s power, he escaped from the collapsing library. However, being trapped alone for so long left Add insane along with an obsession to find rare Nasod codes.
While traveling to look for more Nasod schematics, he found out that their race no longer existed. The library where Add had lived in distorted time inside and sent him far into the future. Thus, Add manipulateed Wally in order to gain strength and found a way to get back to the past. That was until Add found traces of http://anidb.net/ch87459 [Eve] from the corrupted Nasod King.
Add is technically an enemy of the El Search Party, but officially joins the main cast after the story in Ancient Waterway. His real name is Edward Grenore.
