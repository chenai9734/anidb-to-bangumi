<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="116870">I`d say it worth a look for the great action sequences and nice music. Could`ve needed more Accelerator action though... was really lookin forward to some scenes with him as he is my fave of the whole show, but we get nice fanservice (animators must`ve loved to draw Shutaura`s ass lol) instead.

Oh well, fans of the franchise will be pleased with it. It`s really weak compared to the TV Series though. Don`t expect too much.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="44864">For fans of the series, it is devoid of value to anyone else. Not even the animation can save this plot.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="478777">eeh..Okay watch I guess? Not much more than an extra story, almost filler like, with all the characters of the franchise involved...Recommended for the fans of the series</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="434710">Not as great as the series but still worth the time. So kick back and enjoy.</recommendation>

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>extrasensory perception</name>
<description>Extrasensory perception (ESP), involves reception of information not gained through the recognized physical senses but sensed with the mind. The term was coined by Sir Richard Burton, and adopted by Duke University psychologist J. B. Rhine to denote psychic abilities such as telepathy and clairvoyance, and their trans-temporal operation as precognition or retrocognition. ESP is also sometimes casually referred to as a sixth sense, gut instinct or hunch, which are historical English idioms. The term implies acquisition of information by means external to the basic limiting assumptions of science, such as that organisms can only receive information from the past to the present.
In Japanese usage the term is often misappropriated to refer to any supernatural, non-magical, super power. Users of such powers are called `esper` in Japanese. The term `esper` is not normally in use outside of Japan but is slowly being introduced due to its usage in anime and manga.
In anime/manga the following powers, among others, are described as ESP:
- telepathy
- precognition
- clairvoyance
- retrocognition
- remote viewing
- aura reading
- out-of-body experiences (OBE)
- psychokinesis</description>

<name>amnesia</name>
<description>The character suffers from some kind of amnesia (memory disturbance or loss). This may mean inability to memorize new information, or inability to recollect old memories. Since there are many types of memory, the person may e.g. forget who they are but still retain learned skills.
Amnesia is fairly common in fiction as a plot device. In fact, because it allows for major plot changes while requiring little creativity from the author, it may be subject to heavy overuse.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges.

Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>magic circles</name>
<description>A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised.
Traditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for non-magical work such as meditation.
Generally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

Her mind has been implanted with the 103,000 magical texts of the Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum as she possess Photographic memory at the cost of her own memories, or so the church authorities say. Her sorcery name is Dedicatus545. She is said to have 15% of memory space left to use in daily activities, which allows her to live normally for less than a year. However, all of this is a lie and are the church`s plan to make her unable to betray, by "maintenance" her once the memory has come to its limit.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kamijou Touma is the main protagonist of Toaru Majutsu no Index and a recurring character in its spin-off Railgun.
He has the lowest psychic rank possible at Level 0— largely because the people testing psychic abilities cannot detect or classify his abilities. Due to this, the founder of Academy City considers him neither a Psychic nor a Magician but rather a normal person with a unique ability.
Actually his power is Imagine Breaker (幻想殺し, Gensou Goroshi, "Imagine Killer"), a power which negates all magic, psychic, or divine powers but also his own good luck. He tends to stay away from trouble but possesses a strong sense of justice, albeit somewhat shallow and dogmatic. In order to save Index from the need of a memory reset, he had activated her self-protection system and destroyed the spell responsible for her mind strain but ended up losing all of his past memories, including everything about Index, when he came in contact with Feather of Light (光の羽, Hikari no Hane); this remains a secret to everyone except himself, the doctor that takes care of him (who is, unknown to Touma, the Heaven Canceler) and later Mikoto in the sixteenth novel. Though he no longer remembers the past, he has not completely forgotten the people he cares about.
Throughout the series, he tries to live his life normally while still facing against the many adversaries from the worlds of science and most of the magic and the conflicts that follow. Despite his very bad luck, he has managed to get the interests and hearts of many ladies who are infatuated with him, which Aisa jokes about, that his life is like a dating sim where he is bound to unlock more paths to more girls.</description>

<name>Misaka Mikoto</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Misaka Mikoto is one of the series` main heroines, as well as the main protagonist of the side story, A Certain Scientific Railgun. Her parents are Tabigake and Misuzu Misaka, which her father is a prominent businessman and millionaire. Despite her rich background, she grew up in a normal typical childhood.
At a young age, she was discovered to be a Level 1 Electromaster, espers who have the ability to generate and control electricity. She enrolled into Academy City to train her powers and worked very hard until her powers were ranked Level 5, the highest esper ranking, with her being the third strongest of the seven espers with this rank. As an electromaster, she can generate and manipulate electricity which she can use to shock opponents, hack into electronics like computer networks and security systems, and use electromagnetism to cling to surfaces or manipulate iron particles into a chain-sword whip. Mikoto`s signature move is her ability to shoot metal projectiles such as coins at high destructive speeds, hence her nickname, The Railgun. If she is in a bad mood, she will sometimes let out bursts of electricity describing her emotional stress, usually resulting in power failures or even citywide blackouts.
Mikoto attends Tokiwadai Middle School, a famous girls` school for the rich and elite psychics and one of the five elite schools of Academy City. To most people, she is considered a proper lady, but in reality, she has a short-tempered, prideful, and improper attitude with some tomboyish tendencies and insecurities, a fact few other characters know. She is fond of cute, childish things, such as flowery pajamas and Gekota, the popular frog mascot franchise. Contrary to what she claims, she has a strong sense of morals and hates injustice. Mikoto has a one-sided rivalry with Touma, who nicknamed her Biri Biri (ビリビリ, relating to the sound of an electric shock), ever since their first meeting before the events of the first novel when he first dissipated her electricity after he unsuccessfully tried to rescue her. Since that incident, she is always trying to have a proper match with Touma and defeat him despite his many attempts to avoid conflict with her.
When Mikoto was young, she was tricked into giving the city`s scientist her DNA under the pretense of finding the cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy; their actual goal to create military-grade combat clones of her. When it was discovered that the clones did not have the same power level as Mikoto, they were instead used in an Project called Level 6 Shift, intended to make Accelerator the first level 6 esper by having him kill 20,000 clones. The events of how Mikoto tried to stop the project are briefly mentioned in the third novel and expanded upon in the Railgun manga. When all of her attempts failed, she contemplates letting herself be killed by Accelerator, as an unexpected variable to destroy Tree Diagram`s calculations. However, it is not until Touma intervenes and beats Accelerator, proving him to be really weak, that the project is canceled and the remaining 9969 surviving Sisters are spared.
After those events, she eventually develops strong romantic feelings towards Touma but is unable to express them due to her insecurities and the fact other girls are also interested in him. Even though she and Touma tend to bicker and argue with each other, they share a somewhat friendly relationship.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kanzaki Kaori is an eighteen-year-old Japanese sorceress from Necessarius. Unlike her partner Stiyl, she uses magic to magically strengthen her body. Her sorcery name is Salvare000, "Be the salvation of those who cannot be saved" (救われぬ者に救いの手を, Sukuwarenu Mono ni Sukui no Te o). She uses a two-meter-long nodachi called "Seven Heavens Seven Swords" as her weapon. She has a special attack called Nanasen (七閃, "Seven Flash") that uses her sword and some wires. She used to be a kind woman who treated Index like a sister, but when Index`s memories were deleted by Necessarius, Kaori changed into a cold and silent woman as Index no longer remembered her and consequentially did not trust her. After Touma saves Index`s life and her current memories, she decides to let Index stay at Academy City as she feels Touma can protect her.
Later in the novels, more of her past is revealed. Not only is Kaori a skilled swordswoman, but she is a Catholic Saint possessing the "Stigma" — the ability to call upon God`s power — and the former leader of the Amakusa Catholics; however, Kaori left the group as she resented that she had been fated since birth to become its leader, which led her to despise the concept of luck and fortune. Though she is Catholic, she joined Necessarius in hopes of changing her fate and befriended Index, developing a sisterly relationship with her. The repeated failed attempts to make Index remember her after each memory erasure resulted in her cold personality as Kaori began to accept that no matter how much a person tries, no one can change their destiny. She begins to show a kinder side to herself after Touma saves Index (thus giving her hope that anyone can defy their destiny) and gradually falls in love with him after he helps her face her past with the Amakusa Catholics, becoming more prone to showing emotion and sometimes showing a little embarrassment if she is with him. She is the protagonist of her own spin-off mini light novel bundled with the Toaru Kagaku no Railgun DVDs.

<name>Accelerator</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Accelerator is the most powerful Psychic in Academy City. His real name is unknown, though Accelerator recalls his surname was composed of two characters and his given name consisted of three characters. First appearing as an antagonist, he later becomes a main character and the lead of the science side in the Toaru Majutsu no Index series. Because Accelerator has been this reflexively powerful since childhood, he was unstoppable even when the military was sent to kill him. However, these past influences resulted in his inability to trust others and he was left alone. After meeting Touma, he develops a sense of admiration and jealousy towards Touma`s heroism and ability to help others, contrasting with how Accelerator feels he is only able to destroy.
A sadistic boy about the same age as Touma, he has an ability called Vector Change, a form of telekinesis allowing him to change the vector values of anything he touches. This ability allows Accelerator perform feats such as reversing the blood flow inside a person`s body, increasing the wind velocity around him to create a massive plasma storm, and blocking sound. His ability is automatic, which means that he must consciously allow gravity to affect him and that his body blocks all ultraviolet radiation, resulting his albino appearance (white hair and pale skin) because his body is unable to make melanin. The automatic nature of Redirection also prevents the use of projectiles (like bullets) and explosives (like bombs) against him. After being shot by http://anidb.net/ch14551 [Amai Ao], Accelerator`s ability to use his power is hindered, but slowly recovers with the help of http://anidb.net/ch14534 [Heaven Canceller] and the http://anidb.net/ch14538 [Misaka Network]. However, he is forced to use a cane and is restricted to using his ability for only 15 minutes at a time, as well as losing more than half of his computation ability even with 10,000 sisters doing calculations for him.
Accelerator`s unique ability make him the subject of an experiment attempting to create the first Level 6 psychic; according to the city`s best supercomputer, Tree Diagram (which was unprecedentedly destroyed by Index`s Dragon Breath), this feat could only be achieved by killing 128 skilled Level 5 psychics without a single failure. Since there are only six other known Level 5s in Academy City, an alternative plan was formed to level up Accelerator by having him kill 20,000 skilled Level 2 psychics: the Misaka clones. He willingly joins the experiment to gain a reputation as the most powerful and feared psychic that no one would be foolish enough to challenge and even killed many who got in his way. The Sisters` memories of his behavior during the experiment may suggest that he is, in a way, a pacifist; since his power won`t disappear, the only way he sees to stop fighting is to be so strong and sadistic that no one would raise a finger against him. He even seems to attempt to frighten the Sisters or otherwise encourage them to refuse the battle. Mikoto tries to stop the experiment to save her sisters, but it is Touma who finally does so and defeats Accelerator after discovering his weakness: Accelerator was physically weak because of his total reliance on his powers. Overconfidence in his psychic abilities resulted in his defeat as Touma beat him with his Imagine Breaker and street-fighting skills.
After his defeat, he reappears later and takes a more heroic role protecting a girl named Last Order, the last Misaka clone. In the aftermath of the incident, Accelerator is shot in the head by Amai Ao, damaging his brain and severely limiting the use of his power.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A blonde teenager who is always seen with sunglasses and wearing an Aloha shirt. He is a friend and classmate of Touma who just happens to be his next-door neighbor at the dormitory they`re staying at. While he seem like a normal, average teenager, there`s more to him than meets the eye. Secretly, Tsuchimikado is actually a former agent of Necessarius who became a freelance spy for Necessarius, Academy City, and other unknown organizations; the leaders of both Necessarius and Academy City are both aware of this but have decided to let him be for the time being. His sorcery name is Fallere825, `the back-stabber`.
He was formerly a skilled Onmyouji as his family are descendants of Abe no Seimei but gave up his abilities when he went under the ESP development curriculum. He has a younger step-sister named Maika, whom he is also in love with, and for this he is known as the Shisukon Gunsou (シスコン軍曹, "Sis-com Sergeant"). He is also a member of one of Academy City`s secret organizations, the "GROUP". His ESP ability is the Level 0 Auto Regeneration (肉体再生, Nikutai Saisei, lit. "Body Regeneration"). Due to this power, he can still use magic as he can repair the damage done to his body, making him the only successful psychic/magician hybrid. Despite these advantages, he avoids using magic except in the most desperate situations as he cannot avoid the extreme pain caused by using it.</description>

Often mentioned as "the Frog-Faced Doctor" by http://anidb.net/ch2342 [Kamijou Touma], he is an exceptionally-gifted and benevolent physician who can cure any illness and heal any injury, even if it is terminal. He is only unable to heal specific brain-related injuries, such as the "Imagine-Breaker Boy`s" damaged memories and http://anidb.net/ch10527 [Accelerator]`s computation ability; however, in the latter case, he was able to configure Accelerator to control his powers with support from the Misaka Network. This medical genius also manages the life extension devices for the ruler of http://anidb.net/ch34367 [Academy City], http://anidb.net/ch2731 [Aleister Crowley], while also supporting the foundation of the city itself.</description>

<name>Misaka Imouto</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Introduced in both the third volume of the novel and manga, respectively, and episode ten of the anime, Touma meets the younger `twin sister` of Mikoto who he calls Misaka`s sister (御坂妹, Misaka Imouto), who seems rather quiet and emotionless. Her voice is rather monotonous and computer-like. Her speech pattern is unique, for she talks in third person (adding a description of herself after she finishes talking). While both sisters may look alike from a distance, Misaka has paler eyes and wears striped panties under her skirt. Misaka also wears a special set of goggles that enables her to see electron beams and magnetic field lines for the reason that, unlike Mikoto, she does not have that ability. At the beginning of the third volume, Mikoto seems to dislike and worry about Misaka for some reason, and later events reveal why.
In reality, Misaka imouto is a clone of Mikoto; in fact, the first one Touma meets is No. 10032 out of 20,000 other clones (excluding Full-Tuning and Last Order) copied from Mikoto called `The Sisters`. Even though they have a weaker variant of Mikoto`s electric abilities (Level 3), the Sisters` minds are connected by a special psychic ability called Radio Noise (欠陥電気, Kekkan Denki?, "Flawed Electric"), which enables their brainwaves to become electric signals; this allows them to share their thoughts and memories within their communication network, also known as the Misaka Network. Being rapidly-manufactured clones, the Sisters rarely change their facial expression because they did not learn how to. Due to minds having connected to the Misaka Network, most of the Sisters never considered themselves human yet some of them had slight difference in personalities.
20,000 clones were created in total, to be used in an experiment designed to create the first Level 6 psychic ("Level 6 Shift"), Accelerator. By the time of third novel, 10,031 were killed in the experiment. After the Level 6 Shift experiment fails, all 9969 surviving Sisters are ordered back to the research center where they were created to have "readjustments" so that they will have normal life spans. The Sisters later began showing their owned unique personalities to differentiate themselves after learning how to `disconnect` from the Network and keeping their own private memories inaccessible to the others in the Network.
Misaka 10032, also known as Misaka Imouto, is the most prominent clone that is most featured in the series. She is known for having a soft spot for cats which she herself has a pet black kitten. She was the first sister clone that Touma met. Due to the many interactions she had with him, 10032 wonder why she thought about him so much. Misaka 10032 was Accelerator`s latest target in the Level 6 experiment, but Touma managed to stop him before he killed her. Confused, she asks him why he did so since she was a clone, to which he replied that even though she was a clone, she was still an individual with a life. His words (along with Mikoto`s) affect her so much that she and the Sisters decide to help Touma by controlling all of the city`s wind turbines to prevent Accelerator from creating a plasma storm.
After the Level 6 experiment was canceled, she was one of ten Sisters to stay in Academy City while the rest went overseas around the world for treatment. She later falls in love with Touma and receives a necklace from him (he bought it for her during his date with Mikoto and mistook 10032 for Mikoto) which she treasures.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Last Order is the name of http://anidb.net/ch2469 [Misaka Mikoto]`s No. 20001 clone. She is the administrator of the http://anidb.net/ch14538 [Misaka Network] and the fail-safe mechanism in case the Sisters got out of control. She is not designed to function independently and survive for long outside a culture container and appears to be only about ten years old. Due to intercepting an emotion program http://anidb.net/ch55166 [Nunotaba Shinobu] intended to install into all of the clones, she is capable of showing emotions unlike the other sisters and has a close relationship with Mikoto, http://anidb.net/ch14537 [Misaka Imouto], http://anidb.net/ch10527 [Accelerator] and her adult guardians, http://anidb.net/ch13691 [Yomikawa Aiho] and http://anidb.net/ch14552 [Yoshikawa Kikyou]. Like her older clone sisters, she speaks in third person with a description, except she says "Misaka" twice. She has all of the memories of the Misaka clones and has observed Accelerator through this method, posing a theory that Accelerator did not actually want to do the Level 6 Shift experiment.
Accelerator meets Last Order when she follows him home one day after he fends off a bunch of street thugs hearing of his defeat against a Level 0. Though Accelerator tries to dissuade her from hanging around him, she persists in following him around because she wants someone to keep her company. She is later kidnapped by http://anidb.net/ch14551 [Amai Ao] so he can infect the Misaka clones to possibly go on a rampage and attack people. Accelerator manages to stop him but gets injured in the process. Last Order and Accelerator are put under the care of Aiho after the incident. Accelerator does all he can to protect her since she is the first person in his life who requested his help. Throughout the story, she remains with Accelerator and has been involved in situations relating to him. After Accelerator`s confrontation with Aiwass, she is left in critical condition. However, Accelerator brings Last Order with him to Russia in hopes of finding http://anidb.net/ch870 [Index], who may have the knowledge to cure her.</description>

<description>The public moral committee. It is made up of students with powers from every grade level whose duty is to maintain peace and order within the school system. As most of the city population are students, it is the duty of Judgment to catch those delinquents misusing their powers along with other offenders and protect the students. Each district in Academy City has at least one Judgment branch office headed by a senior student who serves as a police chief. In the event of a situation that Judgment members cannot handle, their superiors and the city`s security forces, the Anti-Skills will take over. Overall, the role of a Judgment officer is more like a part-time civilian patrol officer as their authority is normally limited to their district area where their local Judgment branch office is located and they can only use their authority at other districts when ordered to by their superiors or in cases of emergency. Most Judgment members can be recognized by the green stripped arm band with a shield symbol they wear.</description>

<description>Anti-Skill is the city`s police and security forces. Unlike Judgment, most members of Anti-Skills are adults who are mostly normal people and even school teachers who are trained to deal with the city`s day-to-day activities and security, in addition to dealing with rogue psychics who abuse their powers. Most members of Anti-Skills are seen with special SWAT armor that resist psychic powers along with firearms and riot gear, which shows how serious the situation has to be for them to be called out. They are also responsible in investigating and stopping the experiments that are against the law and inhumane to students but due to the interventions by the city administration, they are stopped from investigating experiments that were approved by the Board of Directors. Their symbol is a three-point spear shaped like a capital "E" turned 90 degrees to the left.</description>

She is mentioned as the girl who is "pretty but lacks sex appeal".
