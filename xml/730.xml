<description>Among the 5 star systems known as the Joker Systems, there are many kingdoms. There are knights within the kingdoms and these knights who control giant robots, Mortar Headds, are called Headdliners. Bound to the knights are fatimas. Human in appearance and mind, the fatimas (mostly female) possess expanded physical capabilities and make it possible for a Headdliner to control a Mortar Headd. Fatimas cannot reproduce. All this is overseen by Emperor Amaterasu and his Mirage Knights.</description>

<description>A robot is an automatically guided machine, able to do tasks on its own. Another common characteristic is that by its appearance or movements, a robot often conveys a sense that it has intent or agency of its own.

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>mecha</name>
<description>Mecha in Japanese basically means mechanical things; everything from an electric whisk or a car to a spaceship or a robot. Here however we limit it to the more exotic things usually referred to as mecha anime: robots, whether controlled by a human or not, and their ilk. See Androids, Piloted Robots, Power Suits, Robot Helpers, Transforming Robots for a more specific classification.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>You can watch this movie without having to watch something else first. This tag should not used for sequels, side stories, or summary movies, but may be used if the movie is either the first anime in a franchise or a remake.
The movie must be feature-length. For shorts, use the `short movie` tag. In general, a "show-in-show" would not qualify as standalone. For example, an anime has a cartoon show within it. If the show within was released as an OVA or movie, it would not be considered standalone.</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<name>Amaterasu Dis Grand Eydas Grees Fourth</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The main character of the story, Amaterasu is the emperor of the Amaterasu Kingdom Demesne, (AKD) which covers the entire planet of Delta Belune. His full name is Amaterasu dis Gran Grees Eidas IV (the 84th ruler of the Kingdom of Grees). "Dis" is a royal honorific that applies to men. "Mel" applies to women. Amaterasu is also the commander-in-chief of the Mirage Knights, which act as the emperor`s body guards and special forces. Amaterasu himself is considered Mirage no. A.
Amaterasu was born in J.C. 2020, to the queen of Grees, Amaterasu-no-Mikoto. In addition to his longevity and eternal youth, Amaterasu has a host of supernatural powers (the source of which will come to light as the story progresses). One of Amaterasu`s most unusual powers is his ability to not only change his physical appearance but to create additional bodies with a consciousness separate from his own, yet still connected to him. Two of these "projections" are Mel Rince (leader of the AKD`s Divers Guild) and Agari-no-Kimi (Lord of the East), both powerful divers in their own right.
Amaterasu is an albino with platinum hair and crimson eyes. His frame is so slight that he can easily be mistaken for female (his alter ego, Ladios Sop often is!). His fatima is Ballanche masterpiece #44 Lachesis. Amaterasu has not only superior headdliner skill and superior diver ability, but is also a genius mortar headd meight. The mortar headds of the Mirage Knights, the Mirage series, were all his designs. He designed his own mortar headd, the Knight of Gold, by request of Lachesis when she was still a child.
Though Amaterasu shows no emotions, he is a very sympathetic person. His desire for galactic peace is so strong, he is willing to go to war against the entire Joker galaxy in order to stop the endless battles being waged. It is this desire for peace that is the catalyst for much of what happens later in the story.</description>
