<name>military</name>
<description>The military, also known as the armed forces, are forces authorized and legally entitled to use deadly force so as to support the interests of the state and its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its citizens and the prosecution of war against foreign powers. The military may also have additional functions within a society, including construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding critical areas.

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

Since it isn`t possible to travel faster than light, most anime series involve some sort "sub-space travel mechanism" as a way to travel faster than light.</description>

<name>space opera</name>
<description>Space opera is a sub-genre of fiction that emphasizes romantic adventures in space. Space opera generally involves large-scale conflicts between opponents with powerful abilities and technology. The genre will often be melodramatic, sometimes playing music that can be nothing short of awesome. Warfare and a battle of wits are usually less emphasized, preferring romance (with exceptions, e.g. Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu). Some space operas tend to be formulaic and sometimes even prosaic, often employing very simple devices and somewhat obvious strategies. An example of this would be the infamous laws of physics in the Macross universe, in which the main male lead will hardly ever get hit in battle.</description>

<description>There is some intellectual battle between the characters. They each might attempt to discern what the other knows and/or could be planning. Then, rather than simply relying on the use of raw power, try to deduce an effective strategy to foil their opponent(s). The battle of wits can be in the center of the intrigue or just a side story.

<description>Reinhard was born into a poor noble family. He lived with his father and his older sister Annerose. His mother died when he was young so he knew very little about her. When Reinhard moved to a middle class suburban neighborhood, he met Siegfried Kircheis and they soon became inseparable friends. When his father sold Annerose to become Kaiser Friedrich IV`s concubine, Reinhard swore that he would overthrow the Goldenbaum dynasty to rescue his older sister. He left school to join the military academy and persuaded Kircheis to come along with him.</description>

Nicknamed the "Bewitching Eyes" for his http://anidb.net/t1065 [heterochromatic eyes], Reuenthal was a brilliant commander and was considered to be second only to Reinhard in terms of strategic ability. He was a close friend of fellow Fleet Admiral http://anidb.net/ch193 [Wolfgang Mittermeyer], the Supreme Fleet Commander and the other one of the Twin Pillars of the Goldenlöwe Dynasty. The two of them were some of Reinhard von Lohengramm`s earliest supporters against the Goldenbaum Dynasty and high nobles ruling the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [first Empire]. However, after complex scheming by various interests behind the scenes, Reuenthal ended up being forced into rising in rebellion against his Kaiser, only to fall in battle.
Fleet Admiral von Reuenthal had been regarded as one of the five best tacticians of that era, and also proved himself to be a capable administrator as the Governor-General of the occupied Alliance territories.

<description>Bernhard von Schneider was an Imperial commander who was most notable for his role as the leading adjutant, subordinate, and a close confidant of High Admiral http://anidb.net/ch202 [Willibald Joachim von Merkatz], serving him faithfully from at least the Battle of Astarte (796 UC) to the Battle of Shiva (801 UC). During the late Alliance–Imperial War, the Imperial Civil War, and the following standoff between the New Galactic Empire and the http://anidb.net/ch6227 [Iserlohn Republic], Schneider was essentially apolitical and was mainly loyal to High Admiral Merkatz, providing him with assistance and counseling.

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Flegel was a baron and therefore a high noble, and the nephew of Duke http://anidb.net/ch261 [Otto von Braunschweig]. He was involved in the imprisonment of then-Rear Admiral http://anidb.net/ch193 [Wolfgang Mittermeyer] in 795 UC, paying an interrogator to torture him and after this was unsuccessful attempting to beat him personally. His pride stung by Mittermeyer accusing him of cowardice in beating a manacled man, he released the admiral`s handcuffs to fight him fairly but was easily defeated by Mittermeyer and called for his companions to shoot his opponent. This was foiled by the personal intervention of Admiral http://anidb.net/ch1687 [Reinhard von Müsel] at the request of Rear Admiral http://anidb.net/ch194 [Oskar von Reuenthal].
Flegel cooperated with many high officers and nobles against http://anidb.net/ch186 [von Lohengramm]. In particular, he incited http://anidb.net/ch499 [Susanna von Benemünde] into plots to kill Reinhard or http://anidb.net/ch205 [his sister], all while being careful no definitive evidence could be traced back to himself. He was aboard http://anidb.net/ch1762 [Iserlohn Fortress], holding the rank of Vice Admiral under Fleet Admiral http://anidb.net/ch200 [Gregor von Mückenberger] who valued his political connections. Flegel accompanied von Mückenberger aboard http://anidb.net/ch82216 [his flagship] at the Fourth Battle of Tiamat.
Following the battle, Flegel returned to Odin in 796 UC and conspired with Braunschweig to ensure that Reinhard would die in his next campaign. It was his proposal to leak Imperial plans to http://anidb.net/ch6233 [Phezzan], correctly guessing that the information would be sold to the http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets Alliance].
Having been present at the formation of the http://anidb.net/ch6230 [Lippstadt League], Flegel served his uncle as a Vice Admiral during the Imperial Civil War and died in a mutiny after insisting his ship make a suicide charge. His last words were "Long live the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Empire]."

<description>Otto von Braunschweig was an Imperial Duke and the husband of Kaiser http://anidb.net/ch206 [Friedrich IV]`s daughter Princess Amarie, being among the most influential high nobles at court during the waning years of the Goldenbaum Dynasty. A major opponent of the upstart http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm], he stood for preserving the old order during the Imperial Civil War. Although he possessed much wealth and military might, Duke Braunschweig proved to be incompetent and came to be viewed as the personification of the decadence and decline of the Imperial nobility.
He was forced to commit suicide by his chief retainer shortly after the confederated aristocrat forces were defeated by Lohengramm.

<name>Yang Wenli</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Yang Wenli is one of two protagonists within the series. Like http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard], both of them share similar roles within their respective nations as famous national heroes renowned for their military skill. Compared to Reinhard, Yang is much more humble and dislikes his popularity as being a burden. Yang originally wanted to become a historian and only attended the Free Planets Defense Force Command Academy so he can get free education, while Reinhard relishes his fame and was ambitious to overthrow the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [empire].
At the start of the series, Yang has gained some fame as the "Hero of El Facil" for his exploits in the evacuation of the planet before Imperial occupation, and gains much more fame to become a national hero by the end of the first season. During the second season, he generally takes a lesser role compared to Reinhard, but returns in full force in third season before he is assassinated by members of the Terraist Church.
Yang was a mild-tempered person who lives on red tea, a genius tactician and strategist that exceeds even Reinhard. His weakness lies in his unwillingness to risk democracy by assuming more direct powers and responsibilities. Not willing to take on a bigger role or responsibility, he and Reinhard`s battle were never in equal footing and at same time handcuffing him from doing things that could change the scale of the power balance. He also openly respects Reinhard and considers him to be a true genius as Reinhard`s ability does not seem to confine in just military affairs and is able to act on what his mind tells him while Yang might be reluctant to do so if given same situation. He also agrees that benevolent autocracy is better and more efficient than corrupted democracy if social change is needed, and noted that if he was born in the empire, he would actually volunteer to serve under Reinhard despite his dislike of military. On the other hand, he was glad to be born in Free Planets as it gives him the freedom, and believes that while democracy is less efficient and can be slowed dramatically with corruption it nevertheless is better because it is less likely to be corrupted completely and no one has absolute power, because after all, a good and wise Emperor such as Reinhard doesn`t come along often.
The http://anidb.net/ch82015 [Hyperion] is the flagship of Yang Wenli`s fleet. It is retrofitted from a frontier security squadron flagship. It is lightly armed, possessing only 32 forward cannons which comprise its main armament. It possesses a large and spread out multi-level bridge with a large conference table commonly used for meetings by Admiral Yang and his staff, as well as a large tactical viewscreen used during battle to display fleet movements.

<description>Job Trunicht was an http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Alliance] politician and its penultimate head of state, leading what was widely perceived as an incompetent and corrupt administration, a symbol of the decline of http://anidb.net/ch1026 [Arle Heinessen]`s legacy. Though democratically elected, Job Trunicht used fear to maintain his power—fear of the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Galactic Empire], and fear of his own secret police, the murderous http://anidb.net/ch82359 [Patriotic Knights Corps]. He was simply out for his own personal power and survival, becoming involved in factional politics and not caring for the future of the Alliance, despite outwardly preaching the opposite.
Trunicht`s corruption was seen as one of the contributing factors to the fall of the Alliance and democracy to http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm]. After the defeat of the Alliance in Operation Ragnarök he took responsibility for the defeat and resigned, having surrendered the Alliance because his life was threatened by the Imperial Fleet. Following the complete subjugation of the Alliance during the Second Alliance–Imperial War, Trunicht made dealings with both the Church of Terra and the New Galactic Empire, ultimately betraying all of the factions that he once claimed loyalty to.
Trunicht was later shot by http://anidb.net/ch194 [Oskar von Reuenthal] shortly before the latter`s own death, after having insulted Kaiser Reinhard in their conversation.

He was overruled and imprisoned for voicing an apparent defeatist opinion.
He escaped from his imprisonment when Braunschweig had lost most of his support and was in imminent danger of capture. He disabused his lord of the possibility of alliance with http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm] or escape, and coerced his lord to commit suicide. Ansbach offered Reinhard von Lohengramm the body of Duke Braunschweig in an attempt to assassinate Lohengramm.

Despite being disillusioned, Ansbach had remained loyal to Braunschweig and his final words were of apology to his lord.
