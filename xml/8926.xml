<description>* Based on a miniature figure toyline for girls created by http://anidb.net/cr34240 [Spin Master] and http://anidb.net/cr10175 [Sega Toys].
The Candy Factory is a place where all Zoobles are born. Beyond that factory is a world called Candy Land, where all Zoobles live. The story revolves around the three main Zoobles: Chevy, a Cat Zooble with an Orange Flavour; Coron, a Rabbit Zooble with a Strawberry Milk Flavour; and Panky, a Panda Zooble with a Blueberry Yogurt Flavour. The three of them live in Candy Town, and they get into serious misadventures as they try to get in (and out of) trouble.
Note: The series was produced by Korean animation studio http://anidb.net/cr13577 [Dongwoo Animation] and began airing on Korean broadcasting station SBS on May 18, 2011. An official Japanese dub version began airing in Japan on http://anidb.net/cr804 [TV Tokyo] on February 5, 2012, replacing http://anidb.net/a7535 [Bakugan Battle Brawlers: Gundalian Invaders] in its initial timeslot.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<summary>Dancing Zoobles!: Chevy and Coron goes to Panky`s tree house and wakes him up as they have plans to go to the Rainbow Park together. However, after the three arrived at the park, Chevy and Panky are gonna drink the water from the fountain until they notice some Zoobles hiding behind the tree somehow scared. They then encounter three mysterious Zoobles called the Black Candies, which composed of Blacky, a Vanilla Caramel flavored Fox Zooble, Mikey, a Chocolate Mint flavored Fox Zooble and Cooper, a Chocolate Banana flavored Giraffe Zooble. The three claimed the fountain for their own and the only way to reclaim it is to Chevy and her friends win a dancing competition against them. But there is one problem: Coron and Panky doesn`t know how to dance well.
Go for it! Panky: Panky himself has a little problem crossing the pole. Because of this, Chevy and Coron consulted to Peel, a Cherry Flavored Bird Zooble to train him to be more assertive. But is this enough for him to be all active?</summary>
