<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="354131">This is recommended for Universal Century Gundam fans. Really, the values and themes presented in this will require advanced understanding of old shows from the 80s, but those whose souls are not bound by gravity will be well rewarded.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="173054">Mixes elements from many of the other Gundam anime out there. Definitely worth it for the amazing animation and mecha fights - serious kudos to the production cast. Though for my tastes, I didn`t like the main character [Kira Yamato is way better], and the whole `emo-powered` gundams was a huge turn-off. Get ready for a magical gundam universe - realism drops off quite a bit in this universe.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="134143">This is what you may call a work of art.
They applied the same concept art of Zeta Gundam series as well.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="236022">If you have think that Gundam image has been destroyed lately, this series must be the some fresh wind...
Good story, Good music, plot and character also... the best animation so far is the main key for this series victory. I think this is how Gundam should fight :D
It`s very recommended for Gundam lover, also mecha lover, sci-fi  lover.
I hope the ending won`t destroy whole show ...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="374795">Absolutely stunning. Just like fdt said, the level of detail is incredible. If you like the Gundam series, you can`t miss this one.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="391848">Sates my hunger for a good mecha and leaves me even hungrier for more.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="276125">Sunrise pulled all the budget into this project, and it paid dividends. The ending felt a little forced and anti-climatic, but overall the series was beautiful and entertaining, and a worthy entry into the already burgeoning UC timeline.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="357163">I`ve not watched anything from the Gundam series before. I`ve always thought them as a bit silly. But after watching the first episode of this ova, I`m completely blown away by the production quality. The characters, music, and visuals are all top notch. It doesn`t matter if you`re a mech fan or not. As long as you enjoy good movies, give Gundam Unicorn a go.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="421127">Just finished watching the final part of this and only I can only think of one way to describe it.  Epic.  The story, characters, animation, and soundtrack are all as close to perfection as one could ask for.  For me personally, I think this is easily the best Gundam series to date.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="296499">probably the best UC Gundam. Perfect animation, artwork, soundtrack and plot.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="426644">A must see for gundam fans. 
For those who like to see robots combat in space this is definitely for you.
For the others who new to this series I believe you should watch 
`Mobile Suit Gundam: Char`s Counterattack` before.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="253370">Words cannot describe how much this series has made me appreciate the Gundam genre.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="370286">BLEW MY MINDHOLE!

Good action, story, animation and awesome setpieces!

If you haven`t seen this then you sir... are wasting time!

Seriously stop reading and see it before you see a spoiler somewhere!

I dare say this is the best gundam ever made!

There I SAID IT! It`s out there and and I`m not taking it back!</recommendation>

Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>war</name>
<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<name>space opera</name>
<description>Space opera is a sub-genre of fiction that emphasizes romantic adventures in space. Space opera generally involves large-scale conflicts between opponents with powerful abilities and technology. The genre will often be melodramatic, sometimes playing music that can be nothing short of awesome. Warfare and a battle of wits are usually less emphasized, preferring romance (with exceptions, e.g. Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu). Some space operas tend to be formulaic and sometimes even prosaic, often employing very simple devices and somewhat obvious strategies. An example of this would be the infamous laws of physics in the Macross universe, in which the main male lead will hardly ever get hit in battle.</description>

<name>Super Robot Wars</name>
<description>Super Robot Wars is a series of tactical role-playing video games produced by Banpresto. The main feature of the franchise is having a story that crosses over several popular mecha anime, manga and video games, allowing characters and mecha from different titles to team up or battle one another. Due to the nature of crossover games and licensing involved, only a few games have been released outside Japan, and in English; early English-language games only feature Banpresto`s original characters and mecha, and a flagship installment were to never be released until 2016, with the English release of Super Robot Wars V in Southeast Asian countries. The franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2016.

<description>The unified world government that launched the space settlement program and now rules over both Earth and the space colonies. Its main decision-making body is the Earth Federation Assembly, which meets occasionally to pass new legislation.
Though not as cruel and aggressive as the Principality of Zeon`s leaders, the bureaucrats who rule over the Earth Federation are corrupt, weak-willed, and insensitive to the space colonists` desire for independence. After the One Year War, the Federation decides to concentrate its energies on reconstructing Earth instead of the space colonies, further increasing political tensions.</description>

The Titans are initially headquartered at the Gryps space colony, but as they gain control over the regular Federation Forces and form an alliance with the Republic of Zeon, they also take over Luna II and the Gate of Zedan.</description>

<description>The Marasai is an improved version of the Hizack, developed by Anaheim Electronics and offered to the Titans as a diplomatic gesture. Thanks to its lightweight Gundarium alloy armour, the Marasai has greater propellant capacity than the Hizack, and its improved rocket engines make it faster as well. Most importantly, its higher power output enables it to drive two types of beam weapons simultaneously. While it never fully replaces the Hizack in the Titans ranks, this versatile mobile suit is often assigned to novice pilots.</description>

<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Haro is the mechanical mascot of the Gundam science fiction anime metaseries, and is the only character that appears in more than one timeline.
The original Haro is a little robot companion built by the main character Amuro Ray. It is a cute testament to Amuro`s exceptional talent for machines. Haro`s features include a limited range of speech, and the ability to hover (in environments with atmosphere and low gravity) by flapping its ear-like appendage coverings. Haro can usually be found rolling behind Amuro`s next door neighbor Frau Bow. The ability to detect brain waves is also one of Haro`s functions; in one of the episodes, Haro actually claimed that the brain wave of Amuro was lowered/different.
In Zeta Gundam, a mass-produced Mk-II version of Haro ends up in the hands of that series` main protagonist Kamille Bidan, who initially suspects it to be the original. He repairs the robot, only to have it constantly address him as Amuro.
During the events of Char`s Counterattack, Amuro gives a "third-generation" Haro to Hathaway, the son of his captain Bright Noa.
Haro continues to permeate the Gundam franchise, having appeared in Gundam SEED as Lacus Clyne`s multi-colored horde of simple-speech robot pets, built for her by Athrun Zala. These Haros are roughly 1/4 the size of their Universal Century counterparts and are similar in function, however a few possess certain abilities such as unlocking doors. Lacus`s favorite Haro is a pink machine that she refers to as "Pink-Chan" (often translated as "Mr. Pink" or "Pinky"). Another notable Haro in Lacus`s collection is "Navy-Chan", a navy blue robot on which she paints a mustache bearing a distinct resemblance the facial ornament of the ∀ Gundam of the CC (正歴 Seireki) calendar system. The rest of Lacus` Haros have been seen in yellow, orange, blue, green, and black. The parody comic Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Club Yonkoma states that Athrun has built a total of 35 Haros for Lacus.
In Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Celestial Being had produced unknown numbers of Haros as an assistant of daily maintenance works. Currently at least 6 unique Haros have appeared in the animation production. The Haros in the series took much more maintenance and combat role than any other series` counterpart, usually seeing them operating with various machines, including mobile weapons.</description>

After the fight with Chara Soon in U.C.0089.1.17, one of the clones survived and was retrieved by an MS pod. She was then sold into sex slavery, and from then on she worked as a prostitute. Before coming under the protection of Suberoa, she experienced countless pregnancies and abortions and her body is scarred by the abuse of her customers. During an examination on board Nahal Argama when she was captured, it was ascertained that she cannot bear children anymore.

<description>The mysterious leader of the Neo Zeon remnant forces who is described as the "2nd coming of Char". Like Char Aznable, he is a blonde man whose face is hidden behind a mask, and he wears a red uniform and pilots a red mobile suit. Similar to Char, he holds the Neo Zeon remnants together with his high charisma. Whether the name is an alias is unspecified. On the contrary, his name holds the meaning of "stark naked"(or fully exposed) although it could easily be reference to a full frontal assault. He plays around Banagher and the others with his puzzling speech and behaviour. He is fighting against the Earth Federation for "the secret" of the foundation of the Universal Century.
His face and tone closely resemble Char`s. Nahel Argama`s captain Otto, who watched Char`s archived recordings, remarked that the voice is just like it. He is later revealed to be a cyber NewType who was genetically altered to resemble the missing-in-action Char Aznable. His memories were then implanted from the psycho frame of one of the Mobile suits previously piloted by Char (possibly Sazabi).</description>

<description>A pure white MS produced by the "UC Project," part of the Federation Space Force`s reorganization plan. The entire movable frame of this experimental machine forms a psycoframe, and its responsiveness is extremely high. It also incorporates a special "Laplace Program" OS and a system known as "NT-D (Newtype Drive, called Newtype Destroyer System by Full Frontal)." When NT-D is activated, the internal frame expands and the entire figure is transformed. In the process, the armor separates along its seams, and slides are released. A red glow can be seen where the internal frame is exposed by the gaps in the armor, and this is believed to be a psycoframe luminescence phenomenon. The machine`s performance, in particular its mobility, is dramatically increased when NT-D is active. In its normal mode, it sports a head resembling that of mass-produced MS like the GM. Equiped with beam magnum, hyper bazooka, NT-D type shield, four beam saber and beam gatling gun as an option.</description>

<description>The Unicorn`s appearance when the `NT-D` system is activated. In this form, the psycoframe built into the entire body`s movable frame reads the pilot`s thoughts (psycowaves) and directly influences the unit`s movements. In other words, the MS can ultimately be controlled by thought alone. However, when compared to one`s idea of how a human body works, the stress of gravity on a 20 meter MS (more than 10 times the size) is extraordinary. Aided by the psycommu, the pilot`s mind can only endure about five minutes of operation, after which a limiter is believed to activate, returning the MS to normal Unicorn form. Furthermore, the system activates not according to the pilot`s discretion, but automatically when certain conditions, as yet unexplained, are met. In this mode, the mobile suit becomes taller and its head transforms to one having standard Gundam features.</description>

<description>The Londo Bell is the Earth Federation`s special forces unit in during the U.C. 0090s. Commanded by veteran Bright Noa, with its mobile suit combat squads led by ace pilot Amuro Ray, the Londo Bell is designed as an elite unit to be dispatched in the event of a major insurgency. The Londo Bell`s personnel is composed of ex-AEUG and ex-Karaba members, many of whom served under Bright previously. Because so many of these people fought the Titans, they do their best to carry out their missions in a far more humane and civilized manner than the Titans. Prior to the rise of the second Neo Zeon movement, this task force spends most of its time inspecting colonies for remnant Zeon supporters. Unfortunately, they fail to pick up on the new Neo Zeon threat due to the task force being greatly understaffed.
In U.C. 0093, former Zeon officer/AEUG member Char Aznable returns, after missing-in-action following the Gryps Conflict. After occupying the refugee colony Sweetwater without firing a single shot, he publicly declares himself the new leader of Neo Zeon and war against the Earth. As a countermeasure, the Federation rapidly increases the size of the Londo Bell in anticipation of the second Neo Zeon movement, which begins in March U.C. 0093. During this conflict, the Londo Bell consists of three Clop-class cruisers: the Ra Zyme, the Ra Kiem and the Ra Chutter, along with the flagship Ra Cailum. Its mobile suit squadrons consists of 18 RGM-89 Jegans, a RGZ-91 Re-GZ (Refined Gundam Zeta) and Amuro`s personal unit, the RX-93 Nu Gundam. The Londo Bell saw extensive action against Char`s Neo Zeon, as chronicled in the full-length animated film Mobile Suit Gundam: Char`s Counterattack, and were the primary Federation combatants of the war.
By U.C. 0096, as told in the on-going serial novel Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn, the Londo Bell re-commissions the AEUG`s Nahel Argama battleship, the same vessel used during the first Neo Zeon movement. The Nahel Argama is equipped with 8 new RGZ-95 ReZELs and 5 Jegans. The task force`s fleet size, however, is currently unknown, though it is likely larger following the second Neo Zeon movement.</description>

<description>In U.C. 0093, Zeon Zum Deikun`s son, Casval Rem Deikun (aka Zeon`s legendary ace, Char Aznable, the "Red Comet"), created a second Neo Zeon. This movement was founded under the ceremonial goal of "speeding up" the space migration of all of humanity, so the theoretical evolution of humanity into Newtypes could be realised. Char`s plan involved a series of massive asteroid drops against the Earth, ultimately leading to an eternal nuclear winter, rendering the planet uninhabitable. The final collision attempt was to involve the Axis asteroid, headquarters of the previous Neo Zeon movement. The plan was ultimately foiled by the Federation`s Londo Bell taskforce, headed by Bright Noa, and his old adversary from the One Year War, Amuro Ray, when Amuro managed to push the falling Axis away, sacrificing himself and killing Char in the process (while their deaths were never officially confirmed in the movie, their deaths are confirmed in the novelization of Char`s Counterattack). Char`s loss of the second Neo Zeon movement effectively ended the Zeon/Neo Zeon movement.
In U.C. 0100, the Republic of Zeon officially rejoined the Earth Federation.</description>

<description>Anaheim Electronics is a fictional civilian manufacturing company that appeared in the Universal Century timeline of the Gundam anime metaseries. The company appeared first in Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam(aired in 1985) as the main funder, as well as the main military supplier and manufacturer of the faction AEUG. However, the company also design and manufacture weapons for both the Earth Federation, its elite faction Titans, enemy of the AEUG, and third party faction Axis Zeon, which in turn became the enemies of the AEUG later in the series until the end of the sequel, Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ(aired in 1986). The company continues its manufacturing contracts in Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ and Mobile Suit Gundam: Char`s Counterattack(aired in 1988), where its weapons are always seen in both sides of the conflicting factions. In the novel, Gundam Sentinel(serialized in 1989), which happens between the conflicts of the anime series Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam and Mobile suit Gundam ZZ, Anaheim Electronics became the main contractor of the Earth Federation of its new mass-production units like Nero and the Z Plus series for the Task Force alpha and also provided prototype units such as S Gundam as a testbed for the Federation. The Gundam Sentinel`s Model Graphix special edition, Gundam Wars III, the battle of real Gundam in turn gave a detail analysis of the company and retconned the production and testing history. The company`s earlier history was then told in the anime Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory(OVA first released in 1991), where it first became the contract manufacturer of the Earth Federation. In December 2003, celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the Gundam metaseries, a book Anaheim Journal was released, disguised as a monthly magazine published by Anaheim Electronics in UC0100. The company also appeared in the comic Silhouette Formula 91, and later in the anime Mobile Suit V Gundam.
Based on the Moon, Anaheim Electronics originally produced a wide range of technological applications from consumer electronics to battleships and even space colonies. Their service do not end at electronic goods, according to Anaheim Journal, they also have departments providing cosmetics, vacation travelling plans (with their own resort space colonies) and credit cards, ultimately fitting the definition of a zaibatsu. Upon the end of the One Year War, Anaheim was able to acquire the assets and personnel of the Zeonic Corporation - a mobile suit manufacturing firm of the defeated Principality of Zeon. This merger enabled Anaheim Electronics to enter the lucrative business of mobile suit production. As such, the firm was contracted by the Earth Federation to become its principal mobile suit provider until the end of the second Neo Zeon movement.
Anaheim Electronics is known for its profit-oriented mindset - creating advanced mobile weapons for any faction that would be willing to pay, then selling the same technology to the former`s enemy. During the rise of the oppressive Titans taskforce, Anaheim funded the AEUG and gave it access to their technology and safe shelter as the Titans restricted their trading engagements, despite the Earth Federation Forces and the Titans being their primary customer. Later, the company would service contracts from the remnants of the Principality of Zeon such as Axis and Neo Zeon. According to GundamOfficials, this is due to the gigantic company structure. With several development departments, each departments can be contracted by different factions without needing to notify the main executive board. This policy is simply adopted to minimize the companies overall responsibility; after the main battle, they can always just apply the penalty on a single department`s head instead of making the whole company suffer.
In the story of Silhouette Formula 91, after U.C. 0123, Anaheim Electronics lost its contract bid with the EFF to SNRI`s new miniaturized mobile suit designs, which were cheaper, more versatile and higher in performance. Anaheim Electronics had to maintain its low profile until U.C. 0153, and financially supported League Militaire in secrecy defending Earth from Zanscare Empire.
According to the official timeline, Anaheim Electronics remains as the main manufacturer of mobile suits in the Earth Sphere until the Earth Federation itself was disbanded in the U.C. 0200s, although its monopoly in the field was literally obliterated since the second Universal Century with the entrance of the Federation-backed competitor SNRI.

Rejoining the Federation, Amuro was assigned to the Londo Bell unit, which patrols the space colonies for signs of rebellion. As a result, this veteran pilot now finds himself on the frontlines of the new struggle against his longtime rival Char Aznable. Amuro is now a confident adult, with no trace of his old fears and insecurities, but his encounters with Char show that he still retains the hot temper of his teenage years.

<description>A modified and improved version of the original MS-06D Zaku Desert Type, the MS-06D Desert Zaku features better power output, external propellant tanks on its backpack to carry extra thruster fuel, and additional shields and dust filters on its joints to facilitate burying the mobile suit under the sand for ambushes. The Desert Zaku can also be fitted with a pair of jet skis on its feet, making it easy to glide at high speed across the desert sand. Though normally used by Zeon remnants led by "Desert" Rommel in North Africa in U.C. 0088, a few Desert Zakus also land in the hands of the African Liberation Front, with one unit operating as part of their "Blue Team" and painted in their distinctive light-blue-on-blue colors. Zeon remnants continue to make use of the Desert Zaku as late as U.C. 0096 during an attack on Australia`s Torrington Base.

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>One of the last evolutions of the old Principality of Zeon`s MS-09 Dom series, the MS-09G Dwadge (not to be confused with the MS-10 Pezun Dowadge of Zeon`s "Pezun Project") continues to be used for many years after the One Year War. By the time of the First Neo Zeon War in U.C. 0088, the Dwadge is operated by several parties, including the new Neo Zeon military, old African-based Zeon remnants from the One Year War, and the civilian African Liberation Front. Although quite similar to its predecessor, the Dwadge is an improvement over the well-proven and successful Dom in that it also mounts four vulcan guns in the head and carries an external propellant tank on its backpack, thus extending the operational time for using the Dwadge`s ground-skimming hovering jets. The Dwadge remains in use with Zeon remnants as late as U.C. 0096 during an attack on Australia`s Torrington Base.

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>A new amphibious combat mobile suit designed and built by the Earth Federation Forces, the RMS-192M Zaku Mariner is an improved descendant of the old Principality of Zeon`s MS-06M Zaku Marine Type used in the One Year War. Armed with a total of 14 SUBROC (SUBmarine ROCket) launchers in its shoulders and backpack, as well as a magnet harken shocking cable weapon for melee combat, and a handheld spray missile gun, the Zaku Mariner packs more firepower than its Zaku Marine Type predecessor. In addition to being a better performer in terms of power, the backpack can be ejected in order for the Mariner to go ashore and conduct limited ground combat (a similar feature is also utilized by the later Neo Zeon AMS-129M Zee Zulu). However, the Federation Forces never get to deploy these units; instead, they fall into the hands of Neo Zeon, who acquire them with the capture of several Federation bases following their Earth invasion during the First Neo Zeon War in U.C. 0088. Zeon remnants also make use of the Zaku Mariner during an attack on Australia`s Torrington Base in U.C. 0096.

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>As Neo Zeon launches its invasion of Earth during the First Neo Zeon War in U.C. 0088, they employ several new mobile suit designs built for terrestrial combat. One of these units is the AMX-109 Capule, which is an amphibious mobile suit based loosely on the old Principality of Zeon`s MSM-03 Gogg from the One Year War. Armed with eight missile launchers, a sonic blast weapon in its waist, and a laser beam "eye" on its small, flat head, this small mobile suit packs an enormous amount of firepower for its size, all cooled by a hydro-cooling system. The Capule`s arms can fold up inside its main body and its legs can fold back, turning the mobile suit into a mobile armor-like form that is faster and more streamlined when moving underwater. In its mobile armor mode, the Capule can also move along the water`s surface in a fashion similar to a hovercraft. However, the Capule seems to have lost many of the lessons learned by the Principality of Zeon during its amphibious mobile suit development during the One Year War. As a result, the Capule proves to be an inefficient design and is highly unpopular with its pilots - apparently Spacenoids have forgotten how to build ocean-going mobile suits for use on Earth. The Capule remains in use with Zeon remnants and participates in attacks on the Federation capital Dakar and Australia`s Torrington Base in U.C. 0096.

<summary>A Neo-Zeon remnant group called the "Sleeves" travels to Side 4`s Industrial 7 colony, so that its captain, Zinnerman, can receive a "key" to something known as "Laplace`s Box" from Vist Foundation leader Cardeas Vist. The item is said to be capable of either restoring the future or destroying the world. Audrey Burne seeks to meet Vist first and convince him not to turn over Laplace`s Box, believing the Sleeves will use it to start another war. Along the way, she is rescued by 16-year-old student Banagher Links, who agrees to take her to Vist. Meanwhile, a battle breaks out between the Federation`s Londo Bell taskforce and the Sleeves. As the collateral damage rises, the colony is evacuated. Amidst the chaos, Banagher discovers the fatally-wounded Cardeas Vist in the cockpit of the Unicorn Gundam. Before his death, Vist entrusts the Gundam to Banagher, who realizes that Vist is his father. Banagher then launches in the Unicorn and confronts the Sleeves` elite pilot, Marida Cruz, who is piloting the Kshatriya.

<summary>The transformed Unicorn Gundam overpowers the Kshatriya and Marida is ordered to retreat. The Unicorn is picked up by the Londo Bell ship Nahel Argama. Banagher is questioned by Daguza Mackle about how he came to possess the Unicorn Gundam but is interrupted by the Sleeves` surprise attack. Full Frontal, the leader of Neo Zeon, demands that the Nahel Argama hand over any items related to Laplace`s Box, including the Unicorn. Daguza tries to ensure safe passage by holding Audrey - revealed to be Zeon Princess Mineva Lao Zabi - hostage, but Frontal refuses to accept they have the real Mineva. With no other choice, Banagher sorties in the Unicorn against the Sinanju; he fights well, but is captured when blindsided by the Kshatriya. Banagher is taken to meet Frontal at the Sleeves asteroid base of Palau.
After discussing the nature of Zeon with Marida, who is placed in charge of watching over Banagher, a crew member from the Nahel Argama disguised as a bum bumps into Banagher and passes him a map and a transmitter, telling him to get to the 14th space gate or risk being killed in the coming battle. Banagher laments over how the colony will become a battlefield soon.

<summary>The Earth Federation and ECOAS execute their assault on Palau, with the intention of rescuing Banagher and the Unicorn. Saboteurs destroy Palau`s connecting bridges, while the Nahel Argama unleashes its Hyper-Mega Particle Cannon, pushing the asteroids towards each other to damage much of the Sleeves` forces. Any Sleeves unit getting out is ambushed by ECOAS units hiding in the rocks. Riddhe springs Audrey from detention so they can go to Earth and talk to his father, Ronan, but not before trying to convince a surprised Micott about their intentions. Banagher finds the Unicorn Gundam and tries to escape, defeating Marida in the process. She is eventually captured and Alberto Vist is allowed to escort her to an Anaheim Electronics facility on Earth.
Banagher and Daguza proceed to the remains of Laplace with the intention of activating Laplace`s Box, but hear the original broadcast of the Earth Federation establishment ceremony. The Sleeves are not far behind and the EFSF/ECOAS units fight them. The Sinanju appears and Daguza sacrifices his life to buy Banagher some time to activate the Unicorn`s Destroy Mode. The fight sheds parts of the Laplace colony and sends them into the atmosphere. Banagher continues to pursue Full Frontal during the reentry, but a beam magnum shot meant for the Sinanju hits Gilboa Sant instead. As Banagher enters the atmosphere, Audrey arrives at the Marcenas estate.

<summary>The Zeon Remnant forces attack the Federation Capitol Building at Dakar in a feint operation to allow the Garencieres to descend to Earth safely. Banagher is revealed to have been rescued from death by landing on the Garencieres mid-descent. Marida is transported to a Federation facility in North America, where Martha Vist Carbine manipulates her using the wreck of an old Mass-Production Qubeley, which she had piloted in the past. Audrey is held at the Marcenas estate. Riddhe escapes after his father, Ronan, tells him the truth about Laplace`s Box. Audrey briefly escapes captivity long enough to have a insightful conversation with an old man in a local diner, which strengthens her resolve. Bright Noa is ordered to take Riddhe on board the Ra Cailum under his command, as well as capture the Garencieres.
After being called in from around the world, the Zeon Remnant forces band together and assault Torrington Base en masse. The Shamblo`s pilot, Loni Garvey, falls victim to the malfunctioning on-board psycommu system, becoming a channel for her dead father`s bloodlust and begins indiscriminately massacring the population of a local city, despite being ordered to avoid causing collateral damage. Banagher, appalled by the resulting destruction, confronts Zinnerman about his hypocritical rationalizing of the situation and flies out in the Unicorn Gundam to put a stop to Loni`s rampage. After failing to reason with her, he activates the NT-D in a last-ditch effort to stop her without resorting to lethal force. Incensed by Banagher`s refusal to kill Loni, Riddhe decides to kill her himself, much to Banagher`s dismay, and orders him at gunpoint to hand over the Unicorn Gundam according to Captain Bright`s orders. As he threatens Banagher, the two witness a mysterious black-colored Unicorn Gundam being dropped into the battlefield.

In explaining the takeover, Full Frontal says it was an opportunity to finally open Laplace`s Box, reveals his memories of the events of Char`s Counterattack and his reasons for continuing to oppose the Earth Federation; implying very strongly that he is in fact Char Aznable. He leaves Angelo in charge of the vessel as it heads back to Industrial 7 - where the last clue leads to - along with the Rewloola.
A group of crewmen send out an SOS prompting the Federation`s Luna II base to send a Salamis cruiser in pursuit. Captain Otto defies Angelo`s orders to destroy the warship, breaking up the arrangement. An ECOAS team led by Conroy Haagensen assaults the Nahel Argama and gradually fights the Neo-Zeon troops back to the MS hangar deck. Banagher activates the Unicorn to aid in the attack, but Full Frontal faces him and threatens him with death if he doesn`t join the Neo-Zeon`s cause, since Mineva already knows where the Box is. With Mineva`s help, Marida reactivates the Kshatriya to prevent Angelo from destroying the Nahel Argama but declares that they aren`t supporting Full Frontal’s plan to use the Box to launch another war with the Federation. As Marida seeks Zinnerman`s permission to fight the Sleeves, he decides to finally let her go and live her own life. Angelo and Full Frontal fly back to the Rewloola in Angelo`s Rozen Zulu.
Back on Earth, Martha Vist threatens Bright Noa and Londo Bell with being left out of the pursuit operation if they do not co-operate with her. She also barges into a meeting of Ronan Marcenas and several EFSF politicians to announce her intentions to prevent the Box`s opening.
Upon entering the region near Industrial 7, Banagher flies out in the Full Armor Unicorn Gundam to get closer to opening the Box. A surprise awaits him though - the Unicorn Banshee Norn, piloted by Riddhe Marcenas, who was earlier briefed by Alberto Vist about the origins of the Vist Foundation.

<summary>After neutralizing the Delta Plus, the newly-arrived Banshee captures the Unicorn and returns it to the Ra Cailum, where Riddhe encounters and attempts to question Alberto Vist of Anaheim Electronics` motives, only to be ignored. Meanwhile, on the Garuda, Martha requests Mineva`s assistance to coerce Banagher`s cooperation in disclosing the location of Laplace`s Box. On the Ra Cailum, Bright speaks with Banagher and comes to terms with the latter`s actions, before learning of the Federation`s covert deployment of the new Dogosse Gier-class battleship General Revil. He sends orders to the Nahel Argama, instructing them to rendezvous with the Garencieres. The Tri-Stars, Riddhe, Marida and Banagher are assigned to provide cover while the Unicorn Gundam is transferred back to the Garuda. However, combat between the Garuda and Garencieres` forces breaks out, and in the ensuing chaos, Banagher restrains the Banshee long enough for Zimmerman to board the Garuda. Riddhe enters the Garuda`s rear docking bay and confronts Anaheim staff to rescue Mineva, but before he can do so, Zimmerman begins firing on them. Mineva takes advantage of the distraction to reach Zimmerman, who gives her a parachute. An exploding Anksha damages the docking bay and incapacitates Zimmerman. Riddhe pleads with Mineva to no avail; she leaps off the Garuda and is caught by Banagher, who activates the Unicorn`s NT-D system. After he brings Mineva to the Garencieres, Banagher forces the Banshee into the Garuda hangar. Marida identifies the Delta Plus as a Gundam and decimates it with the Banshee`s Armed Armor VN claw. Having regained consciousness, Zimmerman reaches out to Marida and implores that she return to the Garencieres. Realizing her original identity, Marida falls out of the Banshee`s cockpit unconscious.
The Garencieres undergoes the next phase of its mission and attempts to link with the Nahel Argama as per the original mission. However, an engine malfunction causes the ship to fall out of its designated trajectory. Despite this, the Nahel Argama fires its tow cable, which is caught by the Unicorn; the forces exerted on the machine threaten to pull it apart. The spirits of Daguza Mackle and Gilboa Sant appear, resulting in the Unicorn`s psycoframe producing a green luminescence, helping the Garencieres achieve orbit. Both ships find themselves under heavy fire from the General Revil. Flast believes that this was orchestrated by the Federation, but Mineva notes that the Federation attack patterns imply their intent on destroying the Garencieres and the Nahel Argama. Banagher attempts to engage the forces, but the Unicorn has exhausted its fuel supply. Angelo Sauper and his YAMS-132 Rozen Zulu appears and lays waste to the Federation mobile suits. He buys enough time for Full Frontal to head straight for the Revil and open fire with his rocket bazooka.
