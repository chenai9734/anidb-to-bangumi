<description>Eighty years have passed on Earth since the events chronicled in "Macross: Do you Remember Love?" The descendants of the Zentraedi/Meltrandi conflict have established a new society with the people of Earth and conflict with the Zentraedi is just a distant memory...
But when alien invaders identified as renegade Zentraedi threaten this uneasy alliance, the Super Dimensional Fortress Macross must resurrect itself after generations of inactivity to fight against the enemy forces. Hibiki Kanzazi, an investigative reporter for Scramble News Network (SNN), is caught up in the battle when he inadvertently allies himself with Ishtar, an enigmatic Zentraedi princess.
Enlisting the help of spirited Valkyrie pilot Silvie Gena, Hibiki rushes to save Ishtar from imminent "reprogramming" by hostile Zentraedi. Silvie and Hibiki must also broadcast the truth about Zentraedi invasion and convince the powerful military complex U.N. Spacey to reactivate the Macross fortress and defend Earth one last time.</description>

<name>military</name>
<description>The military, also known as the armed forces, are forces authorized and legally entitled to use deadly force so as to support the interests of the state and its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its citizens and the prosecution of war against foreign powers. The military may also have additional functions within a society, including construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding critical areas.

<name>air force</name>
<description>An air force, also known in some countries as an air army or air corps, is in the broadest sense, the national military organization that primarily conducts aerial warfare. More specifically, it is the branch of a nation`s armed services that is responsible for aerial warfare as distinct from an army, navy or other branch. Typically, air forces are responsible for gaining control of the air, carrying out strategic-bombing missions and providing support to surface forces.
The term "air force" may also refer to a tactical air force or numbered air force, which is an operational formation within a national air force. Air forces typically consist of a combination of fighters, bombers, helicopters, transport planes and other aircraft.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>post-apocalyptic</name>
<description>An anime that takes place on future Earth (or it could be an alternative universe) after a major cataclysm has occurred. World War III, an alien invasion, plague, global warming or some other general disaster are common themes to build a post-apocalyptic world upon, where the effects were severe enough that mankind barely survived.
The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologised). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in an agrarian, non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of technology remain. There is a considerable degree of blurring between post-apocalyptic fiction and that which deals with false utopias or dystopian societies.</description>

<description>Fictional languages are intended to be the languages of a fictional world and are often designed with the intent of giving more depth and an appearance of plausibility to the fictional worlds with which they are associated, and to have their characters communicate in a fashion which is both alien and dislocated.
Some of these languages, e.g. in worlds of fantasy fiction, alternative universes, Earth`s future, or alternate history, are presented as distorted versions or dialects of modern English or other natural language, while others are independently designed conlangs.
A fictional language often has the least amount of grammar and vocabulary possible, and rarely extends beyond the absolutely necessary. At the same time, some others have developed languages in detail for their own sake, such as J. R. R. Tolkien`s Quenya and Sindarin and Star Trek`s Klingon language which exist as functioning, usable languages. Here "fictional" can be a misnomer.</description>

<description>Space opera is a sub-genre of fiction that emphasizes romantic adventures in space. Space opera generally involves large-scale conflicts between opponents with powerful abilities and technology. The genre will often be melodramatic, sometimes playing music that can be nothing short of awesome. Warfare and a battle of wits are usually less emphasized, preferring romance (with exceptions, e.g. Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu). Some space operas tend to be formulaic and sometimes even prosaic, often employing very simple devices and somewhat obvious strategies. An example of this would be the infamous laws of physics in the Macross universe, in which the main male lead will hardly ever get hit in battle.</description>

<description>The power of love is not only the strongest power known to mankind, it is the strongest power in the universe. The power of love conquers all things. It makes people cry, it makes people laugh, it can make them sing and occasionally it even brings dead people back to life, just so.
More so than the power of friendship, the power of true love gives boundless strength and resolution; by the power of love every hardship can be overcome, every issue can be resolved and it does make people resistant to food poisoning (caused by the bad cooking of their loved ones). Even the big bad evil doesn`t stand a chance against the power of true love and often ends up redeemed.
Even when the power of love is not literally and directly responsible, the scene is often set so that the audience is left with the impression that it was "really responsible".</description>

<description>For thousands of millennia, an ancient war raged across the Milky Way Galaxy unbeknownst to the human race. In July 1999, that war came to humanity`s doorstep when a super-light-velocity spaceship crash-landed on Earth. The United Nations commences an investigation of the crash site located on South Ataria Island in the North Pacific Ocean. The spacecraft is given the code name Alien StarShip-1 (ASS-1) and investigations in the months following the crash uncover startling discoveries. Giant aliens, some five times the size of a human, crewed the craft which is revealed to be a warship; a Gun Destroyer from a faction called the Supervision Army. Most important of any discovery found in the alien spacecraft is the advanced technology contained within it. Given the name "OverTechnology," the United Nations Government (U.N.G) coordinates research quickly to understand it.
In 2001, several countries including Japan, United States, Russia, Germany, Britain, and France collaborate to establish an alien technology research institute called OTEC. Less than a year later, the OTEC commences a project to restore and reconstruct the ASS-1 to be commissioned as a capital ship for the newly formed United Nations Government. From February 2001 forward, the spacecraft is designated as the SDF-1; Super-Dimension-Fortress-1. Incredible advances are made from the research including the thermonuclear reaction system used to power the craft, the gravity control system, the space fold system for traveling faster-than-light and the super-dimension-energy cannons, the main weapon of the SDF-1. These technologies are adapted quickly and soon OverTechnology is being utilized in dozens of industries, notably super-small-scale thermonuclear reactors and the development of thermonuclear reaction bombs. Despite these unprecedented leaps of progress, many problems arise and threaten to undermine the launch of the SDF-1.
Originally set to launch in 2006, civil unrest abroad and the outbreak of the Anti-Unification Wars slows the SDF-1 restoration project. Eventually, the "UN Wars" cease on January 20th 2007 and the SDF-1 is rescheduled for launch in February 2009. It is the day of the launching ceremony that the opposing faction of the ancient war tracks the residual energies left by the ASS-1`s space fold and follow it to the Sol system. The newly christened SDF-1 Macross, armed with a heretofore undiscovered automated defense system, activates in response to the approaching enemy forces known as the Zentradi. The main cannon of the SDF-1 Macross fires from the surface of the Earth and destroys two Zentradi ships some 280,000 km out in space. The remaining Zentradi retaliate and intense fighting ensues. In an attempt to maneuver and regain the initiative, Captain http://anidb.net/ch10507 [Bruno J. Global] activates the space fold system to transport the SDF-1 Macross into Lunar orbit. Due to limited human understanding of the space fold system and improper instrumentation, the SDF-1 Macross folds far beyond the Moon, transporting the ship and much of the surrounding surface of South Ataria Island out past Pluto. This single engagement initiates the beginning of Space War I between the UN Spacy and the Zentradi.Over the length of more than a year during which Space War I is fought, the SDF-1 Macross travels from the outskirts of the Sol system back to Earth, fighting the forces of the Zentradi. The Zentradi are determined to capture the vessel, obsessed with the secrets of the ship`s obvious reconstruction and reaction weapons. This advantage allows the Macross to effectively use it`s formidable defenses, thwarting many attempts to be captured by the enemy. After Space War I ends on March 10th 2010, the Macross landing site is chosen as home for the reconstruction of Macross City. The Macross takes part in one more major engagement against rogue Zentradi Kamjin Kravshera`s forces during the Defensive Battle of Macross City in January 2012. Despite extensive damage following the battle, the Macross is repaired and undergoes a major refit. To this day, the Macross remains the home of the U.N. Military Command Center and is berthed in Macross City on Earth.

<description>The largest conventional Zentradi warship seen in Space War I, a Nupetiet-Vergnitzs Class vessel was the lead warship of the Bodol Zer Main Fleet`s 67th Glruimual class branch http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] (Adoclass) Fleet. A medium-scale fleet command battleship, the original design for this class of vessel was completed during development competitions in the early years of the Schism War. Over four kilometers in length, these ships are bristling with numerous weapon emplacements and carry a large complement of Zentradi mecha.
http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai Kridanik], the Zentradi in command of the Nupetiet-Vergnitzs, was on a search and destroy mission to find Supervision Army survivors when his fleet came upon residual traces of a Supervision Army gun destroyer`s defold reaction some ten light years away from Earth. The gun destroyer was naturally the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] and http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] led his fleet in an operation to intercept it. When the gun destroyer was found completely reconstructed, http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] led many relentless missions to capture the ship, including a daring operation using his own Nupetiet-Vergnitzs vessel as bait.Though http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai]`s Nupetiet-Vergnitzs was damaged repeatedly during Space War I, the ship remained fully operational during the war and even survived battle against the Bodol Zer Main Fleet. Repaired following the end of the war, the vessel was re-commissioned thereafter and became the first battleship of the New United Nations Forces in December 2012.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/nupetiet-vergnitzs.htm</description>

Another product of the war machines used during the ancient Schism War of the old Galactic Empire, the Quiltra-Queleual serves the role of a planetary assault ship. More than any of the other Zentradi capital ships, this vessel devotes the vast majority of internal volume to mecha bays and hangars for battle pods, fighters and re-entry craft. The ship features several launching hatches for efficient deployment including a large re-entry pod hatch. While not specifically designed for ship-to-ship combat, the Quiltra-Queleual still features a moderate number of anti-ship and anti-fighter weapons for attack and defense.

<description>The ARMD Class vessels were designed as space carriers for variable fighters and other U.N.S. spacecraft. The ARMD began construction in April 2003 at the Lagrange Point 5 manufacturing station. The first two carriers ARMD-01 and ARMD-02 were commissioned in July 2008 and October 2008 respectively and were opertaional prior to Space War I in February 2009. Built by OTEC Company, the ARMD carriers featured OverTechnology with gravity control systems, a reaction heat pile system and even the fold drive (though this super dimension navigation system was never implemented). At 430 meters in length, the ARMD carriers were much smaller than the large http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] and both ARMD-01 and ARMD-02 were originally meant to dock with the larger craft when the ship achieved orbit during its maiden voyage.
As a carrier vessel, the ARMDs held numerous ships and mecha. ARMD-01 held 78 SF-A3 Lancer II space fighters and 270 QF-3000E Ghost fighters (as well as an unknown number of VF-1A variable fighters) just prior to Space War I. In addition to several hundred fighters, the ARMD carrier was armed with many weapons including beam cannons, small anti-aircraft cannons and launchers as well as large anti-ship reaction warheads. The ARMD possessed many large vernier thruster nozzles positioned all over the craft. These powerful thrusters granted the ARMD excellent maneuverability in space and also proved very useful for combat engagement and evasion.Both ARMD-01 and ARMD-02 were destroyed in the first battle of Space War I on February 7, 2009. However, both vessels engaged in combat with the Zentradi fleet and proved quite successful in destroying several large Zentradi capital warships with their anti-ship reaction warheads. Eventually, six more vessels of the ARMD Class were commissioned and both the original ships were replaced. To this day, ARMD-01 and ARMD-02 remain docked with the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] on Earth.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/armd.htm</description>

<description>The VF-2SS Valkyrie II is the main variable fighter of the UN Spacy in AD 2092. Development began in the 2060s and the VF-2SS first rollout was in 2072. The VF-2SS first deployment in combat was against a major Zentradi invasion in 2082. Born out of the VF-2 programs, the VF-2SS is a space-optimized craft using a rail gun as opposed to the older gatling gun pods. Like previous generation variable fighters, the VF-2SS can transform into Fighter, GERWALK and Battroid configurations for use in varied combat conditions. For combat the VF-2SS is armed with only a pair of beam cannons in the dorsal fuselage which becomes the head turret in Battroid mode. However, the VF-2SS Valkyrie II is rarely deployed without the Super Armor Pack (SAP) system equipped.
The VF-2SS accommodates a single pilot held securely in the seat by restraint pads that fit into the shoulders of the flight suit rather than using the old lap belts of the VF-1. The cockpit controls utilize HOTAS and the control panels utilize touch screens in lieu of buttons or switches. The throttle and stick are mounted as part of articulated arms attached to the pilot`s forearms. The cockpit is spacious and even includes a large cargo compartment behind the main seat, large enough to fit an adult. During the events of the Mardook Invasion, SNN reporter http://anidb.net/ch35306 [Kanzaki Hibiki] was able to sit inside this compartment aboard the VF-2SS fighter of http://anidb.net/ch35304 [Silvie Gena].
The VF-2SS was aggressively adopted by the UN Spacy and was found deployed in all space bases and carrier ships of the fleet. Though prolific in the UN Spacy, the VF-2SS was rarely found on Earth where the VF-2JA Icarus was the variable fighter used for planet side aerospace defense. During the Mardook Invasion of the Sol System in 2092, the VF-2SS was the primary combat variable fighter of the UN Spacy forces and distinguished itself as a capable war machine even against the vastly superior numbers of the Mardook forces.

Descended from the http://anidb.net/ch49049 [Nousjadeul-Ger], the Zentradi Powered Suit is a new battle suit armed with a plasma cannon (mounted on the top rear torso) and a large impact cannon (mounted forward in the center chassis). The Powered Suit has very large engines and it has been suggested the suit is designed for high mobility in space. These powered suits were seen extensively during the Mardook Invasion in 2092.

<description>Like the male Zentradi, the female Meltlandi were also enslaved by the Mardook and forced to fight in their wars. However, unlike the vehicles of the enslaved Zentrandi, the Meltlandi Powered Suit is a completely new design. The primary armament of this new battle suit is a beam lance and the large engines suggest the suit is designed for high mobility. Meltlandi Powered Suits were encountered by UN Forces many times during the Mardook Invasion of 2092.

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>The leader of the Mardook forces, http://anidb.net/ch35362 [Feff], pilots a customized battle suit called the Gigamesh. Heavily armored yet highly maneuverable, the Gigamesh excels at close and medium ranged combat. Built into the many armored sections of the suit are a series of anti-armor battle claws and blades that are typically retracted during flight. The most powerful of these close combat weapons is a pair of wing cutters mounted via extendable arms upon the rear torso of the battle suit. These large blades can be activated in an instant and the powerful arm mounts can swing the blades outward to slice any enemy craft. In addition to the many anti-armor blades, the Gigamesh also possesses two missile launchers loaded with 100 mini-missiles for short-to-medium range combat. The pilot is situated inside the heavily armored center torso and controls the suit via a fully integrated cockpit. An armored mask covers the head unit to protect the sensors during combat and can be lifted when required.

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>Designed as a second main variable fighter of the UN Forces, the VF-2JA Icarus is a nimble and well-armed variable fighter. The UN Forces decided that the best use of variable fighter resources was to develop dedicated space variable fighters and atmospheric variable fighters. Though all variable fighters were equipped to operate in all environments, the http://anidb.net/ch49124 [VF-2SS Valkyrie II] was optimized for operation in space while the VF-2JA Icarus was optimized for operation within the atmosphere. The VF-2JA was also more heavily armed in standard configuration and included an optional Missile Pack system that could be used in the atmosphere.
The VF-2JA Icarus differs from the http://anidb.net/ch49124 [VF-2SS] by utilizing only beam weaponry. The main armament is a beam rifle and two beam cannons mounted in the forward nose. The head unit also features two laser cannons that can be utilized in all combat modes. The special Icarus missile packs are a pair of two-tube launchers that add to the VF-2JA the capability to fire missiles. The VF-2JA was a very high performance variable fighter and was able to engage any enemy mecha. During the Mardook Invasion, the VF-2JA fought a variety of Mardook mecha and was more than adequate to defeat the enemy.

<description>The Gigamesh is a heavily equipped main mobile battle suit utilized by the Mardook forces. The Gigamesh excels in close combat and features ten retractable battle claws capable of rending through mecha armor. In addition to the battle claws, the Gigamesh features two large, retractable wing cutters mounted on the rear torso near each shoulder. The deadly wing cutters can be extended on arms to increase their attack range and strike at various angles. While the Gigamesh is a powerful close-combat vehicle, it also features one hundred mini-missiles in two missile launchers mounted one under each arm cowter (elbow armor) for use in ranged attack. The Gigamesh also features mobility equal to a Valkyrie, making this heavily mecha a very potent war machine.

<description>The massive Macross Cannon vessels are heavily armed ships designed for intense anti-ship combat. Over 6,000 meters long, this class of combat vessel is armed with four Zentradi-style cannons that open along the horizontal axis to collimate the heavy converging energy beams for use against enemy warships. The Macross Cannons are extremely effective vessels for countering enemy warships and their multiple heavy guns allow a single Macross Cannon to destroy multiple ships with one volley. While potent against all kinds of enemy warships the Macross Cannons are quite vulnerable to swarms of enemy craft and in sufficient numbers the ships can be successfully assaulted. In the war with the Mardook in 2092, the UN Spacy fielded many Macross Cannons and they initially inflicted heavy losses upon the Mardook forces. However, the Mardook fielded far more ships that eventually overwhelmed the lesser number of Macross Cannons and many of these powerful vessels were lost. Captain http://anidb.net/ch49129 [Nexx] commanded a Macross Cannon in the final battle of the Mardook war.
