<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Even though school clubs in Japan are not mandatory, there is some pressure from the social grid (e.g. fellow students, teachers) to participate in some kind of after-school activity, be it in sports or arts. Colleges also have clubs.
As a comedy element in anime, some students have joined too many clubs, and are thus constantly stressed out. There is also the element of social commentary, making it clear that you have to join a club, if you want to be part of the class. Since self-founded clubs need at least 3 members, the desperate search and advertising for new members can be cause for hilarity in anime.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>season</name>
<description>A season is a division of the year, marked by changes in weather, ecology, and hours of daylight. Seasons result from the yearly orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth`s rotational axis relative to the plane of the orbit. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth`s surface, variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.
During May, June, and July, the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun. The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December, January, and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere.
In temperate and subpolar regions, four calendar-based seasons (with their adjectives) are generally recognized: spring (vernal), summer (estival), autumn (autumnal), fall and winter (hibernal). Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring (prevernal) and late summer (serotinal) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four.

<summary>I just moved from Tokyo to Nagoya. I was looking forward to experiencing Nagoya`s unique dialect and food culture, but so far no one has spoken with an accent, and they don`t actually put miso on everything they eat. I was honestly a bit disappointed... but then, on my way home from school, I heard a girl speaking with such a heavy accent that she sounded like a cat! It seems her name is Yatogame Monaka. I wonder if I`ll ever see her again...

<summary>The student handbook belonging to Yatogame-san that I picked up yesterday has a packet of miso taped to the back... She can`t be a normal girl if she carries that around. On the way to school, I glance inside a café... and see Yatogame-san! This is my chance not only to return her student handbook, but to talk to her again! So I head into the café...

<summary>I was having trouble deciding which club to join at school, but apparently, someone decided that I`d be joining the photography club. Frankly, I wanted something a little more exciting... As I opened the club room door, I saw a girl feverishly taking pictures of Yatogame. I was hoping she`d show me some cute pictures of Yatogame... so how did I get roped into taking pictures of tourist spots instead?

<summary>Today is my photography contest with Yatogame. We were supposed to meet at Nagoya Station, but I couldn`t find her anywhere until we ran into each other near a golden clock. She said the golden clock is the only place where people meet up at Nagoya Station, but how was I supposed to know that?! So now Yatogame is dragging me off to take pictures of famous spots around Nagoya... but just where is she going to take me?

<summary>I just can`t seem to make friends with Yatogame... I keep trying to find things to talk about with her, but she always brushes me aside. Why did Tadakusa-chan volunteer me for the photography club? Isn`t it because I`m an outsider that I can`t get Yatogame to be my friend?! But come to think of it, Tadakusa-chan and Sasatsu-san aren`t from Nagoya, either... So is there some other reason?

<summary>I finally managed to exchange contact info with Yatogame! I thought that meant I`d be able to enjoy her accent from anywhere, but every reply she sends me is in standard Japanese... Sasatsu even said that Yatogame`s messages to her are in the Nagoya dialect, but she won`t use it when messaging me. Her replies are always so blunt, too... I wonder if I did something wrong...

<summary>The other photography club members are throwing me a welcome party. Due to our lack of club funds, each of us can only bring up to 300 yen worth of snacks. I ended up buying Baby Star, Young Donuts, and Kuppy Ramune, but now Yatogame is whispering something to Tadakusa-chan and Sasatsu...

<summary>Since I`m in the photography club, I shoUld have my own camera! I`d love to have an awesome camera like Tadakusa-chan`s, but those things are way more than a high school student can afford... So I asked Yatogame where she got hers, and she said it came from a second-hand store called Komehyo (which I thought was a rice shop at first...). The club members agreed that we`d all visit the Komehyo in Osu together the next day, but it`s long past our meeting time and Tadakusa-chan and Sasatsu are nowhere to be found...

<summary>We joined up with Tadakusa-chan when she was finished fangirling like crazy at her idol concert. Apparently she loves cute things like idols and anime characters. As we were talking about that, Yatogame suddenly blurted out, "It`s 2:00!" and took off somewhere. And we still haven`t run into Sasatsu yet. Where the heck are those two?

<summary>I grabbed a tonkatsu lunch from the cafeteria, but it was too crowded to eat in there, so I headed for the club room. Yatogame was already inside when I got there, about to eat a lunch she brought from home that she apparently made herself... but the only things in it were cucumbers, grilled eggplant, konnyaku, and tofu, all things that came straight out of a package and took no preparation. So I commented that she had nothing to complement her rice, and she pulled out something new...

<summary>Hot... hot... it`s way too hot. Summer in Nagoya is so ridiculously hot! This heavy, muggy heat feels like it`s plastering itself onto my entire body, and even my eyesight`s starting to fade... But the next thing I knew, I was underground, with Yatogame and Tadakusa-chan next to me. Did they carry me down here? Yatogame says I must have a death wish, walking above ground in Nagoya during the summer. Just what the heck is the deal with summers in this city?

<summary>There`s no school today, so I`m hanging out with the photography club gang. We decided to meet up at 8:00 AM, which is pretty early, but they tell me there`s a good reason. So I`ve followed them to... Rent-a-Car? Is this just a karaoke place that called itself Rent-a-Car, or did we walk into a car rental place by mistake?! There are still so many things in Nagoya that are a mystery to me...
