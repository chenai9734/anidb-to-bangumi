<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="229973">The focus in this anime aren`t the invading aliens BETA, but rather the ugliness of humanity even when it is facing extiction. Also the theme isn`t about fights in the front lines but rather development of new weapons, once you get over these facts it`s decent anime in Muv-Luv universe.

However while animation and sounds are good it still didn`t get me really that much psyched up. Maybe i was expecting a little more...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="597887">Since I have read the Manga version of this first, I expected it to have similar characters and other things, not an almost completely different Anime except from the war with the BETA`s and the Mechs. I only watched the first episode a few minutes in, and I didn`t find anything else that related to the Manga. Since I have read the Manga first, the Anime version was a bust for me. I will give this, even though I have not finished this, a 6.8/10.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="506415">During the first episodes I didn`t get so hooked on this series but I still kept watching and started enjoying it as it progressed. . The story presentation was quite nice and character development was great.
Still I would recommend this series mostly for mecha fans.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="94967">This show has a vast and pervasive hater culture which spreads misleading information about it. It`s  very much worth a watch, even if it mainly has only animation and setting going for it. But be warned that the last arc for better or worse comes from the left field, even if they tried to foreshadow it. Worse still the ending is unsatisfactory, not awful or exactly a cliffhanger, just unsatisfactory. And with enough loose ends to probably fill another cour (12-13 episodes) easily. Still, not bad enough for all the hate it has received. If you don`t believe me and others who have recommended it, don`t succumb to hate and see it for yourself.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="103119">Better than you would think from it`s name, and better when compared to most mecha. In my honest opinion it would`ve been better if they stuck to the initial intro`s story/timeline and rather worked up from that to the current. All in all I am enjoying it more than I expected.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="281367">I agree with paulozaffari. The very first proper mecha after Code Geass. First couple of weeks I was hesitant because of the name and the picture on the anidb,however it turned out to be a decent watch till episode 14.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="92754">I`m not a fan. And I was at first put off by the bad ratings. But I am glad that I watched it. Loved the plot twists and mecha fights. Tho the ending kinda hangs there, but it is acceptable to me. Hope there will be a second season, now that would be perfect!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="277062">This anime was intended for fans only; however, this is very similar to other alternative present`s animes, which only shown  a part of the big scenario, centering the plot in specifics situations regarding the main characters. 
In this context, this anime was produced in a good line of plot, developing some personal stories and showing good mechas scenes, not like Kiss dum (wich only centered the story in the main character and his powers).
For th lovers of mecha`s fights and good action, this anime is recommended. Furthermore, regarding the last chapter, I think there will be a 2nd season very soon (I hope).</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="495005">This show has it`s ups and downs however, I have never enjoyed a mecha such as this one. If you enjoy giant robots, zerg rush, and fan service, then this show is for you.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on the Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse light novel, a side story to http://anidb.net/cr820 [âge]`s Muv-Luv Alternative erotic visual novel.
In the year 1973, the invasion of an alien species known as http://anidb.net/ch46632 [BETA] (Beings of Extra Terrestrial origin which is Adversary of human race), began a war that has driven mankind to the brink of extinction. During the next 30 years, they have conquered most of the Eurasian continent, effectively decreasing the world population by billions. In response to their unique behavior and overwhelming strength in numbers, a new type of mobile mechanical humanoid weapon was developed, known as Tactical Surface Fighter (TSF).
Despite the crisis, individual nations still try to further their own interests instead of cooperating. In the year 2001, elite pilots from around the world start to gather at a UN base in Alaska named Yukon to participate in the Prominence Project. This project is a joint effort between Russia and America on research and development of next generation of TSF. The job of the pilots is to test the prototypes, which occasionally involves pitting them one against another...
http://anidb.net/ch41455 [Takamura Yui], a member of the Imperial Royal Guard, is placed in charge of this project and heads to Alaska. Meanwhile, http://anidb.net/ch41453 [Yuuya Bridges], a young soldier in the US Army, makes his way for Alaska as well. Little did either of them know that their encounter would forever change their destinies.</description>

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<tag id="2607" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2009-04-29">
<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>large breasts</name>
<description>Large breasts are breasts a fair notch larger than average, as found in some adolescent girls or fully grown women; however, as anime has no upper limit to breast size, the definition applies somewhat differently. To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.

People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<description>An erotic game (eroge) is a Japanese video or computer game that features erotic content, usually in the form of anime-style artwork. In English, eroge are often called hentai games in keeping with the English slang definition of hentai. This is sometimes shortened to H games. In Japan, eroge are also referred to as 18+ games. Most erotic games are visual novels or dating sims but are not limited to them.
Any anime adaptation of a game that contains (or had a version that contains) adult content (generally sex scenes), regardless of how some fanboys blabber on how "the story in that visual novel was too good to be labelled as porn!", should definitely get this category added under them. This should make it pretty clear as to what is an erotic game and what is not.</description>

<description>The two terms are similar yet different, however, the fact that they look and `feel` the same outweighs the technical differences. For clarification, visual novels are considered a sub-genre of adventure games and the term does not cover simulations. While the two genres often share a common visual presentation, dating sims are sometimes considered to be more statistically based than the "choose your own adventure" style of visual novels; basically, the choices you make might change something else than just the story arc (or your next porn pic). Dating sims can involve several technical elements such as a time limit, several statistics such as looks and charm which can be boosted through exercise, or an "attraction meter" which can increase or decrease depending on one`s decisions.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<description>Alcohol (or more scientifically, ethanol), is one of the world`s oldest psychoactive substances. It is traditionally found in the form of a beverage such as beer, wine, or liquor, although in some contexts it can be inhaled to produce similar or intoxication, and some people prefer another way of consuming beverage-form alcohol.
Alcoholic beverages are many and varied, due to production methods (fermentation or distillation), source materials (grains, fruits, vegetables, other plants), added substances such as flavorings, and many more ways of defining different forms of alcoholic beverages.
Alcoholic beverages are divided into three general classes: beers, wines, and spirits. They are legally consumed in most countries, and over 100 countries have laws regulating their production, sale, and consumption. In particular, such laws specify the minimum age at which a person may legally buy or drink them. This minimum age varies between 16 and 25 years, depending upon the country and the type of drink. Most nations set it at 18 years of age.</description>

<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.

But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.

Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies.

<description>Time in comics is flexible. Each panel shows a single event, which is usually accompanied by a length of dialog, which must take some time to say. This disparity is usually accepted if it isn`t taken to extremes.
But often, characters will exposit when it`s most needed: at the story`s climax, when both the intricacies of the plot and the intensity of action hit their highest.
While the Heroes Outrun the Fireball, Mr. Exposition might explain why the Evil Overlord`s death caused the explosion. The Action Girl can deliver impressive lectures on why the monster`s Achilles` Heel will work, while still engaging in Waif-Fu. The Superhero can quip to his heart`s content and explain his abilities while dueling one insignificant mobster, or deliver a Kirk Summation during the course of a single Finishing Move. Sometimes even apparent mere mortals can give a lecture on what is happening when it would be a much better idea to simply run like hell.

<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<name>daikaijuu</name>
<description>Literally translating to giant monster, daikaiju is an element found often in Japanese entertainment. Although usually for the science fiction genre it is also often used in horror, fantasy, mecha, and to a lesser extent comedy. Any monster that towers over a house technically qualifies as a daikaiju. Some anime, usually mecha, will go as far as calling their daikaiju with a specific title.</description>

<name>ensemble cast</name>
<description>A show with an ensemble cast focuses on a larger group of main characters in a single plot narrative; anime containing several segmented plot narratives (such as episodic or arc-based plots) are excluded. As such, it doesn`t really have a "main" or "lead" character; instead, every member of the central main character group plays an important part in the show`s grander scheme; no single character is more important or prominent than the others (equality of importance). Further, subplots (if any) lead by each character in the ensemble have equal weighting in importance (or lack of weight).

* In a show where no single main character is more important or prominent than the others, 4+ main characters is almost always an ensemble cast.
* A show with 3 main characters of equal importance is likely also an ensemble cast; equality of importance must be considered carefully.
* A show with 2 main characters of equal importance is generally not an ensemble cast situation; however, on an exception basis where neither main character is considered an antagonist, a 2-main-character anime may be considered an ensemble (e.g. http://anidb.net/a11829 [Kimi no Na wa.]).

<description>The theme/genre of survival typically depicts the act or process of continuing to live, generally in a hostile, possibly post-apocalyptic environment. Survival-centered media tends to be dark, set most commonly in a contemporary context, and generally leads either to small groups of people forming closely knit and functional units or to individuals turning against their fellows in a return to the survival of the fittest.</description>

Feelings of any kind towards other characters are best shown by calling each other`s name, loud, REALLY LOUD. For better effect at least twice or thrice. For lover`s couples and mortal enemies it is a requirement to run towards each other while calling each other`s name, unaware of the surroundings.</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<description>Engrish is actually a mispronunciation of English, as can be the result of someone, who does not have English as their primary language of origin (such as Japanese or Chinese). Occasionally characters in the original Japanese dialogue version of an anime will speak in English... however; this often still requires the assistance of subtitles, for while the words are meant to be said in English, the sentence structure and letter pronunciation may still be strongly related to the person’s primary language.</description>

His father abandoned him during his childhood, opting returning to his homeland instead.

Over the course of the series, he develops feelings for Yui though is dense when it comes to the other girls who are in love with him (Cryska, Cui). Very early on, he befriends the youngest of the Scarlet Twins, Inia Sestina, who becomes infatuated with and emotionally attached to him. He later befriends her older "sister" Cryska and as the series progresses, she too falls in love with him. In the past, he was the cause of an accident that killed his commanding officer during a training excersise and was also romantically involved with one of his fellow test pilots, Sharon Heim though why they broke up remains unclear.

<description>Part of the Boening`s Phoenix Initiative, the F-15 ACTV Active Eagle is an upgrade plan for the aging F-15 frame, using avionics, internal parts and external component hardware upgrades to boost its overall performance and even provide (very) limited stealth.
The most radical changes to the Eagle frame is the addition of two thrusters to its back where its weapons would usually be stored; this reduces the Active Eagle`s carrying capacity and operation time, but gives it greater speed and acceleration of up to 8G. The thrusters can be removed to make way for the standard weapons rack system, but this reduces the Active Eagle`s performance. Reworked jump units based off technology from the F-22A Raptor and shoulder-mounted thrusters improve its maneuverability, and its forearms carry sensor pods that extend its detection and striking range.
The Active Eagle`s upgrades are intended to mould it into an offensive role capable of matching 3rd generation TSF standards, where superior range, speed and mobility allows the Active Eagle to quickly and efficiently annihilate any BETA that penetrate the defensive line.</description>

<description>The Type-97 Fubuki is a Tactical Surface Fighter in use by Japanese forces as a training machine. Developed from the Type-94 Shiranui, the Fubuki uses many technologies from third-generation Japanese Tactical Surface Fighters, and has been noted to have performance on par with TSFs used for active combat.</description>

<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>First deployed in 1995, the Strike Eagle is a heavily refurbished F-15 Eagle with increased armament capabilities, improved avionics, composite armour, and other enhancements. This variant has inherited the title of "the strongest second-generation machine" and has kept the title up till today.
Although its appearance is nearly identical to the previous F-15C, the Strike Eagle`s performance is closer to that of an all-new 2.5th generation TSF in no small part thanks to a complete overhaul of its internal components; this enables it new options in combat, one of which is to purge its knee-mounted weapons container once empty to reduce weight. Against combat with other TSFs, it is worth noting that the F-15E is capable of matching up against the Type-94 Shiranui.
Even with the introduction of third-generation TSFs, the reliability, extensive development, and supply of replacement parts maintain the Eagle`s leading position on the TSF market 20 years after its initial introduction. With the introduction of the US` next generation F-22A Raptor delayed, further upgrades for the F-15 are pursued.

<description>The Beings of the Extra Terrestrial origin which is Adversary of human race, more commonly known by the acronym BETA are a fictional extraterrestrial lifeform in the Muv-Luv universe and the primary antagonistic faction against humanity`s forces.
The BETA invaded Earth in 1973 after arriving on the Moon in 1967 and being spotted on Mars in 1958. By 2001, the world population is down to 1 billion people. When they first arrived in Japan in 1998, 36 million people were dead within a week. They vary greatly in size, the smallest identified strains (soldier-class) being around three metres tall, and the largest identified strains (fort-class) at over sixty metres tall. They cannot fly, and so shoot down anything that does, rendering aircraft useless and making evacuation a lot more difficult.
Their very existence is shrouded in mystery. All that mankind knows of them is that they are hostile, are carbon-based lifeforms, and don`t consider humans to be living beings.</description>

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>The 82 Shiki Senjutsu Hokou Sentouki Zuikaku is a first generation TSF used by Imperial Japan Royal Guard dedicated to protection of the Shogun and related individuals.
It is a modification of the Type-77/F-4J Gekishin, which was licensed for Japanese production, and designed with a focus on improving mobility and decreasing weight. Like most Royal Guard TSFs, it has increased performance at the cost of maintainability and ease of production.
In 1978, orders were made to Fugaku, Kawazaki, and Mitsuhishi Heavy Industries for a Royal Guard-use TSF. However, since production of the Gekishin had only just started, they were unable to develop an all-new design at that time. Instead an upgraded machine based on the F-4J was proposed, and the offer was reluctantly accepted by the Royal Guards on the absolute condition that its performance was superior to its base design. Development began in 1979 using data from the European theater of combat.
Changes from the F-4J include a redesign and reduction of the Zuikaku`s armor volume, resulting in a 20% weight decrease. It also includes an increased number of Japanese-made components, including a unique improved laser warning system. The prototype was completed in 1981, and after going through the necessary performance tests and trials, the Zuikaku entered service in 1982.
Although these machines are succeeded by the Type-00 Takemikazuchi, they remain in use by the 1st, 2nd and 24th Royal Guard regiments due to the Takemikazuchi`s maintanence-intensive requirements.
