<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>music</name>
<description>Music anime generally revolves around people concerned with music in their everyday lives. In addition they often adhere to certain genre conventions, the emphasis on training and practice in preparation for competitions, characters desire for self improvement, and pursuit of a specific goal. This is not unlike the Sports category.</description>

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>Sheryl Nome</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Known as the "Galactic Fairy", she is a pop idol from Macross Galaxy fleet who had constantly topped music charts leading people to say that it was impossible not to hear her songs if you lived in this galaxy. As such, her popularity was soaring just as high in the Galaxy`s sister fleet, Macross Frontier. Due to her beauty and singing talent, she is a very proud and self-assured person. Sheryl recognizes the singing talent of Ranka Lee and often offers to help her `behind the scenes` to realise her dream of singing. Sheryl`s first encounter with Alto Saotome was when he served as a backup `performer` at her first concert in Frontier. Eventually, she also develops a crush on him.</description>

<name>Ranka Lee</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Ranka Lee is a petite, lively and cheerful (although naive) teenage girl with green hair.
She suffered from amnesia as a result from witnessing the destruction of the 117th Long Distance Research Fleet in which her biological family perished. She is one-quarter Zentradi, which gives her the ability to have her hair move on its own according to her feelings as well as an above-average resistance to the vacuum of space.
As the adopted younger sister of S.M.S. ace Ozma Lee, she initially attends an all-girl`s high school at the urging of her brother while working part-time at the Chinese restaurant "Nyan-Nyan". She later transfers to the Mihoshi Academy to facilitate her singing career after being discovered at the Miss Macross contest. Later she played a role of http://anidb.net/ch14112 [Mao Nome] in the Bird Human movie.
Ranka started off as a huge fan of Sheryl Nome as she loved singing since her childhood and had dreamt of becoming a singer. She develops a crush on Alto Saotome, especially after being rescued by him when the Vajra first attacked the Macross Frontier fleet.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A high school student in the Mihoshi Academy Pilot Training course. As a result of his fine features and long hair he is often mistaken for a girl at first glance, even receiving the nickname `Hime` (Princess). His appearance was revealed to have been inherited from his late mother, Miyo. Despite this, he is otherwise a rather normal, though somewhat aloof and standoffish, boy. Born into a well-known Kabuki family, his persistent yearning for the skies has made for a thorny relationship with his father. Alto is now undertaking pilot courses at Mihoshi Academy.</description>

<description>Alto`s classmate and friendly rival. He is an excellent marksman, and his motto is to always acquire his targets, be it an enemy or a woman—maintaining his reputation as a considerable ladies` man. He is the originator of Alto`s nickname, "Alto Hime" (Princess Alto). Aside from leading a normal school life, he is also the 2nd Lieutenant of the S.M.S. Skull Squadron and pilots a blue VF-25G (gunner/sniper version). He initially expresses doubt over Alto joining the Skull Squadron, but later accepts him.</description>

<description>Alto and Michael`s junior classmate. He is often frustrated with his seniors, who like to give him a hard time. He is a genius with computers and military electronics. As with Michael, he is a member of the S.M.S. Skull Squadron. He pilots a green RVF-25 (reconnaissance version). His fighter is custodied by three pet Ghost Drones (which he calls Shimon, Johanne and Petero, or Simon, John and Peter) that respond to his verbal commands. His penchant for naming objects with Biblical names extends to his EX-Gear, which he calls "Samson". He is also the heir to the L.A.I. corporation, which means he has access to exotic, prototype technologies and is somewhat involved in Grace and Leon`s plans.</description>

<description>A blue-haired Zentradi female (Meltrandi) who is in command of the all-female S.M.S. Pixie Squadron, with the rank of captain. As a childhood friend of Michael Blanc, she actually harbours a crush on him that does not seem to be reciprocated until too late. She is also a top ace Queadluun-Reapower-armour pilot. Due to a certain genetic anomaly, she appears her age as a fully-developed Meltrandi while macronised, but becomes physically a juvenile in her micronised form. This makes her the perfect target for Michael`s mockery.</description>

<description>Helmsman of the S.M.S. mothership, SMS Macross Quarter. Somewhat stern in appearance, he is "just like a girl inside", as he often says. He was a hair stylist, as well as a make-up artist, somewhere in the past. He is well-liked by female crew members for his good understanding of others. He is an open homosexual and has not-so subtle feelings for Ozma, though he claims to be "Way beyond the point in life where [he] needs [his] love to be reciprocated."</description>

<description>He is the mysterious pilot of the crimson VF-27 variable fighter that Alto Saotome encounters for the first time inside a Vajra carrier. Brera seems to know how to play the first part of Ranka`s song "Aimo" using his harmonica, claiming that the song is the only fragment of his past he still has after memory modification. After saving Ranka from a wild beast attack, the injuries Brera sustained revealed that he is also a cyborg. He harbours a great deal of concern for Ranka`s well-being, but he doesn`t exactly know why.</description>
