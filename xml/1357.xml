<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>space opera</name>
<description>Space opera is a sub-genre of fiction that emphasizes romantic adventures in space. Space opera generally involves large-scale conflicts between opponents with powerful abilities and technology. The genre will often be melodramatic, sometimes playing music that can be nothing short of awesome. Warfare and a battle of wits are usually less emphasized, preferring romance (with exceptions, e.g. Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu). Some space operas tend to be formulaic and sometimes even prosaic, often employing very simple devices and somewhat obvious strategies. An example of this would be the infamous laws of physics in the Macross universe, in which the main male lead will hardly ever get hit in battle.</description>

<description>Born in Yokohama Chinatown, Japan (though she is of partial Chinese descent) as Linn Minmei, Minmay moved in with her uncle http://anidb.net/ch21740 [Shaochin] and aunt http://anidb.net/ch21741 [Feichun] on South Ataria Island in hopes of finding the path to fulfill her dream of becoming a star. On the day of the Zentradi invasion, she meets http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] and a series of events leads to her being swept off on the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] along with the rest of the surviving population from that island. While on the space fortress, Minmay wins the Miss Macross beauty pageant and is propelled into celebrity.When the Macross returns to Earth, she is the only civilian allowed off the space fortress. After her trip home in Japan (where her parents remained), Minmay returned to the fortress with her cousin http://anidb.net/ch10513 [Lynn Kaifun] (and http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru]`s competition for her affection) in tow. Her beauty and singing talent also win over several Zentradi spies sent to explore human society, who spread their impressions among their fleetmates, thus unwittingly evoking peace-oriented attitudes among the alien aggressors. Ultimately, Minmay sings the songs that end the first war against the Zentradi.
During the second part of the series, the very fame and success she craved finally left her tired and virtually alone. She tries to run away from her celebrity status and start anew, with a more simple life alongside http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru], who is now more confused than ever in defining his feelings for Minmay and http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa]; all of this while new conflicts arise between the human and Zentradi survivors of the first war. At the end of the series both http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] and Minmay realize they are very different people, and Minmay accepts that http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] belongs with http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Misa], remaining a friend to the couple afterwards.
In 2012, she embarks on the SDF-2 Megaroad-01 colony ship, which disappears 4 years later during its voyage towards the center of the Milky Way galaxy, becoming a legend in the Macross universe since then.Source: wiki</description>

<description>Hayase Misa is of Japanese ethnicity. She was born into a Japanese family with a hundred-year military lineage and was the only daughter of Admiral http://anidb.net/ch10525 [Hayase Takashi]. Misa also had aspired to enter the military since childhood. This dream was bolstered by a desire to join her boyfriend and first love, http://anidb.net/ch10524 [Riber Fruhling], in the UN Spacy. Misa`s hope is tragically unrealized as http://anidb.net/ch10524 [Riber] dies during the destruction of the return fleet from the Salla Mars Base where he was stationed, shortly after leaving Misa on Earth.
After graduating first in her class at the UN Spacy Officers` Academy, she earned a bridge post aboard the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross]. She and fellow SDF-1 bridge officer http://anidb.net/ch10509 [Claudia LaSalle] became close friends. As Misa herself admits, her mind is constantly preoccupied with duty. This changes, however, after she meets the young pilot http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru]. Their officer/subordinate status would slowly evolve through the series, from originally a difficult professional relationship (with http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] even calling her "old lady" when he first hears her over his Valkyrie`s onboard radio, which results in his senpai, http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker], getting a good laugh, much to Misa`s chagrin) to a friendly personal one; and much later to a romantic one, clashing with the already strong infatuation http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] has with http://anidb.net/ch7418 [Lynn Minmay]. She also has some short-lived feelings for http://anidb.net/ch7418 [Minmay]`s cousin http://anidb.net/ch10513 [Kaifun], who bears a striking physical resemblance to the deceased http://anidb.net/ch10524 [Riber].
Initially ranked as First Lieutenant, she is later promoted to Captain, and later to Major, concluding with her being chosen as the commander of the new SDF-2 Megaroad-01 ship and crew.
Despite having early disputes with http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru], she slowly begins to harbor feelings for him as they share some adventures during the war, discovering both have very much in common. In the final episode, http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] realizes he is in love with Misa, and after the climactic final battle, they marry and become members of the SDF-2 Megaroad-01 crew to leave on a stellar exploration mission in 2012. Shortly thereafter, Misa and http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] have a daughter, Ichijou Miku, in 2013.
After their ship disappears in 2016 without a trace near the center of the galaxy, they were reported as missing. The whereabouts of Misa and http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] and the ship`s crew (includinghttp://anidb.net/ch7418 [ Lynn Minmay], who remained as their friend and also joined the exploration mission) are still unknown.Source: wiki</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Max Jenius was born in Europe. He is a young fighter pilot, having joined http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru]`s Vermillion Team, along with http://anidb.net/ch10508 [Kakizaki Hayao], at the age of only 16. Jenius shows in his first sortie that he is a preternaturally talented ace pilot who is near invincible in combat, despite his need to wear corrective lenses on duty. Max is quickly recognized as the top pilot of the force, as marked by being granted to distinctively repaint his mecha into his preferred blue color.
Jenius` skill at piloting mecha becomes even more celebrated with feats that no other pilot would have thought of, much less achieved. One outstanding incident involves his infiltrating a Zentradi battleship in his valkyrie and disguising it with a Zentradi uniform, allowing him to escape detection.
Jenius is not above an occasional egotistical musing when he is off duty, but he also respects his comrades and they return the favor. He is also an incurable romantic in his youth which shows when he meets his future wife. That occurred when the top Zentradi ace pilot, http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia Fallyna], hears about a formidable pilot aboard the humans` http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] space fortress and seeks to challenge him personally in battle. Max manages to defeat http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] not once, but thrice. The first in their respective mechas, the second in simulated combat (a video game) and finally in a knife fight to the death. It is this final fight where the two rivals fall in love. Immediately after the knife-fight in the park Max proposes to http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] who accepts. Afterward, http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] is allowed to join the mainline fighting forces of the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] and becomes Max`s wingmate on duty, piloting a distinctive red Valkyrie alongside Max`s blue one.
After the Zentradi Fleet that nearly destroys the Earth is vanquished, Max and http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] settle down in the new city built around the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] and begin a new life together. In March 2011, they give birth to a daughter (the first of seven) named Komilia Maria Fallyna Jenius. The name Komilia (which means "Little Milia") is chosen because with her green hair and green eyes, she looks so much like her mother (although it has also been suggested that the "ko" simply refers to the Japanese kanji character "child" that is often used on the end of Japanese female personal names - a suggestion which is supported by the title of episode 30: Viva Maria, as opposed to Viva Komilia). Komilia proves how related the Humans and Zentradi are. The "first stellar interracial child" is very unabashed baby, and proves resilient to http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia]`s sometimes rough and inexperienced handling. Max, despite his relatively young age, proves to be a happy and successful father, although he clearly has a strong dislike of Komilia`s playfulness with his hair. http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa] and http://anidb.net/ch10509 [Claudia La Salle] find Komilia adorable and are amazed that she isn`t shy at all, and envy Max and http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] for having such a beautiful child.
Max and his family play a crucial role in the U.N.` capture of a factory satellite in November 2011. After blasting their way into the enemy command ship, Max and http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] proudly display their child, cradled in http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia]`s arms and wearing a tiny pink and white spacesuit, to the hostile Zentradi. Max smiles as http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] explains that Komilia "was created by the two of us...". The hostile Zentradi, who have had no exposure to human culture and have never seen a baby before, become terrified of Komilia and flee in fear, causing chaos aboard the command ship and disorder throughout the enemy fleet. This allows the earth forces and the allied Zentradi to seize the factory.
In the original Macross series, Max and http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] have seven natural daughters and adopt a Zentradi girl over a period of twenty years from 2011 to 2031. The oldest is Komilia Maria Fallyna Jenius, who is the only one seen in the original series. The youngest is http://anidb.net/ch14046 [Mylene Flare Jenius], who becomes a major character in http://anidb.net/a442 [Macross 7]. http://anidb.net/ch41428 [Emilia Jenius] is seen briefly in http://anidb.net/a443 [Macross 7 the Movie: The Galaxy`s Calling Me!].----------
In http://anidb.net/a996 [The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?], an animated film adaptation of the original series, Max and http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia] met in a completely different way. After the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] returns to Earth, the Meltrandi, under the command of Lap Lamiz, launched their own campaign against the Macross. The Meltrandi fleet sends in their highly trained http://anidb.net/ch49048 [Queadluun-Rau] power armor fighters, led by their ace pilot, http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia Fallyna], to retrieve a Protoculture tablet containing an ancient song they believed could help them defeat their Zentradi enemies. In the ensuing battle with the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] and subsequent death of http://anidb.net/ch10508 [Kakizaki Hayao], Max and http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia] fight against each other. In the last phase of the battle, Max and http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia] enter the Lap Lamiz`s ship and there, Max manages to down his opponent. Upon breaching the armor, Max is enamored by http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia] as she is with him, and expresses his awe at the Meltran pilot.
In the final battle between http://anidb.net/ch49057 [Boddole Zer] and the Macross fleet, a macronized Max is seen with http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia] battling together in their respective specialized blue and red http://anidb.net/ch49048 [Queadluun-Raus]. This scene is one of the few scenes showing Max without his glasses.
Another difference in the movie is that after http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker]`s death, Max is promoted to leader of the Skull Squadron, thus having Hikaru Ichijyo and http://anidb.net/ch10508 [Kakizaki Hayao] briefly as his subordinates.Source: wiki</description>

<description>Milia Fallyna is an ace http://anidb.net/ch48911 [Quimeliquola Queadluun-Rau] power armor pilot, a female of the giant race of warriors known as the Zentradi. Serving on board an all-female ship in the http://anidb.net/ch10537 [Lap Lamiz] fleet, she joined Commander http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai Kridanik]`s investigation of the "miclones" of Earth, and their spacecraft, the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross]. After being beaten in a pitched battle against the human pilot http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Maximilian Jenius,] she volunteered for micloning and, reduced to human size, infiltrated the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross]. Rather than espionage, her real aim was to find and kill the man who had humiliated her. At a video game arcade, she again finds herself unbeatable until she is challenged to a duel by http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max], an incredibly skilled pilot and the pilot whom Milia had dueled against in real combat. Milia concludes (correctly) that http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] must be the ace pilot which she faced in real combat. http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] asks Milia out on a date, and Milia accepts although she secretly plots to kill him. Later, when http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] meets with her in a park, Milia reveals that she is a Zentradi and tries to kill him with a knife. After a short fight, http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] disarms her. Beaten for a third time, she falls to her knees, begins to cry and asks http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] to kill her. Yet, despite everything that has occurred, http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] puts his finger under her chin and the two look into each other`s eyes for a long moment. It is then that Milia has a revelation: that the emotion http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] had awoken in her was not hate, but love. The two seem to float towards each other and then passionately kiss. They are then quickly married and Milia puts her life as a Zentradi warrior behind her, choosing instead to live with http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max].
After defecting to the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] and marrying http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max], Milia was allowed to become a member of the UN Spacy in her own right and piloted a red-painted http://anidb.net/ch48789 [VF-1J Valkyrie] Fighter into battle thereafter as her husband`s wingmate. However, caring for her own people, she convinced http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] and the other pilots to capture, rather than kill, their Zentradi opponents. This deed actually saved the ship during an all out attack by her race to destroy the ship as it, among other events, led to mutiny in the Zentradi forces severe enough for Commander http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] to call a cease fire.Source: wiki</description>

She meets the child Basara as he gives her some food (which he had gotten by initially trying to trade his guitar to a baker, who just gave him the bread because he liked Basara`s music).

<description>For thousands of millennia, an ancient war raged across the Milky Way Galaxy unbeknownst to the human race. In July 1999, that war came to humanity`s doorstep when a super-light-velocity spaceship crash-landed on Earth. The United Nations commences an investigation of the crash site located on South Ataria Island in the North Pacific Ocean. The spacecraft is given the code name Alien StarShip-1 (ASS-1) and investigations in the months following the crash uncover startling discoveries. Giant aliens, some five times the size of a human, crewed the craft which is revealed to be a warship; a Gun Destroyer from a faction called the Supervision Army. Most important of any discovery found in the alien spacecraft is the advanced technology contained within it. Given the name "OverTechnology," the United Nations Government (U.N.G) coordinates research quickly to understand it.
In 2001, several countries including Japan, United States, Russia, Germany, Britain, and France collaborate to establish an alien technology research institute called OTEC. Less than a year later, the OTEC commences a project to restore and reconstruct the ASS-1 to be commissioned as a capital ship for the newly formed United Nations Government. From February 2001 forward, the spacecraft is designated as the SDF-1; Super-Dimension-Fortress-1. Incredible advances are made from the research including the thermonuclear reaction system used to power the craft, the gravity control system, the space fold system for traveling faster-than-light and the super-dimension-energy cannons, the main weapon of the SDF-1. These technologies are adapted quickly and soon OverTechnology is being utilized in dozens of industries, notably super-small-scale thermonuclear reactors and the development of thermonuclear reaction bombs. Despite these unprecedented leaps of progress, many problems arise and threaten to undermine the launch of the SDF-1.
Originally set to launch in 2006, civil unrest abroad and the outbreak of the Anti-Unification Wars slows the SDF-1 restoration project. Eventually, the "UN Wars" cease on January 20th 2007 and the SDF-1 is rescheduled for launch in February 2009. It is the day of the launching ceremony that the opposing faction of the ancient war tracks the residual energies left by the ASS-1`s space fold and follow it to the Sol system. The newly christened SDF-1 Macross, armed with a heretofore undiscovered automated defense system, activates in response to the approaching enemy forces known as the Zentradi. The main cannon of the SDF-1 Macross fires from the surface of the Earth and destroys two Zentradi ships some 280,000 km out in space. The remaining Zentradi retaliate and intense fighting ensues. In an attempt to maneuver and regain the initiative, Captain http://anidb.net/ch10507 [Bruno J. Global] activates the space fold system to transport the SDF-1 Macross into Lunar orbit. Due to limited human understanding of the space fold system and improper instrumentation, the SDF-1 Macross folds far beyond the Moon, transporting the ship and much of the surrounding surface of South Ataria Island out past Pluto. This single engagement initiates the beginning of Space War I between the UN Spacy and the Zentradi.Over the length of more than a year during which Space War I is fought, the SDF-1 Macross travels from the outskirts of the Sol system back to Earth, fighting the forces of the Zentradi. The Zentradi are determined to capture the vessel, obsessed with the secrets of the ship`s obvious reconstruction and reaction weapons. This advantage allows the Macross to effectively use it`s formidable defenses, thwarting many attempts to be captured by the enemy. After Space War I ends on March 10th 2010, the Macross landing site is chosen as home for the reconstruction of Macross City. The Macross takes part in one more major engagement against rogue Zentradi Kamjin Kravshera`s forces during the Defensive Battle of Macross City in January 2012. Despite extensive damage following the battle, the Macross is repaired and undergoes a major refit. To this day, the Macross remains the home of the U.N. Military Command Center and is berthed in Macross City on Earth.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Maximilian Jenius is a fighter pilot from Europe, married to http://anidb.net/ch41157 [Milia Fallyna Jenius].
Prior to the events of Macross 7, Max is appointed commander of the 7th Macross Fleet and captain of the flagship Battle 7, with a de-micronized Exsedol Folmo as his advisor. Although separated from Milia, he is in almost-daily contact with her, due to her position as mayor of the civilian ship City 7, and possibly continues to harbor feelings for her. Despite being in his fifties, Max appears to have aged very little from his original appearance. Character designer Haruhiko Mikimoto half-jokingly said that is the case "Because he`s a genius. Growing old is a state of mind for average men...".
Max and Milia, in addition to being legally separated from each other, are also separated from most of their children - all but their youngest daughter, Mylene Flare Jenius, have moved away from the Macross 7 fleet. Max often checks up on Mylene, whom he feels very protective of. As the series progresses, Max becomes responsible for the establishment of "Sound Force", a trio of Valkyries piloted by the members of Fire Bomber which includes Mylene. Initially, he forbids Mylene from joining Sound Force, for fear of putting her life in danger, but is persuaded to allow her to join after witnessing her skill as a pilot and musician. Max often clashes with Milia about Mylene, but the two are able to remain civil (usually) around each other for the sake of their daughter, who unsuccessfully tries to bring them together again.
Late in the series, Max and Milia are able to overcome their troubled past and resume flying together in their distinctive blue and red VF-22 Sturmvogels in order to save the fleet from threat posed by the Protodeviln. In the final battle, Max, Milia and Mylene fight side-by-side against Lord Geperunitch.</description>

<description>Milia Fallyna Jenius is an ace Quimeliquola Queadluun-Rau power armour pilot, a female of the giant race of warriors known as the Zentradi.
In Macross 7 Milia sports a new short hairdo rather than her original long hair in Macross. Like Max, she doesn`t seem to have aged. However, she is sensitive whenever people, especially Basara Nekki refer to her age.
Milia is elected overwhelmingly as the mayor of City 7, the largest and main ship of the Macross 7 colonization fleet. She is accompanied by Mylene, her daughter, who lives separately. Max is also present as commander of the Macross 7 fleet, although the couple are now separated. It is also implied that she still may have feelings for her estranged husband.
As City 7`s Mayor, Milia is determined not only to maintain law and order among her citizens, but to marry off the rebellious Mylene as well. In the series, Milia still possesses her red VF-1J Valkyrie, and like Max, she can still fly a Valkyrie exceptionally and as passionately as she did in the original Super Dimension Fortress Macross. Milia clearly shows signs of affection towards her antique red VF-1J when it was destroyed by Sivil while being piloted by Gamlin Kizaki.
Later in the series, Milia, while serving as City 7`s mayor, would from time-to-time pilot her Valkyrie - first piloting her VF-1J and gradually moving on to more advanced Valkyries, the VF-17D Nightmare and VF-22S Sturmvogel II respectively, all of which are coloured deep red - to assist the battle of the Macross 7 fleet against the Protodeviln and their Varauta Army. In the final episode of Macross 7, Milia and Max fought side-by-side in their own custom coloured VF-22 Sturmvogel variable fighters against Lord Geperunitch.

<description>In the early 2020`s, the U.N. Government found itself requiring a new type of variable fighter with a combat profile much different from that of the current VF-5000 fighter. In 2022, development began on the VF-11 Thunderbolt, a design descended directly from the original VF-1 Valkyrie (though the two Battroid mode silhouettes are similar, the structures vary greatly). After the VF-1, few variable fighter airframes were multi-environment and were limited operating either in the air or in space. The VF-11 Thunderbolt broke from the norm and was a legitimate multipurpose successor to the VF-1. The program proceded on schedule and the VF-11`s first flight was made in 2028. Early in the development process, then Captain Milia Jenius of the Eagle Nest Aerial Tactics Center became one of many vocal advocates for the inclusion of the forward canard wing on the VF-11, a design choice which caused heated debate. While the canard wing enhanced the VF-11`s maneuverability considerably in an atmosphere, the increased air resistance also limited the fighter`s maximum speed. Fortunately, Captain Jenius piloted the No. 2 VFX-11 prototype (fitted with a canard, unlike the No. 1 prototype) in an operation to rescue a U.N. chief advisor. The flight data collected during this operation convinced the U.N.G. to adopt the VF-11 with the canard wing implemented. In December 2030 mass production of the VF-11 began and the Thunderbolt officially replaced the http://anidb.net/ch49112 [VF-4 Lightning III] as the main variable fighter of the U.N. Spacy.
The VF-11 was deployed on long-distance immigration ships, colonized planets and deep outer space forces where it served well as a variable fighter with emphasis on speed, maneuverability and economy of design. The Thunderbolt excelled in all respects such as firepower, maneuverability and maintainability while showing high comprehensive performance for a general purpose machine both inside and outside of atmosphere. The http://anidb.net/ch49112 [VF-4 Lightning III] and the VF-5 emphasized deployment in outer space and the VF-5000 Star Mirage focused on atmospheric performance. By contrast, one of the factors which granted the VF-11 high-deployment status was the Thunderbolt`s multipurpose design and high level of comprehensive performance in any operational environment (similar to the superior flexibility of the VF-1 Valkyrie). Utilizing a 30 mm gun pod as it`s primary weapon, the VF-11`s had as much destructive power against modern enemy mecha in a much smaller caliber than the VF-1`s 55 mm cannon. The smaller shell size also granted the VF-11 a much greater ammunition payload and the gun pod design included extra magazines for reloading in battle. An emphasis on close-range combat capability in Battroid mode was also featured by way of an anti-mecha bayonet. In addition to the anti-aircraft pulse laser, the VF-11 included the first hard defense feature in the form of an anti-projectile shield for GERWALK and battroid modes that dramatically improved resilience. The success of the anti-projectile shield prompted implementation in future variable fighters. The success of the VF-11 also saw the development of a modern Super Part system (which gave the Thunderbolt missiles in space) and the APS-11 Protect Armor system for special operations.
The VF-11 Thunderbolt served with distinction for over a decade and operated as the main variable fighter of the U.N. Spacy all throughout the 2030`s. Eventually, the VF-11`s lack of missile weaponry and aging design prompted new priorities for the U.N.G. military. In 2040 the VF-11 was scheduled to be replaced pending the winning design of the Super Nova AVF project, a competition between the http://anidb.net/ch48621 [YF-19] and http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21] variable fighters in development since the mid-2030`s. In 2041 the formal decision was made to adopt VF-19 as the next generation of main variable fighters but while the VF-11 would be slowly replaced, the Thunderbolt continued operational deployment in many fleets well into the 2040s.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrossplus/vf-11b.htm</description>

<description>The Quiltra-Queleual Class Landing Ship Tank (LST), like nearly all Zentradi ships of the line, has been in active service for hundreds of millennia. Another product of the war machines used during the ancient Schism War of the old Galactic Empire, the Quiltra-Queleual serves the role of a planetary assault ship. More than any of the other Zentradi capital ships, this vessel devotes the vast majority of internal volume to mecha bays and hangars for battle pods, fighters and re-entry craft. The ship features several launching hatches for efficient deployment including a large re-entry pod hatch. While not specifically designed for ship-to-ship combat, the Quiltra-Queleual still features a moderate number of anti-ship and anti-fighter weapons for attack and defense.

Built in the latter era of the Protoculture and used extensively during the Schism War, the Thuverl-Salan`s impressive design and functionality guaranteed a long service life. The ship features numerous beam and missile weapon emplacements all along the craft and the practical wedge-shaped hull enables the Thuverl-Salan to bring to bear the maximum number of guns possible against a target vessel at nearly any angle. In addition to firepower, the Thuverl-Salan also carries numerous Glaug mecha, Gnerl Fighter Pods and Re-Entry ships for transporting land-based mecha to the surface of a planet.

<description>The final of the four minor VF-1 variants, the VF-1S carries the heaviest weapon load of the standard variable fighter. Manufactured only in limited numbers, Northrom also enlisted Kyuusei Industry to design a new head unit for their own variant. The VF-1S mounts four of the Mauler series RÖV-20 anti-aircraft laser cannons and enjoys several upgrades in addition to firepower. The engines are improved Shinnakasu Heavy Industry/P&amp;W/Roice FF-2001D models resulting in measurably improved thrust and an enhanced avionics package is featured in each VF-1S. While usually reserved for CAGs (Commander of Air Group), the VF-1S also sometimes finds itself serving as the variable fighter for a squadron leader much like the VF-1J. Captain http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker] piloted a VF-1S during his command of the infamous Skull Squadron.

<name>Queadluun-Rau</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>The largest and arguably most devastating Zentradi mecha of Space War I, the Queadluun-Rau battle suits of the female division forces are fast, maneuverable and well-armed mecha. Like the Nousjadeul-Ger of the Zentradi male division forces, the Queadluun-Rau is a powered suit of armor featuring two reaction furnaces that power massive dual engines, propelling the suit at tremendous speeds. A special inertia vector control system gives the Queadluun-Rau unparalled maneuverability and allows efficient atmospheric flight using only vernier thrusters, effectively compensating for the suit`s lack of aerodynamic lift. In battle, the female powered suit relies upon a deadly array of rapid-fire laser and particle cannons, but most lethal of all are the missile launchers. Armed with over a hundred individual short-range missiles, the Queadluun-Rau is capable of engaging dozens of targets, inflicting heavy damage with torrents of guided missile fire.
Most famous of all Queadluun-Rau units in Space War I was the personal mecha of Zentradi ace pilot http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia Fallyna]. Her incredible skills were legendary; http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] was undefeated in her military career up until Space War I. Such was her prowess that her reputation was known even among the Zentradi male divisions, a point of contention for http://anidb.net/ch10516 [Quamzin Kravshera]. Infuriated by http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Millia]`s harsh criticisms of his failures in battle against the forces of the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross], http://anidb.net/ch10516 [Quamzin] cunningly goaded http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] into battle against http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Maximilian Jenius], the ace Valkyrie pilot of the UN Spacy. In her Queadluun-Rau, http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] sought the enemy ace eagerly, but was soundly defeated in battle by http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Jenius] in his http://anidb.net/ch48787 [VF-1A Valkyrie] and barely escaped with her life. It is also notable that another Queadluun-Rau unit was responsible for the attack upon Major http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker]`s http://anidb.net/ch48790 [VF-1S Valkyrie] fighter, the incident which ultimately proved fatal for the veteran ace pilot. Capable of deployment in any environment, the Queadluun-Rau could engage enemy forces in space, in the atmosphere or on the ground. Despite a lack of emphasis upon long-range weaponry, the Queadluun-Rau exceled at medium-to-close range combat and was one of the most versatile and successful Zentradi mecha.
Following the Great Interstellar War (Space War I), the Queadluun-Rau units were employed by the U.N. Forces. Unfortunately, breakdowns in production at the Factory Satellite caused a gradual decrease in operational units. Operational rates were reduced such that by the 2030s the Queadluun-Rau could not be supported by available spare parts. Fortunately, support for reproduction of the Queadluun-Rau remained strong. In 2035, variable fighter design and manufacturing company General Galaxy was entrusted by the U.N. Forces with a modernization and reproduction plan for the Queadluun-Rau.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/queadluun-rau.htm</description>

<description>Already largely organic in appearance, the film version of the Queadluun-Rau underwent only a subtle redsign from the television series. The most notable difference was the change in colors, utlizing the Meltrandi magenta fleet colors for the standard version while http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia]`s unit was colored red (perhaps a subtle historical allegory to Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron of World War I). Aside from the different colors and slight stylistic changes, the Queadluun-Rau was just as deadly in the movie.

The Nupetiet-Vergnitzs main gun activates by lifting the dorsal hull and dropping the ventral hull (nearly opening the entire ship from stem to stern) and thus acts as a collimator for super dimension energy to collect and fire forward. In Space War I, Commander http://anidb.net/ch49046 [Vrlitwhai] used this powerful weapon to blast a large hole through the hull of the Bodol Zer Mobile Fortress, allowing the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] to fly into the ship and attack Gorg Bodolzaa directly.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrossdyrl/nupetiet-vergnitzs-dyrl.htm</description>

Decorated in the familiar green hull of the Zentradi forces, the sprawling Gol Boddole Zer mobile fortress appears almost organic in design, resembling vegetation. At some 600 kilometers in width, the vessel was bristling with weapons and functioned as a mobile port for the Zentradi ships of the line. Most impressive of all, the Gol Boddole Zer mobile fortress featured a powerful main beam gun located in large globe at the bow of the ship. When fired, the beam gun produced a broad beam of energy that could destroy thousands of smaller warships or even a vessel as large as itself with but a single shot. Though the gun could only be fired once (due to damage over the many years of interstellar warfare), Zentradi leader Gol Boddole Zer utilized it to destroy the Meltrandi mobile fortress in the final battle of Space War I. However, http://anidb.net/ch49057 [Boddole Zer]`s victory was achieved only at the cost of destroying thousands of his ships in the line of fire, a decision that ultimately brought about his own demise.

<description>The medium-sized, gunboat-class is a famous Meltlandi vessel that was commanded by the ever more famous http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia 639] during Space War I. The two large-sized engines provide the gunboat with such high maneuverability and acceleration the ship can achieve the same capabilities as a space fighter. An excellent battleship, the gunboat boasts a potent high-output, short-range guided converging beam gun built as the bow of the ship. When preparing to fire, the bow of the gunboat separates laterally, gathers energy between the two forward booms and releases a very destructive blast at an enemy target. The gunboat class is suitable for a myriad of operation roles including search, reconnaissance, raids upon enemy bases or special missions. Like it`s counterpart vessel the http://anidb.net/ch48996 [Quiltra-Quelamitz] in the male Zentradi fleets, the gunboat is also well equipped for atmospheric maneuvering. Since it is operated by female Meltlandi, the ship carries a complement of http://anidb.net/ch49048 [Queadluun-Rau] mecha. The Meltlandi sent a gunboat to Earth to intercept and destroy the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] upon its return. With a devastating blast from the powerful main gun, the Meltlan gunboat destroyed the top hull booms on the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1]`s own main gun, causing the massive vessel to crash.

<description>The Uraga Class Escort Battle Carrier is the next generation stealth carrier built to replace the Guantánamo Class Stealth Carriers. The Uraga Class, built with weaponry, armor and maneuverability comparable to a cruiser, is often used as the flagship of small fleets. At 550 meters long, the Uraga Class ships are much larger conventional spacecraft but still significantly smaller than the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] or the later New Macross Class ships. The Uraga is built with a stealth composition and features a dual deck launching system for variable fighters; one deck running the latter dorsal two-thirds of the ship and an internal deck underneath with a launching deck in the forward third. This efficient deck design allows rapid deployment of multiple craft simultaneously and has become common on many UN Spacy carrier vessels.
These ships are rare among colonization fleets due to their high costs compared to the http://anidb.net/ch48791 [ARMD] carriers but the UNG remains committed to replacing the older http://anidb.net/ch48791 [ARMD] carriers one by one with Uraga Class vessels. As more Uraga Class Escort Battle Carriers are built, they are poised to become the mainstay combat and carrier ship for the UN Spacy. Many Uraga Class vessels are part of Earth`s defense fleet in 2040 and are found serving as command ships for large groups of Guantánamo Class Stealth Carriers and Stealth Frigates. Several Uraga Class Escort Battle Carriers are also in active service with the 37th Long-Distance Colonization Fleet, serving as defensive stations docked to unarmed core ships such as the Riviera and Hollywood.

<description>In the years following Space War I, the United Nations Government (UNG) quickly rebuilt much of the lost infrastructure and soon the UN Spacy was rebuilding the fleet. Impressed with the initial combat performance and multi-functionality of the http://anidb.net/ch48791 [ARMD] Class Space Carriers, the UN Spacy pursued design and construction of a next generation http://anidb.net/ch48791 [ARMD] Class vessel. The result is the Guantánamo Class Stealth Carrier, an improved space carrier with stealth capabilities and its own Space Fold System for interstellar travel. As a carrier, the Guantánamo Class has a large launch bay in the forward section, a dock in the aft section of the ship (to link with large vessels) and large external fuel tanks with stealth covers. Though this class of vessel utilized many new technologies, the economy of design proved relatively inexpensive and the UN Spacy deployed massive numbers of Guantánamo Stealth Carriers. These ships are found primarily as the main-force carrier in the colonization fleets, but the Guantánamo Class Stealth Carrier is also used extensively for planetary defense. In 2040, Earth has a vast defense fleet stationed in orbit consisting of numerous vessels that included the Guantánamo Class ships as well as thousands of armed defense satellites spread amongst the fleet.

<description>The smallest of the UN Spacy ships of the line, the Northampton Class Stealth Frigate is an easily constructed vessel and functions as the main-force warship for colonization fleets. The main engines are built around the center circumference of the rear hull and supply the 250-meter long frigate with excellent speed and maneuverability that compensates for a lack of heavy firepower. Like many of the next generation space vessels of the UNG, the stealth frigate features a stealth composition and functions as a carrier ship for variable fighters. In battle the stealth frigate utilizes several concealed launch bays for the fighters and has several anti-ship missile launchers and converging energy beam cannons. The widespread use of this class has lead to the deployment of numerous modified Bolognese frigates such as firepower-enhanced, reconnaissance and early-warning variants. The stealth frigates have also been adopted by Zentradi crews and these ships feature more Zentradi technology with distinctive hull designs. The stealth frigate fulfill a primary operational role and thus there are large numbers of these ships serving in the UN Spacy fleets, from planetary defense around Earth to far reaching colony fleets like the 37th long-distance colonization fleet. Stealth Frigates serve as the first defensive line in the emigration fleets, with aircraft carriers forming the second defense line. Additionally, a squadron of stealth frigates will operate as "pilot fish" for surveying routes and securing supplies ahead of a emigration fleet.

While the VF-11 took first flight after only six years of design, the complicated and exacting research of the VF-17 didn`t produce a viable craft until the variable fighter`s first flight 2035. With the success of the flight tests, the U.N. Spacy adopted the VF-17 as a second line variable mecha and included squadrons on many of the colonization fleets, notably the 37th long-distance colonization fleet lead by the 7th Battle Class Stealth Space Attack Carrier in 2038.
The VF-17 Nightmare is a radically different variable fighter than previous generations, featuring completely new wing and transformation systems. Primarily designed as a special operations variable fighter and heavy battroid, the VF-17 is both larger and heavier than most other valkyries and features minimal atmospheric control surfaces subsequent to its primary role as a space fighter. To offset the nearly 12 ton weight, the VF-17 operates two extremely powerful Shinnakasu Heavy Industry/P&amp;W/Roice FF-2100X thermonuclear turbine engines with over twice as much thrust as the VF-11B. These incredibly powerful engines produce enough thrust for the VF-17 to achieve orbit unaided (the first production model variable fighter to do so) while also making the craft an ideal space superiority fighter. In addition to these powerful flight characteristics, the Nightmare is also designed as a stealth mecha and utilizes internally stored weaponry. As was typical following the success of a variable fighter, the VF-17 was eventually fitted with several equipment packages from Radomes and Fold Boosters to customized weaponry and Super Pack systems (though the VF-17 generally avoides the use of Super Parts and external weapons to maintain passive stealth capabilities).
The VF-17 was built in several different versions, but the VF-17D in service during the early 2040`s is the most distinguished model. Notable U.N. Spacy pilot http://anidb.net/ch41155 [Gamlin Kizaki] piloted a VF-17D Nightmare during his service in Macross 7`s elite unit Diamond Force until his promotion to Full Lieutenant when he was assigned a VF-17S. It was originally the intention of the UN Spacy that the VF-17 Nightmare be replaced as the primary special operations fighter of the UN Spacy by the VF-22S Sturmvogel II, also a General Galaxy design. However, by 2050`s the UN Spacy itself would undergo organizational changes as the New UN Spacy (NUNS) and priorities would also change. General Galaxy redesigned the VF-17 Nightmare into the VF-171 Nightmare Plus, a new main fighter/bomber for the New UN Spacy forces (circa 2059).

<description>The colonization of space that began in 2012, though initially beset by misfortune, was proving largely successful for the human race. Mass cloning provided significant population growth and the Megaroad Class ships were regularly carrying colonists to inhabit planets in the far reaches of space. Eventually, the growth of both the population and resources of the United Nations Government (UNG) demanded larger, more sophisticated ships to continue the colonization of space. The New Macross Class Super-Massive Colonization Battleships were designed and constructed. In 2030, the next major colonization fleet departed for the unknown with the first New Macross Class ship in command. With a total fleet population of over one million people, these massive colony fleets would quickly become the standard for the new wave of space colonization in the 2030`s.
The Battle Class Stealth Space Attack Carrier vessels are designed primarily as flagships for super-long-distance colonization fleets. Though armed for heavy anti-ship combat the primary role of the Battle Class is acting as mobile command center and the largest spacecraft/aircraft carrier in the fleet. The powerful main gun is a super beam weapon built as a mobile gunship separable from the ventral hull of the ship. The gunship is built with its own reactor and is capable of independent navigation if required. Like the SDF-1 Macross Class Super Dimension Fortress ships that preceded them, the Battle Class vessels are fully transformable ships that can convert into a humanoid-shaped Attack mode. The main gun is supplemented with four beam cannons but no additional turret weapons or missile launchers are found in most ships of this class. The Battle Class instead carries a large number of over 700 variable fighters, attack craft and bombers that can engage enemy fleets and any enemy attack craft. For rapid deployment of all aerospace craft, the Battle Class has twelve total standard catapults; six on the forward deck, three on the center deck and three on the aft port side angled deck. The ship is also equipped with three additional electromagnetic catapults and a command liaison hatch mounted just forward of the main bridge for immediately launching interceptor-fighters (typically VF-17D Nightmare fighters). For defense, the Battle Class has a pin-point barrier system and a short range full barrier system to defeat incoming enemy fire. In accordance with UN Spacy military doctrine for all ships of the line, the Battle Class has a stealth composition.
The City Class ships are designed as the super-long-distance colonization vessels of the New Macross Class. These ships almost always remained docked to the Battle Class vessels except in time of battle when the carrier will detach from the power plant docking unit mounted at the fore of the City ship. Inside the City Class ships is a fully functional city of roughly 350,000 people beneath the main dome. Outside the main city dome there is docking bay island (approximately 300 meters long) and the event dome. The City ships are powered by a separate reactor and even feature a basic space fold system for short-range interstellar travel. The City Class ships have no weapons and the City ship docked with the first Battle Class, Macross 1, had no defensive system. However, later City Class ships are all designed with a defensive shell that covers the city section of the craft in times of emergency (though both docking bay island and the event domes remain uncovered by the shell).
Perhaps the most distinguished of this ship class is the Macross 7 of the 37th long-distance colonization fleet that took part in the Protodeviln War in 2045. The 37th long-distance colonization fleet consisted of 1 x Battle 7/City 7 (Macross 7), 1 x Einstein Research Experimental Ship, 1 x Hollywood Amusement Ship, 1 x Riviera Resort Ship, 1 x Sunnyflower Agricultural Ship, 1 x Three Star Factory Ship, 1 x West Point Class Macro-Training Base Ship, one or more Mark Twain VII Resort Ships, 45 x Guantánamo Class Stealth Carriers (for use in space), 20 x Uraga Class Escort Battle Carriers (for use in air and space) and lastly 120 x Northampton Class Stealth Frigates (for use in air and space). The ship-carried aircraft/spacecraft for the entire fleet consisted of approximately 1,800 x variable fighters (mostly VF-11C Thunderbolts), 600 x variable attack craft, 9 x variable bombers, 120 x electronic reconnaisance fighters, 60 x cargo plane/freight transports and 100 x liason craft. Total fleet count is 194 large ships and 2,689 small craft. Commanded by Maximillian Jenius, the Battle 7 participated in numerous engagements against the Varauta Army throughout the war. Both the crew of the Battle 7 and the colonists of City 7 worked together during the ProtodevilnWar to develop a highly specialized sound technology that was used by several City 7 citizens to combat the Protodevlin. The infamous variable fighter unit Sound Force was stationed onboard the Macross 7 and the pilots - who together formed the rock band Fire Bomber - lived in the "Akusho" (or Acshio) area, the docking bay island section of City 7.

<description>As the main variable fighter of the U.N. Spacy in 2038, numerous VF-11C Thunderbolts are stationed aboard the 37th long-distance colonization fleet as it is lead by the 7th New Macross class battleship. This version of the Thunderbolt variable fighter features enhanced navigational electronic equipment (this upgrade was eventually installed in all VF-11 fighters from 2040 onward, starting with the first squadron). In 2045 the VF-11C squadrons are deployed in combat regularly since the outbreak of hostilities against the Varauta. Originally the VF-11C benefited from improved safety features which jettisoned the entire cockpit section of the craft in the event of the variable fighter`s destruction. However, this feature has not improved pilot safety in combat against the Varauta and many ejected pilots find themselves subjected to the Spiritia draining weaponry of Varauta mecha. Nonetheless, the VF-11C remains the backbone of the UNS forces for deep space colonization fleets. With hulls painted in bright blue-white, the VF-11C variable fighters of the Macross 7 fleet serve with distinction under command of Captain Maximilian Jenius.

<description>The colony ships that pioneered the great migration into space eventually grew into entire fleets of vessels with populations in excess of a million people. As the size of these colonization fleets increased the time spent traveling through space became a more important consideration for the effect upon the populace. Specialized vessels were built to help fulfill the needs of the colonists who could be traveling to habitable planets for years before settling. The Riviera Resort Ships were designed as vacation vessels, with hotels and casinos for high-class leisure. These large spaceships are over 6 kilometers long and are designed for marine life cultivation and breeding. Underneath a massive transparent dome an artificial 3.6km diameter ocean has been built with a coastline over 10 kilometers long. The forward section includes a large starport for visiting craft and numerous searchlights dot the exterior hull.
As large and important vessels carrying some 100,000 people, the Riviera ships feature defensive options to be used in the event of an emergency. The transparent dome can be covered with an armored shell to protect the population inside and the forward section of the ship is built with a dock to accommodate an Uraga Class Escort Battle Carrier. When the 7th New Macross-Class battleship departed with the 37th long-distance colonization fleet in 2038, a Riviera Resort Ship was among the vessels under its command. The Riviera was also part of the Milky Road inter-ship network which helped ferry small passenger and transport ships in between the vessels of the fleet.

<description>Guvava is a Gyarashi from the planet Pukirases V. He is an intelligent rodent whose fur is so thick he resembles a tribble with eyes. He also has a tail, which he can use to swing and propel himself with, and short legs. Guvava was rescued from his predator-rich environment by Maximilian Jenius in 2036, who found him injured and alone while on a mission. Upon returning home, Max gave him to his youngest daughter, Mylene, to care for. Mylene, then five years old, immediately fell in love with Guvava and helped nurse him back to health. Though Guvava was initially withdrawn, Mylene always stayed close to him, taking him with her almost everywhere, even to school, and the two soon became good friends. Guvava grew to become fiercely devoted to his "mistress" and can often be seen perching on her shoulder. He is telepathically linked to her and can seek her out when they are separated, and understand her speech, though he can only communicate in squeaks. In the presence of danger he rears up, his fur developing angry spikes, and he will even leap to attack if provoked. During Macross 7, set nine years later (in 2045-46), Mylene and Guvava are almost always together, even during concerts and space battles. Mylene states that Guvava is not simply a pet but rather, is a part of herself and she cares for him as much as she does for her human/Zentraedi friends and family.
Despite his small size, Guvava helps to protect Mylene as much as Mylene protects him. In episode 12 of Macross 7, Mylene is kidnapped by infiltration agents of the protodeviln. Guvava uses his telepathic ability to transmit Basara`s music to her and she begins to sing. Guvava is then able to lead Basara and Ray to her location. In Macross Dynamite 7, Mylene is invited to dinner by a woman who works to promote her music. However, the woman secretly drugs Mylene with the intention of sexually molesting her. Guvava immediately runs off to alert Mylene`s friends, Veffidas and Ray, who quickly arrive and smash their way into the room to save Mylene. Ray later states that if it hadn`t been for Guvava, the woman would have likely succeeded in forcing herself on Mylene.

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>The VF-19 Custom is a remodeled unit that was utilized for preliminary testing preceding the adoption of the mass production model VF-19 Excalibur. A goal of the VF-19 Custom was emphasis on maneuverability and stability in contrast to that of the original YF-19 prototype. The VF-19 Custom featured a modified version of the prototype fuselage that balance the high performance inherited from the original unit. The VF-19 aimed to improve the balance by reworking the fuselage structure, but the VF-19 Custom daringly maintains high maneuverability by following the original YF-19 concept. However, it was "singing" that characterized the principal objective of the VF-19 Custom far more than the outstanding operating performance. The craft was entrusted to Basara Nekki of the rock group "Fire Bomber" through Ray Lovelock. Granting operation of the VF-19 Custom to Basara and Lovelock was for the purpose of verifying application of the craft to the top-secret military program "Project M", aimed researching song energy. On the battlefield the VF-19 Custom would bask in the media limelight. Behind the scenes, the military operated data collection on the VF-19 Custom and the craft was supported by the military via thorough maintenance.
On board the Macross 7 fleet in 2045, a special paramilitary unit made use of a customized VF-19 variable fighter with a bright red colored hull. This VF-19 Custom was built by the UN Forces and given to Ray Lovelock as part of Operation M, a classified mission to test the combat effects of culture via music upon a potential enemy. The unduly decorative design matches the brashness and audacity of Nekki Basara, the singer/pilot assigned to the VF-19 by Lovelock. The VF-19 Custom features minimal offensive weaponry and is armed with only a pair of laser cannons (mounted in the wing roots) and two internal missile launch systems (mounted in the engines/lower legs). The primary armament of the VF-19 Custom is an external speaker-pod-firing launcher pod with sensor, fore grip and stock magazine (mounted on ventral fuselage section in Fighter mode or in manipulator in GERWALK and Battroid mode). The shoulders/dorsal engine nacelles have installed audio and speaker systems as well as lightup projector systems. With the launcher pod and sound systems, Basara fires armor-penetrating speaker-pods into enemy mecha and directly transmits his music to the enemy pilots inside. For defense, the VF-19 Custom features a pin-point barrier system like all VF-19 variable fighters. The cockpit of the VF-19 Custom is redesigned to utilize a non-conventional control stick resembling a guitar, an instrument that singer/pilot Nekki Basara manipulates skillfully to operate the myriad controls of the variable fighter in combat.
The VF-19 Custom was originally intended as a first strike weapon for use against non-cultured Zentradi still engaged in hostilities across the galaxy with the Supervision Army. With this variable fighter, the UN Forces could directly assault and confuse the Zentradi forces by exposing them to culture through music, a completely foreign experience that proved very disruptive to their strictly military life. However, the VF-19 Custom and Nekki Basara in particular played a much larger role during the Protodeviln War in 2045. The Varauta Army consisted largely of brainwashed humans and Zentradi of Earth origin as well as Protodeviln possessing humans directly. The Protodeviln and their Varauta Army were vulnerable to particularly high intensity sound energy produced by certain individuals via life energy called Spiritia. These individuals, like Nekki Basara, were known as Anima Spiritia to the Protodeviln and greatly feared. When Sound Force was established, the spiritia of Basara and his band Fire Bomber were transmitted to the enemy via the Sound Energy Converter and Sound Booster technologies. These systems proved very effective in combating not only the Protodeviln themselves, but also in hampering function of the Varauata Army`s technology.

<description>The VF-17S is a variant to the standard Nightmare variable fighter featuring increased firepower and more powerful engines. It has become accepted practice in the UN Spacy to assign slightly modified variable fighters to team leaders and command officers so the VF-17S was built in line with that operational policy. Featuring a new head unit with one extra sensor installed, firepower is improved with four anti-aircraft laser guns rather than just a single pair of guns. The VF-17S is also designed with two Shinnakasu Heavy Industry/P&amp;W/Roice FF-2100X Custom thermonuclear turbine engines that provide an additional 9,000 kg [x g] of thrust. Diamond Force commander Lt. http://anidb.net/ch43638 [Kinryuu] piloted a VF-17S with a yellow highlighted hull while serving aboard the Macross 7 in 2045.

In December of 2045, the Einstein became very active after the discovery of Protoculture Ruins on the planet Rax. The extensive facilities aided the UN Forces as they examined all information gathered from the Protoculture temple. Advisor Exedol was a key figure in researching data gathered about the Protoculture and the Protoculture connection to the Protodeviln. All this research was conducted on the research ship and Exedol remained aboard the Einstein up until the end of the Protodeviln War in 2046.

<description>With each new class of variable fighter the UN Spacy has found it useful to assign modified variants to team leaders and flight commanders. The VF-19S is a variant built in line with that official doctrine and features several improvements from the standard Excalibur model. A new head unit was built to replace the standard "F" series model, but in addition to the standard central beam gun the VF-19S features four additional fixed anti-aircraft laser cannons mounted on the sides of the head turret. The VF-19S weighs slightly more than the standard model Excalibur (8.62 metric tons) but more than offsets the little additional weight with significantly improved engines. Two Shinsei Industry/P&amp;W/Roice FF-2550J engines provide the VF-19S with 12,900 kg [x g] more thrust. The VF-19S, like the VF-19F, appears in standard blue mass production colors but the "S" model includes gold highlights unlike the "F" model silver highlights. Second Lieutenant http://anidb.net/ch43874 [Docker] of Emerald Force was noted for flying a VF-19S during the Protodeviln War in 2045-2046.

The paramilitary unit consists of civilian singers/pilots from the rock band http://anidb.net/ch49391 [Fire Bomber] utilizing modified valkyries to use Sound Energy against the Varauta Army of the Protodeviln. http://anidb.net/ch14046 [Mylene Flare Jenius] is assigned the VF-11MAXL Custom modified with a unique guitar sound stick control mounted on gimbal-and-joint system with throttle and options control on slider for HOTAS control. Piloting this variable fighter http://anidb.net/ch14046 [Mylene] participated in numerous sorties against Varauta forces along with http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Nekki Basara] in the http://anidb.net/ch49268 [VF-19 Custom] and http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Ray Lovelock] and http://anidb.net/ch14970 [Veffidas Feaze] in the http://anidb.net/ch49490 [VF-17T Custom].
The VF-11MAXL Custom is lightly armed, like most of the variable fighters modified for use in the Sound Force unit. The head cannon and gun pod were removed, leaving only four missile launchers in the dorsal/shoulder sections, two internal engine/leg launchers and two laser cannons. The primary weapon is a speaker-pod-firing launcher pod mounted on the ventral fuselage in fighter mode or in the manipulator in GERWALK and Battroid modes. http://anidb.net/ch14046 [Mylene] uses this weapon to fire speaker pods into enemy mecha and transmit sound energy directly to the enemy pilots. The variable fighter is also equipped with a high performance audio system and speaker system (speaker units mounted nose in Fighter and GERWALK modes or front torsoin Battroid mode) and a lightup projector system. The VF-11MAXL has also been modified with enhanced engines and more powerful vernier thrusters for faster performance and greater maneuverability.

<description>http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Ray Lovelock] was approached by the UN Forces to once again serve in the military after his retirement under distressing circumstances. http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Ray] accepted the unique proposal and became involved in Operation M, commanded by Macross 7 Captain http://anidb.net/ch41156 [Maximillian Jenius]. Originally involving only two members (http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Lovelock] himself and http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Nekki Basara]) the initial mandate of Operation M involved the deployment of only one customized VF-19 variable fighter, piloted by http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Basara]. Later in 2045, the paramilitary unit Sound Force was established and http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Ray Lovelock] was assigned to his own variable fighter, a custom VF-17T valkyrie. The Special Technologies Group onboard the Macross 7 extensively modified a two-seater VF-17T with an internal sound system and more powerful engines. http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Ray Lovelock] would pilot this VF-17T Custom into combat along side Sound Force, with http://anidb.net/ch14970 [Veffidas Feaze] as copilot.
The VF-17T Custom is primarily deployed as a Sound Energy variable fighter. The VF-17T Custom is not a direct combat unit (similar to the http://anidb.net/ch49268 [VF-19 Custom]) and as such carries only two laser cannons and four micro-missile launchers for emergency use only. The primary offensive weapon is a speaker-pod-shooting launcher pod (mounted with exit port in ventral fuselage/lower legs, ejecting from lower leg section into manipulator for Heavy Battroid mode). These armor-penetrating speaker pods can pierce through the hull of enemy mecha and transmit audio from the Sound Energy Converting system oboard the VF-17T Custom directly to the enemy pilots. http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Ray Lovelock] and http://anidb.net/ch14970 [Veffidas Feaze], as part of the rock music band http://anidb.net/ch49391 [Fire Bomber], participated in numerous sorties with the Sound Force unit. Along with http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Nekki Basara] in the http://anidb.net/ch49268 [VF-19 Custom] and http://anidb.net/ch14046 [Mylene Jenius] in the http://anidb.net/ch49489 [VF-11MAXL] Sound Force could muster incredible amounts of sound energy for use against the Varauta Army as they fought valiantly in the Protodeviln War.

<description>Despite initial misgivings the UN Forces were forced to admit that Sound Force did have a legitimate effect upon the enemy, however uneven and unpredictable the result. As such, the UN Forces decided to expand the initial mandate of Operation M and create more units using sound technology. The units were called "Jamming Birds" and comprised VF-11D Custom variable fighters built by Macross 7 Project M Special Technologies Group. One lot of 20 craft was produced and flown by trained UN Spacy pilots along with a co-pilot performer who could utilize the sound technology system. Auditions were held for Jamming Bird hopefuls and a final selection of six singers and musicians provided the UN Forces with their first new recruits.
The Jamming Birds, unlike Sound Force, were a strictly regimented military unit and the VF-11D Custom variable fighters were fully armed combat craft. The VF-11D Custom is built with a special two-seat cockpit, a secondary transparent spherical canopy for the rear seat and retractable four-piece canopy cover for Battroid mode. The Jamming Bird also features a newly designed head unit with a visor-style main sensor. The most important modifications made to the VF-11D Custom are the sound energy converter system and the Sound Boosters. The added equipment and accommodation made the VF-11D heavier than the standard http://anidb.net/ch49261 [VF-11C]. To compensate for the additional weight, the VF-11D Custom featured enhanced engines for additional thrust, VF-19 model vernier thrusters and enlarged canard wings for better maneuverability. The Super Part Boosters enable the VF-11D Custom to achieve orbit and can be utilized both in the atmosphere and in space.
The first deployment of the VF-11D Jamming Birds in November 2045 was a complete failure. While the VF-11Ds and the sound energy systems were combat worthy hardware, the UN Forces failed to account for the human element of the assigned personnel. Unlike http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Nekki Basara] and http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Ray Lovelock] who had military flight experience and natural ability (and, to a lesser degree, http://anidb.net/ch14046 [Mylene Jenius]), the singers/musicians of the Jamming Birds fared poorly under combat conditions, unable to sing effectively due to both the emotional and physical stresses of variable fighter combat. Colonel http://anidb.net/ch44100 [Barton], the officer in charge of the Jamming Bird unit, refused to admit failure and continued with a training program for the civilian personnel. The Jamming Birds eventually became an effective fighting force against the Varauta, but only at the final stage of the Protodeviln War.

As the name implies, the West Point Class is a training ship and is equipped with numerous military facilities such as flight simulators for pilot training. In addition to training, the Begin Hill acts as a frontline command center for the fleet (in the absence of the http://anidb.net/ch49255 [Macross 7]) and also supports the fleet by replenishing supplies and developing weapons.

<description>In March 2040 the Project Super Nova Advanced Variable Fighter (AVF) competition ended disastrously for General Galaxy with the complete destruction of their second http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21] prototype variable fighter in the "Sharon Apple Incident". The UNG military decided to adopt the http://anidb.net/ch48621 [YF-19] design from Shinsei Industries and mass production of the VF-19 commenced as the new main variable fighter of the UN Forces. General Galaxy however bravely continued onward with their development of the http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21] and redesigned the brainwave control system so that it was not the primary control system of the craft. The active stealth capabilities and payload abilities of the http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21] were evaluated and General Galaxy produced the VF-22 Sturmvogel II as a special operations Valkyrie built in small numbers. It was a successful gamble for General Galaxy and in December 2042 the decision was made to formerly adopt the VF-22 Sturmvogel II as a special operations variable fighter.
The VF-22 Sturmvogel II retained many of the advanced technologies in the http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21] prototype fighter. The brainwave control system BDI (Brain Direct Image), the main improvement from the http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21], was significantly simplified and worked in conjunction with a primary manual operating system within a corresponding cockpit. Simplification of the BDI system reduced the enormous cost of the unit and the weight of the equipment. The cockpit is also redesigned with an overhead spherical canopy offering superior visibility in Fighter and GERWALK configurations. In Battroid mode the forward interior canopy is built with a large partial sphere monitor providing a 180 degree view forward. All three laser cannons on the http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21] prototype were replaced with converging energy beam guns for the VF-22 but the production model retains the four dorsal missile launchers (in addition to 4 ventral ports) and large missile ordnance stowed in three internal pallets. As a further refinement the VF-22 features two sensor units (one mounted to the rear) in a newly configured head unit as opposed to the five sensors found on the old http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21]. The VF-22 is also armed with two gatling gun pods with retractable stealth covers and includes a pin-point barrier defensive system.
The first VF-22S fighters were manufactured by the Macross 7 fleet Three Star Factory Ship under experimental license. Two fighters were produced and flown by http://anidb.net/ch41156 [Max] and http://anidb.net/ch41157 [Milia Jenius] in the final stages of the Protodeviln War in February 2046.
BDI system functions as a sub-system, assisting in weapons control, chaff, or smoke during air-combat maneuvers where high G`s are required
BDI system for assistance; engine block remains on main body in GERWALK and Battroid modes, enabling effcient use of main engine thrust and providing high mobility compared to past VFs.
