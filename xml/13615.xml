<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>Oscar Francois de Jarjayes was born the last of five daughters to the Commander of the Royal Guards, http://anidb.net/ch67413 [General François Augustin Regnier de Jarjayes]. She is raised by her father as if she were a boy in order to take his place and command the Royal Guards serving at the Court after he retires.
At the age of fourteen, as soon as her training in the basic military skills is complete, Oscar is given the task to protect the Dauphine http://anidb.net/ch51683 [Marie Antoinette] when she arrives at the French Court. Despite being raised as if she were a boy and dressing in males` clothes, Oscar is open about being female. Even as she embraces her femininity, she uses her male position to gain freedoms that she could never have as a lady of the court.</description>
