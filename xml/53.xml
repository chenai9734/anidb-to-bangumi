<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="129291">An anime that is a must see. Great story and funny to boot!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="109384">really a great combo of humor action and drama :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="226817">Indeed it`s a classic anime.
Comedy, Action, Gun-fight. For me, it`s kinda boring, the story progress so slow.
You might as well start watching at Eps: 13, episodes before that can be ignored or watch it for laughter/action.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="594612">The series is unusual in that it is set in a violent, dystopian world and yet the protagonist is a pacifist. Interesting.

The characters are amazing and offer many interesting views. they are a joy to watch whether they are enduring pacifists or death incarnate.

The series is a western: Expect lots of self analysis and "lone ranger" type characters. That being said, there is a surprisingly integral sci-fi element in the series that comes close to Ghost in the Shell levels in its scope.

The Ace main character will only use his weapons to protect and will fire purposefully non-lethal shots (he often won`t use any weaponry). It`s important to consider Vash`s upbringing when evaluating his pacifism and also that the series is an analysis of Christianity.

It`s up to you to evaluate pacifism in a violent world, but either way the series is very likely to entertain. Give it a shot!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="716480">A great one i can say. Good story with a great male protagonist with good character development. A western touch with sci-fi coming. You should see this, its worth the time.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="54199">Vash The Stampido! :D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="442226">I believe it is a great show and it`s worth the watch. Even though it`s rather old, it`s not horrible in animation (and I`ve seen some crappy stuff...)

I really liked most of the comedy elements in there, little did I feel it was exaggerating. Characters seemed to be everyday people, with inner demons of their own to fight, which led to a dramatic climax. And a great ending.</recommendation>

<description>http://anidb.net/ch4423 [Vash the Stampede] is a gunman on the run with a 60 billion double-dollar bounty on his head which has made it difficult for him to go anywhere without being chased and shot at. Every town he visits ends up being destroyed because of his pursuers, but miraculously no one ever gets killed.
http://anidb.net/ch9909 [Meryl Stryfe] and http://anidb.net/ch9910 [Milly Thompson] are two insurance agents that have been sent to find Vash the Stampede and keep him under surveillance so no more damage is caused. Meryl, who leads the pair, refuses to believe that the man they have met can possibly be the legendary gunman. This spiky-haired, gangly, young man is extremely friendly, a pacifist, hates blood and suicide, absolutely loves doughnuts, and is a dork and a crybaby, a far cry from a notorious outlaw. But there is more to Vash and his past than meets the eye...</description>

<name>psychotic</name>
<description>People suffering from psychosis can be described as having lost their contact with reality and deteriorated their social functioning to the point of becoming deranged. Sometimes, these people will try to achieve some absurd goal through trampling on other people, and that`s the point they become villains. Usually, psychotic villains will not show themselves to suffer from mental disorders at first, and will seem like completely normal people; however, as their story unfolds and the show progresses towards its climax, it is usual to have psychotic villains become more and more deranged, to the point of being best described by "batshit insane".</description>

<name>cyborg</name>
<description>A cyborg is a cybernetic organism (i.e. an organism that has both artificial and natural systems). The term was coined in 1960 when Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline used it in an article about the advantages of self-regulating human-machine systems in outer space. D. S. Halacy`s Cyborg: Evolution of the Superman in 1965 featured an introduction which spoke of a "new frontier" that was "not merely space, but more profoundly the relationship between `inner space` to `outer space` -a bridge...between mind and matter." The cyborg is often seen today merely as an organism that has enhanced abilities due to technology, but this perhaps oversimplifies the category of feedback.
Fictional cyborgs are portrayed as a synthesis of organic and synthetic parts, and frequently pose the question of difference between human and machine as one concerned with morality, free will, and empathy. Fictional cyborgs may be represented as visibly mechanical (e.g. the Cybermen in the Doctor Who franchise or The Borg from Star Trek); or as almost indistinguishable from humans (e.g. the "Human" Cylons from the re-imagining of Battlestar Galactica). The 1970s television series The Six Million Dollar Man featured one of the most famous fictional cyborgs. Cyborgs in fiction often play up a human contempt for over-dependence on technology, particularly when used for war, and when used in ways that seem to threaten free will. Cyborgs are also often portrayed with physical or mental abilities far exceeding a human counterpart (military forms may have inbuilt weapons, among other things).
Real (as opposed to fictional) cyborgs are more frequently people who use cybernetic technology to repair or overcome the physical and mental constraints of their bodies. While cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals, they can be any kind of organism.

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>adventure</name>
<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.

<name>alcohol</name>
<description>Alcohol (or more scientifically, ethanol), is one of the world`s oldest psychoactive substances. It is traditionally found in the form of a beverage such as beer, wine, or liquor, although in some contexts it can be inhaled to produce similar or intoxication, and some people prefer another way of consuming beverage-form alcohol.
Alcoholic beverages are many and varied, due to production methods (fermentation or distillation), source materials (grains, fruits, vegetables, other plants), added substances such as flavorings, and many more ways of defining different forms of alcoholic beverages.
Alcoholic beverages are divided into three general classes: beers, wines, and spirits. They are legally consumed in most countries, and over 100 countries have laws regulating their production, sale, and consumption. In particular, such laws specify the minimum age at which a person may legally buy or drink them. This minimum age varies between 16 and 25 years, depending upon the country and the type of drink. Most nations set it at 18 years of age.</description>

<name>post-apocalyptic</name>
<description>An anime that takes place on future Earth (or it could be an alternative universe) after a major cataclysm has occurred. World War III, an alien invasion, plague, global warming or some other general disaster are common themes to build a post-apocalyptic world upon, where the effects were severe enough that mankind barely survived.
The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologised). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in an agrarian, non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of technology remain. There is a considerable degree of blurring between post-apocalyptic fiction and that which deals with false utopias or dystopian societies.</description>

<name>important haircut</name>
<description>When a character cuts off his or her hair, it often symbolizes a rite of passage or bout of character growth. A princess striking out on an adventure, or a new recruit at boot camp, for instance. Hair is something that takes time and effort to grow, so parting with it voluntarily can be a powerful act.
This is particularly a big deal when women get haircuts. Yet in fiction, even an accidental hair slicing can leave a character with a surprisingly even cut.
In many religions (Western Christianity, Ancient Egyptian religion, and others) priests and/or monks cut/shave their hair. Roman Catholic nuns also tend to cut and mantain their hair short under their veils when they enter the nunneries. The cutting of one`s own hair is also a part of Buddhist mythology, specifically something done by Siddhartha himself early on in his path to enlightenment, so anime examples might draw from this as an allusion. There are also some cultures, including Native American and many Asians, where a person would cut his or her hair as an act of grief, disgrace, or even rebellion. In the Confucian tradition, hair (like the rest of your body) is considered a gift from your parents and may not be damaged without a very good reason. Furthermore, prisoners and psychiatric patients commonly have their heads shaved, often to prevent the spread of lice, but sometimes also as a demeaning measure.

Legato pledges to serve Knives, who gives him his name. During his time as a slave, he weaved thousands of special metal threads into his medulla oblongata. They are dispensed out of a skull-shaped emblem attached to his left arm. When released, the threads transmit electricity to control his victim`s muscles over. The threads themselves are only a few molecules thick and able to take over an entire town with ease.</description>

<description>Rem Saverem is a crew member of a "SEEDS" ship from Earth meant to populate another planet. On Earth, Rem had a lover named Alex, and she leaves on the mission after his death in order to start over. In the manga, during the mission a sentient Plant was born, named Tessla. The crew of the ship proceeded to perform tests, examinations and dissection of her until it ultimately died, actions opposed by Rem and her fellow crew mate William Conrad. Later, both Vash and Knives are born, and fearing for their safety she keeps it a secret from the other members while they are in stasis. In the anime the only sentient plants born are Vash and Knives, who she protects from being killed by the other members of the crew. She proceeds to mentor and teach them. Her teachings of love and peace, especially that no one has the right to take a life, have a profound influence on Vash. The reason why Vash wears a red coat is that Rem told Vash about her favorite flower, the Red Geranium which means determination. When Knives sabotages the fleet, putting it on a crash course with the planet Trigun takes place on, she puts him and Vash in an escape pod, but chooses to stay behind and attempt to prevent the crash rather than escaping her ship. She manages to undo Knives` tampering, allowing a number of the ships to land safely, but perishes as her ship explodes in the atmosphere; her last words to Vash were "take care of Knives".</description>

<description>Meryl Stryfe AKA "Derringer Meryl" and her junior coworker, Milly, are agents of the Bernardelli Insurance Society sent to evaluate claims regarding Vash the Stampede. She`s hotheaded and strong willed. Initially, she finds Vash to be a nuisance and dismisses the idea that he is the legendary Humanoid Typhoon. As time passes, she realizes that Vash isn`t the villain that he is made out to be nor the buffoon that he presents himself to be. Gradually, she comes to respect Vash and love him deeply, though in the anime her love is more romantic than in the manga. Although she doesn`t often fight alongside Vash, she hides many derringer-style "throwaway" pistols under her coat. In the manga she becomes petrified of Vash after she witnesses his Plant-like nature and sees through his eyes the destruction of July City. After Bernardelli shuts down while Knives is ravaging the planet, she and Milly assume support roles along with Brad and Luida to help combat Knives. At the end of the manga`s story, the two become investigative reporters for the planet`s first television broadcasting channel, continuing to follow Vash wherever he goes.</description>

She appears rather simple, but has a kind heart and also reveals a strength of character and genuine optimism. Milly comes from a very large family, and writes huge masses of letters to them constantly (known as "The Milly Monthly"). Milly manages to hide a very heavy concussion gun, referred to as a "stun-gun", under her coat. The shots, which pop out into the shape of an X-shaped claw, are so powerful they can even knock over trucks. Although she does not have a relationship with Wolfwood in the manga, events after his death indicate that she might have had a romantic interest in him. Her reaction to Wolfwood`s loss in the anime is considerably greater compared to the manga. The manga version of Milly has blond hair whereas the anime depiction has browner-colored hair.</description>

<description>Nicholas D. Wolfwood, also known as Nicholas the Punisher. Nicholas is a traveling preacher, but contrary to his job as a man of God he`s quite devious and violent, a foil to his companion Vash`s peaceful and goofy nature. Wolfwood often criticizes Vash`s philosophy of not killing, stating that one day he`s going to have to. Despite this, he adopts Vash`s non-lethal style though he still kills when he feels it`s needed. Wolfwood carries a special, large cross-shaped gun called the Punisher, which contains a large machine gun in its bottom section and a rocket launcher at its top. In the anime the sides hold several Colt handguns. Wolfwood`s background and development are almost completely different between the manga and anime versions of the character.</description>

They are both born during a mission to further the human race and are taken care of by Rem until Knives disrupts the course of the ships, causing them to crash. This event was known as "The Big Fall". While Vash believes all beings have potential for good and deserve life, Knives believes in the survival of the fittest. In the manga, after discovering experiments performed on another sentient Plant, Tessla, and watching movies of human history, he decides that humans are evil and grotesque and that they need to be eradicated, though most of his hatred of humans comes from their misuse and murder of his own kind. Vash does not agree with his plans and seeks to stop him and show him that humans can progress, while Knives seeks to dissuade Vash from basing his life around the "idealistic nonsense" preached by Rem and to join his side.</description>
