<description>The protagonist, Bottom Biting Bug XVIII (age 10), loves to happily sing and dance more than anything else in the world. When bitten by a Bottom Biting Bug, people with hunched backs will have their posture corrected, depressed people will start to laugh, and people who had no confidence will suddenly become self-assured - those bitten are cheered up until they seem like entirely different people. However, even the Bottom Biting Bug makes many mistakes... This story featuring typical scenes from everyday life will continue to evolve through the sort of humor that kids love.

<description>Short episodes are regular episodes that are much shorter than the standard length. This means up to and including 10 minutes; shows with episodes that are 11 to 20 minutes in length are http://anidb.net/t6494 [half-length episodes] instead.
Not to be confused with http://anidb.net/t6349 [multi-segment episodes], which are regular episodes that are split into several short segments (parts), usually with separate titles and independent storylines.</description>
