<description>Long ago there was a war in Heaven which resulted in Judas and Luca - two of the six specially-chosen, talented and strong Saint Beasts - being cast out and imprisoned in Hell for leading the rebellion. But before that Heaven had been a peaceful place where the angels happily lived their lives. In this time, Judas, Luca, Goh, Shin, Rey and Gai are adolescent angels in Heaven who, on the day of Benediction, are made into adults by the supreme god Zeus. With each of the six having their own special abilities and new adult bodies to get used to, opportunities to meet each other arise and new friendships are formed.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>elements</name>
<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<description>Shounen Ai means boys love, and thus explores what happens when two boys (or men) fall in love. This is not to be mistaken for http://anidb.net/t2723 [Yaoi] which is (or, at least, how this term is often used by the western audience) used in adult works. This is not; that means there is no graphical sex.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>Seiryuu no Gou</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The reincarnation of Seiryuu the Azure Dragon of the East (Spring). He is the leader of the Saint Beasts and the most powerful. He is heterochromatic (his right eye is blue while his left is red).
In Tenshi no Shippo: He is the last Saint Beast to appear, and his reappearance frightens even the goddess, who accidentally drops her staff in fear. He takes Yuki as his bride, since Oriental dragons, which Seiryu is commonly depicted as, are serpentine. He is clearly in love with Yuki, as she is with him. Sacred Power: Fang (Sword) of the Blue Dragon. Lightning Blast.
In Saint Beast: Gou is the oldest of the Saint Beasts (the four Saint Beast calls him Anija which means older brother) and tends to be very serious and in charge of the missions given to him by the Goddess. He has a deep friendship with Gai.

<name>Genbu no Shin</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The reincarnation of Genbu the Black Tortoise of the North (Winter). He is the sensible, calm and brooding member of the group and its second-in-command, leading it in Gou`s absence.
In Tenshi no Shippo: He bypassed Ayumi while she was doing groceries. He later saw her again when the three tricked Gorou into working at an abandoned site under the pretense of a part-time job but to use him as a sacrifice to revive Gou. It was here that he fell in love with her enough to save her from the collapsing building. He later made her his bride, both being closely related animals (shelled reptiles). However, when the four joined Gorou`s side, Ayumi unconsciously hints that the relationship may not be one sided even before her abduction, the same goes for Yuki and Gou and Tsubasa and Rei, and later perhaps, Tamami and Gai. His Saint Beast counterpart constantly wears glasses and has shoulder-length blue-green hair, unlike the original Shin, who only wore his glasses in disguise, as well as having shorter black hair. Sacred Power: Shield of the Black Turtle. Shell Shards.
In Saint Beast: Shin has an affinity for tortoises and plays the golden harp (or a harp-like instrument). He received the Shield of Genbu from Zeus (which is almost 3/4 his size and looks like the back of a turtle). He is very close to Kirin no Yudas and is very calm and quiet. He also has the ability to manipulate time but using such power has a backslash. First, he needs a lot of energy and also his life is at risk. He used it once and he was unconcsious for 1 whole week.

<name>Suzaku no Rei</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The reincarnation of Suzaku the Vermilion Bird of the South (Summer). He is the most feminine in appearance, behavior (though not as extreme enough to be considered homosexual, which he himself states).
In Tenshi no Shippo: He first appears to hypnotize Gorou while on a date with Tsubasa to a theme park to ride the ferris wheel, knowing full well of Tsubasa`s fear of heights. He later takes Tsubasa as his bride, since both are birds. When she later regains control of her will, she slaps Rei, without a care of who he was, to prove a point of how much grief and trouble they caused. Later on, even he notes that Tsubasa has feelings for him, but as he was leaving, he was contented with the result. Unlike his Saint Beast counterpart, his hair covers his left eye, hence the bishounen appearance. Sacred Power: Wings of the Red Phoenix. Talon Strike. Scorched Flame.
In Saint Beast: Zeus gave him the Spear of Suzaku. He has an affinity for birds of any sort, including chickens. Ray gained the ability to fly after he became an adult angel; his wings are gold in color. He is very close to Houou no Luka. He is also disgusted at humans because they eat fried chicken which happens to be Gai`s favorite food. Very good at cooking.

<name>Byakko no Gai</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The reincarnation of Byakko the White Tiger of the West (Autumn). He is the most impulsive of the group and is prone to wild fits.
In Tenshi no Shippo: He is the first to appear, attempting to run over Goro with a truck but is saved by Tamami, whom he later takes as his bride, both being cats. Though he complained about Tamami`s age at first, he really is fond of her, and always tries to protect her. Sacred Power: Armour of the White Tiger. Tiger Claw.
In Saint Beast: Zeus gave him the Armor of Byakko. Tends to be a little childish, inventive (but most of the time his inventions were useless) and full of energy. He has an affinity for felines. He likes to play pranks on Rei and is good friends with Maya. Gai has the ability to control and channel the laws of nature. When they descended on Earth, he has this favorite tv show called `Venom Saint` that shows an animation of their recent encounters (or more like a chibi version of them that is drawn rather differently) and seems like Maya also has taken a liking to it. Also, he liked the concept of `convenience store` and wishes that Heaven also has one.

Prior to the ascent to the Holy Summit to choose the Six Saint Beast, Shiva entered the Forest of Darkness and got a demon to attack Shin who nearly succeeded (he managed to poisoned him by inflicting a wound on his left biceps), if weren`t for the timely arrival of Judas. Shiva was the 5th candidate to reach the Holy Summit, but due to his encounter with the demon, Zeus (who sees everything with his transparent crystal ball) rejected him the position.

<description>The God Creator of all, has a long gray hair that is tied on the back and a golden staff. Zeus initiated a new system within Heaven that ranks angels according to their ability: High, Middle and Low ranking angels that caused disturbance among them. This new system made Judas uneasy because the previously kind hearted angels now treat each other as if they are competing for a higher rank. Middle ranked angels were envy of the higher ranked angels and looks down on the low ranking angels whereas the low ranking angels were envy of the middle ranked angels and therefore will do anything to be promoted. Also has an atittude that once an angel committed a sin, should never be forgiven and therefore were sent to purged - which means the sinners will be turned into monsters and thrown to Forest of Darkness and each year, the number of angels who were purged increases. And when those monsters escaped the forest, he sealed them within a box called the Case of Hope. But later, when he found out that humans were increasing in number and atrocities as well, he ordered Pandora to released the contents of the box in the human world.
