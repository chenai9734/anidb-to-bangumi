<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="11165">One of the best story developments around. A great anime untainted by all the ecchi and loli crap found in most anime today. Definitly for those seeking a decent anime to pick up.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="349657">The story and characters are good enough that I didn`t mind the bad CG in the first few eps.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="672527">About a boy who wants to become the greatest general. As expected there is much war and battles, unfortunately those severely disappoint. Strategy is elementary school level, and in the end every battle ends up with the two generals in single combat. Generals are immortal from time to time (handy plot armour) and possess superhuman strength (kill couple of 100 people single handedly in a couple of minutes) which makes the anime seem ridiculous (it first appears after all as a semi-realistic story based on history).
In the end it turned out to be more of a battle shounen with OP characters instead of really about war en generals.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="242315">If you like war epics, this is a must see.  If you like great storytelling, this is a recommended. It has all the makings of a great story:  Politics, intrigue, alliances, betrayals etc.

Also, I disagree with the reviews.  It`s currently 29 volumes and ongoing. This is an excellent anime deserving a 10. The art and voice acting grows on you as you watch it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="239259">except for the poor CG, the story is great and its very enjoyable to watch, you may find it difficult to adjust while watching all the crappy CG but after 2 eps or 3 you wont notice it, force yourself, you wont regret it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="554442">its just like the 90`s animes w/c emphasize on the Story side rather  than the graphics and ecchiness of the current trend today.
This is an excellent anime &amp; highly recommended for me</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="318178">I didn`t trust this anime too much from the beginning, but the story was rock-solid and even the character development seemed to progress smoothly so I became more and more interested. After having watched over 30 episodes it became clear: this is already something like a must see for anyone interested in the basics of fight and war. The story is rather straight forward, but always surprisingly captivating due to the huge risks the main characters are taking all the time - the protagonist though just seems to feel bad if there is no deadly risk involved - he sure gets his fill though, I bet. So enjoy watching - you won`t be disappointed!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="348650">Kingdom at first looked like a low budget failed attempt at forcing a series. It was really annoying at first to see the change between cg animation for battle episodes and traditional animation for less intense ones. But I`m glad I put up with it, because the story makes up for it; specially that last ark leaves you craving for more of it, and now that the second season is out I`m willing to recommend this series to anyone I know. The battles are good, the plot is above average, and if you can get used to the rushed first 10 episodes you`ll fully enjoy this.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="231435">if you love war this is one of the few animes that made my blood boil
simplistic in the design but with a good story that captivated me from the first episodes
imo is a must watch anime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="419080">to be honest i needed three trys to watch the show. the animation is really bad. after two or three episodes you start to addapt and it is just an epic anime with a lot famous Seiyū (among others the voice of Ichigo Kurosaki from bleach and happy from fairy tail), an story so great that you really forget about the grafic disadvantage 
and the opening is really something you have to see</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="198958">its a great anime with a very engrossing story...just have to endure the horrible animation &amp;gt;.&amp;gt;</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="130855">an amazing story, 1 of the best animes in this season</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="212383">Lets get this out of the way first. Initially the animation is complete crap...BUT GIVE IT A CHANCE!!! The setting, battles, chars, voice acting, plot progression make up for it in spades and the animation gets better with time. By the end you will realize what a golden gem this is. Can`t remember watching a better war drama than this!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="374141">You know, I almost didn`t watch the show due to it`s drawing style. However, I`m glad I stuck it out. And I`ll just note that the drawing, though imperfect throughout the series, grew on me. I found that I wasn`t paying attention to the visual imperfections as I watched the episodes. This anime is a must see. The storyline is one of the best I`ve seen in a long while. There aren`t many truly engrossing action animes now. Watch it. Now.</recommendation>

<description>During the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China, in the western state of Qin, lives two boys, Shin (Xin) and Hyou (Piao), orphaned by war. They spend their days in strenuous training with the goal of one day being great military commanders. The turning point in their lives occurs when Hyou catches the eye of Minister Shou Bunkun (Changwenjun), who gives him the opportunity to serve in the imperial palace.
However, a power struggle occurs shortly thereafter. Hyou is gravely wounded and barely escapes with his life to return home. He entrusts a map into the care of Shin. Following its direction, Shin encounters Sei (Zheng), the young king of Qin, who would in later life be known as Shikoutei (ShiHuangDi).

<description>The military, also known as the armed forces, are forces authorized and legally entitled to use deadly force so as to support the interests of the state and its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its citizens and the prosecution of war against foreign powers. The military may also have additional functions within a society, including construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding critical areas.

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Feudal Warfare is the warfare of the Middle Ages and therefore the setting must take place in a time line similar to that of Middle Ages or its Asian/American counterparts, or in a fantasy world. Generally it can be described the same way as the Military category, just that the weapons used are swords, spears, bows, catapults, cannons and other weapons used in the Middle Ages.
Note: Just because the anime contains a guy or a couple of guys with swords wondering about, doesn`t make it applicable for this category, unless there are larger military organizations/groups involved in armed conflict with each other, you might not want to add this genre.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<name>footage reuse</name>
<description>Footage reuse is the employment of a sequence of frames many times, generally as a side effect of a constrained anime production budget. This can happen by using the same footage once at a time, but many times over the course of the show, or by directly looping it. Types of scenes that tend to get reused include: transformations, such as those typical of superheroes or magical girls, characters that change into powered-up versions of themselves, or robots changing shape; attacks, especially when involving a series of steps that must be followed before the attack can be launched; and any kind of action that involves repeating the same movement.
This tag does not apply if the footage changes significantly between iterations. An example of that is the infamous Endless Eight arc of http://anidb.net/a6367 [the 2009 iteration of Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu]; even as the plot repeated itself, each episode of the arc showed it in different ways.</description>

<name>off-model animation</name>
<description>Anime shows tend to most often run on an already tight budget; some have even tighter ones. Thus, over the years it became a norm to invest more time and money into the first and last episode, leaving many episodes in the middle to stand severe budget restrictions. This sometimes results in episodes which particularly stand out due to the drop in artwork or animation quality; bar some basic framework, they often have little in common with the rest of the series.
One clue to upcoming off-model animation is the noticeable addition of many Korean names in the production credits, as farming out more animation to Korean artists is a nearly universal indicator of a production company trying to save money in all possible ways.
This effect is often called yashigani, after the infamous http://anidb.net/e4682 [fourth episode] of http://anidb.net/a403 [Lost Universe], Yashigani Hoburu. Another prominent term describing the same effect is "QUALITY animation", with capital letters meant to show contrast to actual quality. http://anidb.net/a4531 [Yoake Mae yori Ruriiro na: Crescent Love] is another legendarily terrible offender: the TV airing of its http://anidb.net/e63752 [third episode] had a perfectly spherical ball in place of what should be a cabbage; the "cabbage" was so egregious that it became closely associated with the anime itself, to a point the show would henceforth be nicknamed "Cabbage Love" among Western viewers.
One should not confuse the yashigani effect with art shifts that stem from guest staff, changes in main staff, intentional art shifts, and similar effects. Another effect one shouldn`t confuse this one with is the so-called DVD/BD enhancement, which is when a studio scrambles to meet the deadline for a TV airing and airs a half-finished episode but eventually fixes it for a disk release; for example, http://anidb.net/cr792 [Shaft] is particularly infamous for its disk enhancements, to a point it has become known as "Shafting", and they prominently feature intentionally weird character models, but they don`t often leave bad artwork on the disk release. Additionally, it should also not be confused with intentional lack of detail on background plane characters; this effect is instead when even the foreground has art quality shifting over time due to the aforementioned budget restrictions.</description>

<name>CGI</name>
<description>Computer-generated imagery (CGI) or computer animation is the art of creating moving images via the use of computers. It is a subfield of computer graphics and animation. Increasingly it is created by means of 3D computer graphics, though 2D computer graphics are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time rendering needs. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another medium, such as film.</description>

<name>3D CG animation</name>
<description>Abbreviation for "three-dimensional computer generated animation" or "computer graphics" (CGI). The traditional 2D art is enhanced by 3D imagery developed through computer modeling software. Done in the right way, this union of 3D in a 2D animated world can be a very beautiful relationship.
The difference lies in what lacks the traditional 2D animation all together and may give term to something produced entirely with 3D graphics (such as the 2006 remake of "Appleseed" , 2007`s "Vexille", the 2008 addition to the "Biohazard" series and the more well known "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within" and "Advent Children").</description>
