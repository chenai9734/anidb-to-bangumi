<description>Kurumi Mirai, a freshman in high school. In the Letran Magic and Magecraft School, the one institution that trains the top-class "wizards" of the International Mage Alliance, she has already secured top marks since middle school. And yet, when she reached high school and took the selection exam to get into the "Magic Group" class that trains wizards, she did not get in.
In the next class, there were students taking the test to become fully fledged wizards, and among them was a student whom Kurumi admired.
How will Kurumi adapt and grow with not being selected despite her boundless intellect? And what of the goals of the top-class wizard Minami Suzuki, Kurumi`s new homeroom teacher?
