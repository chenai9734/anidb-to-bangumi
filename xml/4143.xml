<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="558725">Strong anime about character development, bands and self achievement. A bit too much drama in the romance part for my taste, but on the whole it`s a great anime.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="254914">A well written story that kept me glued to the series till the final end.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="336403">One of the best animes i have ever seen and if you are reading this you should watch it too! &lt;br /&gt;For a anime that can make you laugh and even make you feel good it can drag you down to deepest level of hell in an instant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those animes that you can`t keep you emotions apart.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="338795">Stayed astray for a lot of time due to tags incoherence with my preferences and oh boys was I fooled. 
You can`t go wrong with this anime - it`s a gem. The believability of the characters and their actions is so real that it`s just brilliant. Romance and drama are mixed in a spectacular way creating emotional moments that will stay with you for quite some time.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="292998">Simply the best in the romance category. Also, amazing music!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="401111">Good lord, what is there to say about this one??  I didn`t even feel I was watching an anime with this.  I was so into the characters that they became real people for me, struggling with real issues that actually mattered to them. All the characters are very distinctive, especially the two main characters (both Nanas). Many people seem to think that Komatsu Nana was a slut, but this is not true at all.  She is just a young girl in the midst of growing up. She is very innocent and naive, and because of this, she follows her emotions without thinking sometimes.  And because she is so innocent and naive, she has never learned to deal with the strong emotions that are rampaging throughout her life.  That having been said, the last 2 or 3 episodes are very confusing, so plan on reading the manga also. So, collect your snacks, grab your hankie, and sit back and watch this series!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="608137">This is about love, fame, friendship, and sex.  The characters are interesting and well draw. The story is realistic, and full of emotions. It was good, but the ending is a cliffhanger, so something are left unknown. But that`s cuz they were planning for a second season, but the manga writer fell ill so the manga was never finish. This is a masterpiece and it is my all time favorite.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="79593">One of best animes i`ve ever seen (of drama ones). If u like to watch how people deal with unusual hardships put on their way... u got to see it. It`s most depressive anime i`ve ever seeon too, but for this one, it`s advantage :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can`t wait for 2nd season, hopefully there will be more :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="586959">A very mature anime love, relationships and what comes with it</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="432445">A beautifully rendered tale of friendship, love, fame, broken hearts, broken pasts, and the pain of living through it all. This is a story about two girls whose paths cross, and in the process bring together others into their orbit, before these relationships spiral and collide. The genuine emotional depth of the characters and the entrancing music will amaze you. A must for everyone, and in particular romantic drama fans. (I sincerely hope the mangaka will complete the story one day and we`ll get a second season.)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="326899">I`ve watched over 400 anime so far, red countless manga and it`s the fisrt one that made my cry. I just fall apart and cound`t bring myself together. Must see !!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="504638">Doubtless, Nana is one of the best shows I`ve watched in my life. The story of Nana Oosaki and Nana Komatsu is incredibly touching, amazingly developed and made me burst into tears more than once while watching those 47 episodes. It`s a shame the series doesn`t get a definitive end, but don`t let that stop you - the beauty of this drama is in its development and ability to get you in deep involvement with characters and the events that happen to them. A lack of closure here is an open door to endless possibilities of life.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="279427">must watch</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="41516">Probably the most realistic portrayal of complicated romantic relationships in anime industry with likable characters and fairly interesting plot. It`s really unfortunate that the manga appears to be on indefinite hiatus though.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="306318">Interesting and unique characters with a great touching story told in an exceptional way.&lt;br /&gt;Horribly depressing but worth every minute of it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="120720">I like music-centric anime, and the Rock theme was even cooler. But what makes me recommend it is the extent to which I could sympathize with the characters. It was amazing.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="287993">For me, Nana is the best shoujo. The storyline is great and the characters have complex personalities. Furthermore the story is so captivating, you end up living it with the characters.

A must see !</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="173819">An amazing story. Has great music, and characters you come to know very closely. A warning though: If you watch this, you must go and read the manga to continue the story, otherwise the ending will leave a very bad taste in your mouth, and we all know there is nothing worse than an amazing anime with a crappy ending.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="346737">It made me laugh, cry, hypnotized me and had me singing its OP and ED`s in my head forever... watch... NOW!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="385944">best anime ever
you should give it a try, you will not regret watching it</recommendation>

<name>horny nosebleed</name>
<description>In Japanese media, healthy young men who have no other sexual outlet will often suffer nosebleeds upon seeing the naked female body, or even just a pair of well-filled panties.
The nosebleed is, of course, a visual shorthand/euphemism for sexual arousal. It is commonly interpreted that way for males and females, with little trickles of blood indicating mild arousal, and gushing fountains of blood indicating erection/extreme arousal in both sexes. It can also be interpreted as shorthand strictly for erections in males. In that case, when blood shoots from the nose explosively, and in ridiculous quantity, the implication would be an ejaculation.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>medium awareness</name>
<description>Medium awareness is the situational and generally temporary awareness characters in works of fiction have and display of the very fact that they are characters in works of fiction. For example, they may comment about the background music, quip about the script or narration, complain about the roles given to them by the writer or their lack of screen time, see the subtitles that appear on screen, inform the audience about the arrival of the commercial break, and even use medium effects as tools. The most common form of medium awareness is known as breaking the fourth wall, in which characters speak directly to the audience, either to it as a whole or to specific members of it. The "fourth wall" is the imaginary "wall" at the front of the stage of a proscenium theatre through which the audience sees the play; it is a metaphor for the boundary between what happens inside the work, to the characters, and outside it, to the audience.</description>

<description>Since college/university students are typically at least eighteen years old, with stories covering mature everyday life topics, you will find the college setting quite often in seinen and josei anime.
Topics that can now be covered - as compared to High School settings - are higher education (i.e. coping with higher intellectual stress), the more adult party life (i.e. alcohol, smoking, sex), the issues of daily life vs. studying - especially when having to work to pay for bills, and finally the possible friction between those in and out of college.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

It celebrates the meeting of the deities Orihime and Hikoboshi (represented by the stars Vega and Altair respectively). According to legend, the Milky Way separates these lovers, and they are allowed to meet only once a year on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month of the lunisolar calendar. The date of Tanabata varies by region of the country, but the first festivities begin on July 7 of the Gregorian calendar. The celebration is held at various days between July and August.

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

Another use of narration comes in the form of a dominant voice belonging to one of the protagonists, intended only for the viewer and revealing the intimate thoughts to whom it belongs. This type of narration occurs frequently throughout the duration of the episode or movie.</description>

<name>rock music</name>
<description>Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. Musically, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass guitar and drums. Typically, rock is song-based music usually with a 4/4 time signature using a verse-chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political in emphasis. The dominance of rock by white, male musicians has been seen as one of the key factors shaping the themes explored in rock music. Rock places a higher degree of emphasis on musicianship, live performance, and an ideology of authenticity than pop music.</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<name>season</name>
<description>A season is a division of the year, marked by changes in weather, ecology, and hours of daylight. Seasons result from the yearly orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth`s rotational axis relative to the plane of the orbit. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth`s surface, variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.
During May, June, and July, the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun. The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December, January, and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere.
In temperate and subpolar regions, four calendar-based seasons (with their adjectives) are generally recognized: spring (vernal), summer (estival), autumn (autumnal), fall and winter (hibernal). Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring (prevernal) and late summer (serotinal) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four.

<description>He is the guitarist of Blast and was the only person able to befriend Nana Osaki during high school--which coincidentally began their shared love for punk music. He is friendly and optimistic, but at times, he tends to miss the focus of conversations around him. Before Nana`s "smoking ban", he`s the only non-smoking member of Blast. However, his threshold for alcohol is poor and he accidentally leaks many secrets while he`s drunk (most notably, about Nana and Ren`s relationship to Shin). Like Yasu, Nobu comes from a rich family (his parents own an inn). Despite this, he is still very passionate about music, even sharing Osaki`s dream of making it big with a band one day.</description>

In the past, he shared several ties with Trapnest`s members. Yasu and Ren grew up in the same orphanage and remained close friends when Yasu was adopted. He dated Reira while in high school and was jealous of Takumi`s success and influence on her, which he later relates as the reasons for their break up. Also, he`s the oldest member of Blast which Nobu sometimes teases him about (by calling him "old man").</description>

<description>Blast`s former bassist, Ren is actually Trapnest`s guitarist. He is very popular and his music is well-received by fans. He and Nana Osaki were once in a relationship when he was still with Blast. Ren is a big fan of the Sex Pistols; he participated in a tribute album to them, and wears a "Sid Vicious" padlock around his neck that he received from Nana. Ren grew up in an orphanage and learned to take care of himself by the age of 12. He finds school boring and only likes to play guitar, which he practiced alone to the point of perfection.</description>

<name>Ichinose Takumi</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The leader and bassist of Trapnest. He is quite handsome and has a reputation of being a playboy. Despite his raw sexual charisma, Takumi can also be a cold and controlling workaholic. His favorite brand of cigarettes is "Gitanes". Coming from a family with an alcoholic and bitter father, he and his older sister learned maternal independence at a young age due to his mother being bed-ridden with illness in the hospital. He looked after Layla since they were children and always harbored a brother-like care for her.</description>

<description>He is the drummer of Trapnest. Like Nobu in Black Stones, he`s the "clueless", loud-mouthed member of his band. As with the rest of his bandmates, he`s a friend of Yasu. His musical interest was awakened by Takumi during middle school. He hoped to achieve lots of attention from girls by playing in the band.</description>

<name>Takakura Kyosuke</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Junko`s boyfriend who currently shares an apartment with her. He is also good friends with Hachi and Shoji. His laid-back attitude to life may deem him a slacker in the eyes of many, but he is actually quite perceptive and he coddles Hachi more than Junko would like. Both he and Junko are studying to become artists (his art being Romantic and hers being Post-Modernistic). Although Shoji has said several times that he used to be a player, Kyosuke says very seriously that he would never cheat on Junko because he is afraid of losing her. He also says that he liked Junko the moment he saw her.
