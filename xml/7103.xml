<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="298033">Break Blade is a good mecha anime. It leans pretty heavily on the mecha part, so I`d advise it to fans only. However, it has a bit of magic too and crossover appeals may exist.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="382602">Retarded characters, ridiculous plot. But really awesome action.

[b]Recommended for Mecha Action fans.[/b]</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="345948">I will also recommend it for the same reasons:
1st. Great story and character itroduction 
2nd. Great animation (not to flashy and not to shaby)
3rd. Great promise of suspension and enjoymend</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="243082">Highly recommended, especially for Mecha fans, there where a couple of characters that annoyed the hell out of me (you know the usual too young, undisciplined and immature to be piloting such killing machines) but they were short lived thankfully and not thrust in your face all the time.

Love the animation, setting, story and characters in general, seriously under rated anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="403846">Even after a few months after it finished airing it still gives me chills whenever I think about it. Very interesting plot, intriguing battles, spot on soundtrack, not to mention awesome animations. 
 Since im sick of those crap animes for kids with retarded main characters and retarded dialogs that have been airing recently, this is very pleasant to watch.
 The only fault this anime has is it`s ending, they`d better continued this!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="240447">Excellent animation and great mecha-action. I also liked the OP and 6th ED.

The content and environment was well done, however character development is almost non-existent. 
Regardless I enjoyed it overall. Kind of slow and silly at the start but it got more interesting movie #3 onwards.

Here`s hoping for a continuation or even a remake once the manga is complete.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="296921">Those who know anime know that good story-telling is often rare. But take a look at this: complex story-line, solid presentation, well written characters, good dialogue. + beautiful but not overwhelming visuals, grand opening theme = anime gold! 
(only the fist 2 are out so far but this has lots of promise. forgive me for being an optimist.)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="527227">A must have for any Mecha fan, great story, clear artwork and animation, and character detail is well thought out, plus on top of all that there`s plenty of action all round.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="458489">A highly underrated anime. A must watch for fans of mechs, nah whom I kidding. A must watch for all.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="359893">I enjoyed this beyond belief. If there is a rating
higher than 10 I will give it that. WATCH immediately.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="190271">I`m actually dissapointed that its only an OVA, and that its releases are so far apart. Other then that I love it. For a mecha anime it is one of the best I`ve seen in a while. Great story, animation and characters.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="328504">In one word... AWENSOME!!! Must watch!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="378480">Highly recommended and eagerly awaited. I`m not a big mecha fan, so the opening kept me from watching until there were two eps out, but I do love science fiction first, and good fantasy well grounded in some kind of logic second. This has everything I love. Great story, characterization, animation (a fine balance between 2-D and 3-D as expected from Prod. I.G.) 

I love this. I`m looking forward to the remaining four episodes. I want to see them fansubbed... and I`ll buy them if they ever get released in the U.S.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="458726">Worth watching!
Grand OP! Great story! Good animation!
Must see!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="188268">at last, i got to see the last part and i get to tell it was a great show, i`d love to see more of this, where the hero is centralized</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="217458">High quality animation and music. Nice story and characters. Awesome show!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="479272">Very very good series. Balance action and drama. And you won`t find it boring from beginning to end. Everyone who likes mecha fights must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="442930">Great action with good drama.  I love how the characters grew to hate and try to kill each other through unfortunate circumstances and misunderstandings.  I just hope there`s more of this show in the future.</recommendation>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<description>A disaster is a large-scale situation that causes great loss of or damage or threat to life, health, property, society, or the environment, irrespective of its source or cause.

<name>war</name>
<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<description>Someone who has been rejected or excluded from the majority, or all of the social groups in an area (school, work, etc.). A person that does not fit in society.
They typically look slightly high or depressed and they are usually alone most the time. Some are alone because they are too snobbish and see themselves above everyone else. Others are alone because they want to be. 
They are usually the victims of every negative stereotype and rumour. Some might even be called “freaks”.</description>

<description>A little bit of the story is found after the credit titles. A little bonus for those patient enough!
This applies regardless of if the credits play over an ED sequence, or over the "regular episode" that continues to air into the credits.
A sequence at the end of an episode, showing what will happen in the next episode, is NOT a post-credits scene; that is a preview.</description>

<name>guns are useless</name>
<description>Guns are about as effective as throwing tissue while only manly things like swords, spears, and bare fists are any use at all.
If the weapon shoots a projectile faster than human eyes can track, it is useless. Most guns only serve as a filler for the protagonist to dodge all their shots so they can kill them with a "real" weapon.
The sniper rifle is an occasional exception to this rule. This is because it can be used to quickly and efficiently reduce the amount of character development the animators have to worry about.</description>

Feelings of any kind towards other characters are best shown by calling each other`s name, loud, REALLY LOUD. For better effect at least twice or thrice. For lover`s couples and mortal enemies it is a requirement to run towards each other while calling each other`s name, unaware of the surroundings.</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Rygart is the series` main protagonist at the age of 25. He was born an un-sorcerer, meaning that he can`t use magic, unlike the majority of the worlds populace. Before he left to see Hodr, he worked on a farm with his brother who`s also an un-sorcerer, because of this, his father sold all Quartz operated tools and worked with tools without Quartz. After his father took out loans, he was able to attend a military school where he befriended Zess, Hodr, and Sigyn where the four of them were known as "the four problem children of Assam`s Military School", him being known as the "King of Make-up tests". He hates violence and believes he can win via his opponent tiring out before him. He later becomes the pilot of the Dirfringe, an ancient mecha designed for only an un-sorcerer`s use as a Heavy Knight for Krisna. He originally joins the war to protect his brother and friends but later admits he`s really fighting to protect Sigyn.</description>

They went to the same military school as him, where she was known as the "Mad Scientist" for secluding herself in the school`s lab for 3 days and nights without eating or drinking. She pursues a career of science and cares deeply for her friends, to the point of pointing a gun at Rygart upon first seeing him to ask why he didn`t show up at her wedding and confirm that he doesn`t hate her. While she is the Queen, she rarely acts like one as she usually spends in the castle maintenance workshop tinkering with machines with the royal engineers. Even though she and Hodr are married, both of them are never seen sharing the same bed suggesting their union was an arrange marriage. It is later reveal Sigyn was in love with Rygart during their days in military school but Rygart purposely didn`t hear her confession to him when he returned to take over his father`s farm because he felt Sigyn deserved a better life with someone else. Even after being reunited and married, she still loves Rygart.</description>

<description>Cleo is 12 years old mech pilot who looks like a teenager which her friend Lee makes fun of her for being extremely developed for her age. She`s a quick learner, but despite this she is very clumsy and somewhat a slow thinker with other things. She states that her positive skills are cooking, laundry, and keeping watch without even getting tired. She and Lee graduated from military school after 2 years, when it ordinarily takes 6 years.
Lee later commits suicide to prevent from being captured under the belief that the enemy are barbarians, but Cleo believes Rygart killed her and initially wanted to kill him. After this, she meets Rygart in battle and shows a surprising amount of skill contrary to how she was before, almost fighting off Rygart. She is defeated shortly after securing Zess`s escape and taken prisoner, where she is treated very leniently and shares a room with Sigyn. She initially tries to escape by securing Sigyn`s gun and tries to kill Rygart, but fails because the gun actually had no ammo. She befriends Sigyn and doesn`t try to escape afterward.</description>
