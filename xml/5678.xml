<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="484425">I was interested in Itazura na Kiss because I heard it told a story that actually progressed, which is rare romantic comedy anime.  I wasn`t disappointed with the progression of plot; I was actually quite pleased.  Stuff happens.  Time passes, and the story moves forward.  

However, I didn`t enjoy the series.  Though the plot moved forward, the characters barely changed, even while aging--they remained the stereotypes they were in the first episode.  

The comedy ranged from slapstick to stupid, and the drama was always over-the-top melodramatic.  This is a soap opera.  Don`t expect more or less.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="419926">A very good story, with nice plot and nice flow in time. Also nice animation and music. A must see for funs and definitely recommended for all.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="425405">I went into this thinking "ugh well this should kill some time".  It turns out it is actually pretty good!  I like how the relationships in it aren`t all perfect and shiny and how the main character`s heart wavers from time to time.  It reminded me a little bit of Nana.  At any rate, I really enjoyed this one.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="507618">you? YES YOU! watch this! WATCH THIS NOW!

my. fucking. god. SUCH A WONDERFUL ANIME. the romance in there is amazing. the comedy is genuine. god i cant get over how much im obsessed with this. 

also, i LOVE the opening for this. i mean its the first anime ive seen with only a guy singer, but its so catchy. you`ll be humming it by the second episode. 

well, in the beginning, i thought it was just an alright anime. i mean the male lead was a douche, and the girl wasnt smart and had dickhole friends. BUT, as the series progressed, man it got great. it got addicting too. and i thought that half way through they would`ve have trouble coming out with any more interesting episodes, but man i was wrong. watched all the way to the end and i loved every minute of it. and the ending is kinda predictable, but its still a heart touching ending. ABSOLUTELY FUCKING LOVE IT.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on a shoujo manga by http://anidb.net/cr9468 [Tada Kaoru], serialised in Margaret.
It was love at first sight for http://anidb.net/ch6195 [Aihara Kotoko] as top student http://anidb.net/ch6196 [Irie Naoki] delivers a speech on the first day of high school. After two years of secret admiration, "I don`t want it" is the rejection she gets when she plucks up enough courage to hand him a love letter. Rejected, Kotoko vows to give him up. By a twist of fate, Kotoko`s house collapses; her dad and her put up at a friend`s place, who happens to be Naoki`s father. And thus, life with Naoki begins and Kotoko`s love for Naoki rekindles again. Much laughter ensues when scatterbrain Kotoko makes her countless advances — supported by Naoki`s wacky mother, http://anidb.net/ch6197 [Noriko] — on ice-cold Naoki, who ignores girls and is a genius at practically everything from studies to sports.</description>

<name>tsundere</name>
<description>Tsundere (ツンデレ) (pronounced /(t)sʌnˈdɪə(r)/ in English or /t͡sun.de.ɽe/ in Japanese) is a Japanese concept of a character archetype which describes a person with a conceited, irritable, and/or violent personality that suddenly becomes modest and loving when triggered by some sort of cause (such as being alone with someone). The inverse scenario, where a modest and loving person becomes conceited/irritable/violent, is also a tsundere.
The default state does not matter. The character can default to "tsuntsun" or "deredere"; the key concept is the fact that there`s a (generally very quick) flip from one mode to the other.
It can also describe a contradictory personality which is good-willed on the inside, but with a harsh attitude on the outside. Originally found in Japanese bishoujo games, the word is now part of the otaku moe phenomenon, reaching into other media such as anime, manga, novels, and even mass media.
Tsundere is a portmanteau of the two words tsuntsun (ツンツン), and deredere (デレデレ). Tsuntsun is defined as "aloof, morose, pointed", and deredere is defined as "exhausted, lovestruck". Tsunderekko (ツンデレっ娘) is a related noun, referring to a girl with a tsundere personality. Like nekomimi, tsundere is considered a moe-inspiring character trait. The concept has received increasing attention in Japan, with a tsundere cafe opened in Akihabara and tsundere-themed products released (like Tomy Co.`s portable television set), and the concept increasingly reflected in recent anime, from an extended discussion of the meaning of the concept and its origin on the internet in http://anidb.net/a4777 [Lucky Star]`s Lucky Channel segment to merchandise for http://anidb.net/a3651 [The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya] classifying the characters according to tsundere-ness. Another accepted definition of tsundere is a girl who has a combative attitude toward others but is also kind on the inside. She usually plays out as having an attitude toward the main character, usually a male, and often criticizing him in one way or another, but as the series progresses she eventually warms up to him and sometimes even falls in love with him.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

Topics that can now be covered - as compared to High School settings - are higher education (i.e. coping with higher intellectual stress), the more adult party life (i.e. alcohol, smoking, sex), the issues of daily life vs. studying - especially when having to work to pay for bills, and finally the possible friction between those in and out of college.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>coming of age</name>
<description>In the strict sense the Coming of age describes a young person`s transition from adolescence to adulthood. In anime the term is used in a more general sense where the protagonists have to face a challenge, make an important decision in their life, take on responsibility, or learn a lesson, and by overcoming these obstacles they reach a higher level of maturity.</description>

<name>adapted into JDrama</name>
<description>This anime is a http://anidb.net/t2797 [new original work], and it has been adapted into a JDrama.
A JDrama (Japanese drama), also called "terebi dorama" ("television drama") or "dorama" for short, is a Japanese live action television series.
Japan produces many drama series every year, from a huge variety of genres. Like anime, they generally air in three-month seasons or multiples thereof, with new shows airing every season. Some kinds of drama, especially the morning or afternoon ones, tend to be broadcast daily, while evening ones tend to be broadcast weekly, also like anime.
In exceedingly rare instances, a specific episode of a new original work anime can also be adapted.</description>

<name>spacing out</name>
<description>A comedy element: The character starts to daydream or fantasize about some topic. The typical complete lack of reality makes the spacing out funny. Especially when the protagonist mumbles to himself / herself and friends hear this. Promptly teasing the possibly lovestruck and very embarrassed protagonist.</description>

<name>happy ending</name>
<description>And they lived "happily ever after"... *sniff*.
All issues in the anime have been resolved, the love polygons sorted out, the conflicts resolved, the guy gets the girl (or the other way around), and everyone else lives on blissfully.
(Not very realistic, but then again this is anime.)</description>

<name>heart-warming</name>
<description>The story and its characters give off good vibes — includes elevated feelings of affection such as tenderness, sympathy and love, all in one package.
The kind of anime which leaves you with a warm feeling inside and you can not stop smiling while watching it.</description>

<name>time skip</name>
<description>The plot features at least one skip or jump in time.
Example: A skip from the present into the past, or time skips in increments, e.g. every hour there is a time skip by a day.</description>

<name>long time span</name>
<description>The anime spans a much longer than usual (for that genre) period of time, typically several years (possibly decades or even centuries).
Example: In a school setting this could mean the character development is followed from school through college right into working life and the founding of a family with children.</description>

<name>watercolour style</name>
<description>A watercolour or aquarelle is a painting method in which the paints are made of pigments suspended in a water-based solution. Some anime are created in the style of watercolour paintings, the watercolour style, usually with faded pastels that often give the show a warm and friendly visual presentation. In modern anime, this is generally achieved via computer effects that create an imitation of watercolour, rather than by creating real-life watercolour art. While the watercolour style is more commonly used for backgrounds, it is possible to create the entire anime in such a style.</description>

<name>faceless background characters</name>
<description>Unimportant random/extra characters that appear mostly as part of the background are often drawn without much facial details, normally to save money, effort and manpower for more important parts of the show. Sometimes, they have almost or no facial details, meaning their heads only have indications of the presence of parts such as hair or mouth, or not even that. This can go as far as only drawing an abstracted silhouette of the whole body.</description>

<name>family without mother</name>
<description>For some reason, the protagonist`s mother is no longer among the living. The much-too-early death was due to sickness or accident.
This plot device adds a certain degree of tragedy to the anime, and usually has repercussions on the rest of the family. For example: the grief-stricken father and children barely function as humans; the oldest daughter has an extra burden of raising the other children, additional emphasis is given to the only female child in the family, i.e. with bishounen brother and dad in a shoujo setting.
In rare cases the mother may still be alive, just not living with the rest of the family presently, i.e. on some quest or job and gone for a long time.</description>

<name>rivalry</name>
<description>Quite broadly used term describing a conflict, contest, struggle, or opposition of some sort.
Typical examples: The mostly comedic rivalry for the love of a protagonist in a harem anime (love polygon), the more "mindless" battles between wannabe delinquents in a school fighting anime, or the struggle between good &amp; evil in an epic conflict for world domination.</description>

<description>"TETSUOOOOOO!!" "KANEDAAAAAA!!"
"TAMAHOMEEEE!!" "MIAKAAAA!!"
Feelings of any kind towards other characters are best shown by calling each other`s name, loud, REALLY LOUD. For better effect at least twice or thrice. For lover`s couples and mortal enemies it is a requirement to run towards each other while calling each other`s name, unaware of the surroundings.</description>

<name>Engrish</name>
<description>Engrish is actually a mispronunciation of English, as can be the result of someone, who does not have English as their primary language of origin (such as Japanese or Chinese). Occasionally characters in the original Japanese dialogue version of an anime will speak in English... however; this often still requires the assistance of subtitles, for while the words are meant to be said in English, the sentence structure and letter pronunciation may still be strongly related to the person’s primary language.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The female lead. She has been in love with the handsome and clever Naoki Irie since their first year in high school after hearing his speech at the opening ceremony. After their new poorly constructed house was destroyed in a mild earthquake, she and her father moved into the Irie household, her father being a very close school friend of Naoki`s father.
Kotoko is not very smart, having been in Class F all through high school (Class F is the lowest) and a low status department at her university. She is however very spirited. She usually ends up in trouble and Naoki always saves her.</description>

<summary>When young Kotoko-chan, in the unintelligent F-Class, places her heart on Irie-kun, the top ranked student from A-Class, is it all for naught but pain? She finally, after many years, collects her courage and confesses, only to be torn down. Irie-kun even goes so far as to say he hates stupid girls (meaning her), he doesn`t even read her confession letter (which she poured her heart into so sweetly)! Will this one sided love continue in this adversity? And what`s this, she already has an extremely passionate admirer, Kin-kun? Yet poor Kotoko-chan`s day is not over. Tonight is the night she moves into her new house! Oh, the embarrassment though when a slight earthquake tiptoes through Tokyo, her house is the only one to have damage done. Oh, and how extensive it is! The house crumbles like a card pyramid. Now Kotoko-chan is without heart and home. Good thing her dad has a very hospitable friend that jumps at the opportunity to lend a hand to this family. But wait, his name is Irie-kun. It couldn`t possible be that... They are staying at Irie-kun`s house! What a twisted love chain it has become, and only the first episode!

<summary>Yes indeed, it is the renowned Irie-kun`s house. After some small talk at breakfast Kotoko and Irie are pushed out the door by Irie`s mother, and to school they walk together. But not happily. Irie-kun soon shows how much he doesn`t care for Kotoko-chan, or maybe how little he cares for human decency. While riding the train Kotoko-chan gets pushed off at the wrong station by the crush of the crowd. When Kotoko frantically tries to get on the train, the doors close and Irie-kun watches as the train slowly pulls away from Kotoko-chan, leaving her with the only options of running to school or being late. When Kotoko-chan confronts him about his rudeness he simply says for her not to talk to him and that he hates absent-minded girls more than stupid ones. After dealing with all of Irie-kun`s cold disdain, she decides to one up him in the upcoming exams. While studying at the house, Irie-kun`s mother shows Kotoko-chan pictures of Irie-kun`s sister - what!?!? Irie-kun was dressed as a girl, and a cute one at that. With one cute picture in hand and a dastardly plan she coerces Irie-kun into becoming her tutor for the exams. On the condition that she makes it into the top 50 students with the highest score, she`ll give the picture back. He grudgingly accepts and a truce is born. While studying the intense stressful attitude turns slowly into a less tense good-natured bit of bullying. There are even a few times when they fall asleep charmingly after studying late into the night. On the way out the door Irie-kun`s mother happily gives Kotoko-chan a good luck charm for the test and the two students head to school. Poor Kotoko-chan though, she clumsily misses the bus again, wait - Irie-kun put his hand in front of the door this time. Something must really be changing. Irie-kun might have a soul. Also, as they walk to class he says "good luck". The test is over, results are in, and Kotoko has made it at spot 50. She remembers the good luck charm and opens it to find a super cute picture of her and Irie-kun asleep while studying. Her friends find out and even though they promise not to tell about it, Irie-kun is teased about it somehow and angrily tells Kotoko-chan to stay out of his life.

<summary>How depressing. After Kotoko-chan and Irie-kun had gotten just a little closer, she inadvertently brings embarrassment to the one she loves. Now he will never love her. She falls asleep with tear-stains down her cheeks and her confession letter in her hand. When Irie-kun walks in to tell her it`s her turn in the shower, he on impulse decides to read the letter, his face is blank, and void of expression. At breakfast the table is full of talk of the Sports Festival. On a whim the family decides to watch as Kotoko-chan and Irie-kun participate especially since they happen to be participation in an event together. The differences in classes are pointed out when it shows the excited spiritful F-Class and then the boorish studying A-class. F-class pulls ahead and now it`s Kotoko turn to participate in the burrowing race. She is called to bring the person she loves. She runs over to ask Irie-kun but chickens out and asks his father instead. Then it`s on to the mixed relay, while they walk to the start Kotoko-chan taunts Irie-kun about how her class will win he replies by saying he hadn`t done his best before and that now he will. In the last leg it turns out to be Kin-kun and Irie-kun. Just as Irie-kun sprints across the finish line Kotoko-chan is pushed out in front of him and she gets run over. Kin-kun steams as Irie-kun carries her to the nurse. It seems they are getting close again, perhaps Irie-kun is used to having her around. Well, any good impression he may have made is thwarted when Irie-kun embarrassingly recites the letter she wrote him. Before he gets to the last part where she had written that she loved him, she jumps up and slaps him. At that moment the house goes up in chaos. Everyone had no idea that Kotoko-chan loved Irie-kun. Then Kin-kun jumps into the scene through an unlocked door. He proceeds to boast of his #1 passion for Kotoko-chan. He finishes his boast with the claim that, despite Kotoko-chan`s feelings for Irie-kun he does not reciprocate in the least. Irie-kun replies that people`s feelings can change, the person you hate might become the person you love. Everyone is taken aback and the story continues.

<summary>Geez, Irie-kun`s mama is really determined. Kotoko-chan and her friends have made plans to go to Waterland and (only thinking about Kotoko and Irie-kun`s future) she sends Yuki and Irie to Waterland just to try to get Kotoko and Irie into a romantic situation. Yeah I know, but anyways on their little trip Yuki tries to observe Kotoko at bit closer, so he asks Irie to go get him some ice-cream. While Irie`s out, to get Yuki`s ice-cream, Yuki switches from the part of the pool where he can stand on the floor, to the part of the pool where Kotoko and her friends are (where he can`t stand). Right when he lets go of the ladder he starts to sink because he can`t touch the bottom. Right after he becomes unconscious Kotoko saves him. During that time, Irie overhears these two girls about a little kid who almost drowned. Next, after he heard he hurried off without the ice-cream to see if Yuki is okay. When he finally gets Kotoko and the others, he realizes that Kotoko took very good care of Yuki, so he just stands there and smiles. Soon after that Kotoko decides to take everyone to the waterslides and when it`s her turn to go, down she goes. Once she starts going down, she gets a leg cramp, which paralyzes her so she can`t move. Once she gets to the bottom of the waterslide, Irie notices that she`s having a hard time getting out, so he pulls her up and out of the water just in time, and gives her foot a relaxing foot rub.

<summary>When Kotoko announces to Irie that during the capping ceremony/graduation all the male students in the medical department are to present flowers to the nurses they like, he tells Kotoko that he won`t be able to make it to the ceremony because of a meeting and that the whole flower giving idea was stupid. Then Kotoko is selected as the representative for her class and has to recite the Nightingale Pledge because she is Irie`s wife and because nobody except Moto volunteered but since the head nurse knows that Moto is a male and the tradition was to have female nurses to recite the Pledge, he wasn`t selected. Afterwards, Kotoko practices memorizing the Pledge but has trouble when Moto walks by reciting the entire Pledge perfectly. At that moment, Kotoko realizes that Moto really did want to be a female nurse because of an old movie he saw so she schemes a plan with him. Towards the end of the ceremony, Moto shows up wearing a female nurse uniform. The head nurse tells him to go get changed but Kotoko and the rest of the class objected so the nurse ended up capping Moto. Kotoko recites the Pledge perfectly and afterward, she stays behind in the cathedral and Irie shows up, shocking Kotoko. Irie apologizes to Kotoko because he didn`t make it in time for the ceremony. Four years later, Kotoko is a full fledged nurse but still acts like a novice since she runs in the halls and isn`t perfunctory. Her patient is an "old hag" because she makes Kotoko run errands. The patient also secretly took pictures of Irie and when Kotoko took a picture of Irie that her patient took, the patient tells the head nurse that Kotoko was stealing. The head nurse chastises her and sends her off. As Kotoko walks by Keita and his patient Kotoko realizes that Keita`s patient is in love with him even though he denies it. When she joins Moto and the other nurses, they tell Kotoko that Nobuhiro, a movie star, was in the waiting area. They drag Kotoko to find Nobuhiro and when they were standing in front of the T.V. a guy tells them to move and then they realize that the guy was Nobuhiro. They beg for his autograph but Nobuhiro tells them to stop bothering him. Kotoko stands up to him and Nobuhiro hugs her and says, "I miss you. Kotoko-san." However, Kotoko has no idea who he is.
