<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="780947">I have mixed feelings about this one i enjoyed it in the end mainly because of isla but the whole concept of giftia rubbed me the wrong way. Loved the op/ed songs and I think the ost is good too</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="729755">I don`t even want to think of this series. The main themes from episode 1 are simply that even when your time is limited, even if you have a date of expiration, you should make every moment up to the final count, and that not accepting this will only hurt those around you. It`s the type of anime that fully concluded, where I`d love to have a season 2, but a season 2 with the same cast would only harm the original work.</recommendation>

<description>This story takes place in a future not too far away when androids that look exactly like humans begin to spread across the world. The android production company SA Corp. produced Giftia, a new kind of android that has the most amount of emotion and human-like qualities out of any other model ever seen.
However, due to problems in technology, the androids have a service life, and once they pass that, they... Well, it gets pretty bad. For this sake, SA Corp. creates a terminal service in order to retrieve Giftia that have gone past their service life. A new employee at the terminal service named http://anidb.net/ch71017 [Mizugaki Tsukasa] forms a team with the Giftia http://anidb.net/ch71018 [Isla] to retrieve the other androids, but...

<description>An android is a robot or synthetic organism designed to look and act like a human.</description>

<name>robot</name>
<description>A robot is an automatically guided machine, able to do tasks on its own. Another common characteristic is that by its appearance or movements, a robot often conveys a sense that it has intent or agency of its own.
Not to be confused with android (human-like robot).</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Mecha in Japanese basically means mechanical things; everything from an electric whisk or a car to a spaceship or a robot. Here however we limit it to the more exotic things usually referred to as mecha anime: robots, whether controlled by a human or not, and their ilk. See Androids, Piloted Robots, Power Suits, Robot Helpers, Transforming Robots for a more specific classification.</description>

<description>Ah… first love. The love that is remembered the most fondly by the participant, as this is commonly what people experience when they first have a first crush, but it is also the love before the Second Love, if that should ever happen, and for a guy, he usually holds her memory very close to him if he is a widower whereas for young girls, the memory of the First Love they ever had is a special memory to them, especially if he later becomes the boyfriend they`ve longed for.

<name>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</name>
<description>The title of Philip K. Dick`s SF novel (movie: Blade Runner). 
The phrase implies a set of existential questions: Do artificial beings (e.g. Replicants, Bioroids, or other AI constructs) dream, feel, or have a soul? If memories can be implanted, what makes real memories real? By contrast — what makes humans human? What is reality? 
These are central themes e.g. in all of the Ghost in the Shell and Appleseed series / movies.</description>

<summary>New jobs are assigned to the group, and Isla and Tsukasa are given a job that involves retrieving a giftia that raised a young boy after the deaths of his parents, one of the so-called "android children". They are greeted warmly by the giftia, called Marsha, and meet the boy, Wakanae Souta, who is deeply troubled by the impending loss of Marsha, telling them that everything she tells them are all lies. They cannot accept his signature that way. The next day, Michiru hears about the story and offers to help since like Souta she was also an android child herself. They go over some old family pictures with Marsha and they tell him that the next day is the boy`s birthday, and they find the secret recipe for the strawberry tart that his mother used to make. Michiru suddenly shows up, changing her mind yet again, and with her help they manage to throw a birthday party for Souta that helps him to accept what will happen to Marsha.
Meanwhile, Mr. Yamanobe is called to a meeting with upper management and is told that his section`s overhead is the highest in the terminal services division, and he needs to come up with a plan to cut their costs or else one will be dictated upon him.
The day before Marsha is scheduled to be retrieved a man impersonating SAI`s terminal services personnel shows up at the Wakanae house, and tries to convince Souta to give her up to him.</summary>

<summary>As per company policy, Tsukasa begins living with Isla in the company dorm, however when they are home she is taciturn and just sits and practically ignores him. This bothers him so his colleagues suggest that he do various things to attract her attention, most of which fall flat in hilarious ways until Kazuki suggests that he ask Isla to go on a date on their next day off.
With the ruse that he wants Isla`s help in choosing a gift for a friend, she accepts, and they go to a shopping mall. He notices that she is still wearing the company uniform and so he buys her some casual clothes, and he remembers that he had seen her in the mall the day he first came to work, and asks her why. She tells him she was there to buy herbs at an herb shop at the roof of the mall, and he says that that might be a suitable gift for his friend. To help her choose appropriate herbs she asks him to describe this friend, and her description makes her think this friend is an annoying person.
Tsukasa sees an amusement park nearby from the roof of the building and invites Isla to go there, and he tells her that the gifts he had bought were really for her, and that he wants to be friends apart from their work relationship and to make happy memories with her. This last part troubles her and she leaves him behind. When he later comes home he sees Isla outside their unit, and she apologises for leaving him like that, and he gives her a small key fob he bought at the amusement park.</summary>

<summary>Tsukasa and Isla continue their work, and he finds that despite being a nine-year veteran of Terminal Services she seems to be much more clumsy than might be expected. Their attempts to retrieve an android in the role of a machinist`s apprentice go awry when she startles the android and his owner, and she trips and falls attempting to chase them. He learns that she has not been working in the field like that for some years and thinks that she just needs to get back into her groove. He watches her undergoing training. As such, he attempts to do some of the work of negotiating with the owners of Giftias himself, and sets out writing a manual describing the process. He manages to accomplish the retrieval of the machinist`s android in that way.
His colleagues however, know the real reason behind Isla`s quirks: she is very near her end of service as well, and will reach that point in about 2000 more hours.</summary>

<summary>Mizugaki Tsukasa reports for his first day at work at the android manufaturer SA`s Terminal Services section, but is unaware of exactly what his new job entails, as he obtained it through his family connections with SA`s upper management. He meets the members of the rather small section, and they explain to him exactly what they actually do: the most advanced androids produced by SA, the Giftias, have the most amount of emotion and human-like qualities of them all, however, due to technological limitations they have a limited service life, and it is the job of Terminal Services to retrieve Giftias that are about to reach their end of service. They work in teams with one Giftia and one human as an observer, to ease the human owners of Giftias into the process of letting go of their androids.
Tsukasa is paired with a Giftia named Isla, an experienced veteran of the job, and they watch the process of retrieval done by the Giftia Zack and his partner Kinushima Michiru. One such retrieval goes smoothly, the owners having accepted the passing of their beloved android, while the second one is much more difficult, the old lady owner slamming her door in the faces of Terminal Services personnel for the third time.
Tsukasa and Isla over the next several days attempt to reach the old lady, as her android`s service life will end in only a few more days. Isla tries to climb over the wall and in so doing is seen by the android, that is in the form of a little girl, and she convinces her owner to let them in. Thus they manage to reach the old lady and convince her to accept the retrieval of her Giftia.</summary>

They are later asked to assist a member of another Terminal Services section retrieve a giftia that has entered their area of jurisdiction, a giftia named Andy, whom Eru once knew before she was recycled, when she had the name Olivia. They succeed in retrieving the giftia, and Tsukasa is surprised at how direct Andy is in her duty despite the anguish of the giftia`s owner, He is later told that that is typical of how the other Terminal Services sections conduct business, and it is only the 1st Section that has a policy of caring somewhat for the emotional welfare of the owners of giftias that have been retrieved.
Eru maintains contact with Andy and they become friends, despite the awkwardness. She winds up telling Andy about the festival in her home town where she used to often go with Olivia, and now Andy wants to see it as well. To ease the awkward situation she asks Tsukasa to come along, and he persuades Isla to come as well. While they are having fun at the festival, Isla gets separated, and Tsukasa looks for her, until he sees her just as the festival fireworks reach their climax. He confesses his love for her, but flustered and confused she turns him down.</summary>

<summary>Tsukasa tells the boys of the 1st Terminal Services Section that he is thinking of asking Isla out on a date. They have varied opinions but Yasutaka encourages him to do so. Isla meanwhile has been trying to do all sorts of things for Tsukasa that wind up causing trouble, such as cleaning his desk and also disposing of papers he was still working on, and he winds up having difficulty asking Isla, but in the end he finally succeeds and she agrees to go with him, after he tells her that while it might not make her more useful it would make him happy. Michiru and Eru repair the dress Tsukasa had given her and she uses it on the day.
They eventually decide to go to the amusement park, where Isla shows him the bench where she used to sit and watch people smile as they went by, where she sat with Kazuki. They enjoy themselves at the park until at the Ferris wheel Tsukasa suddenly collapses. When they are at home he explains how that seems to happen whenever he has to do something important. She tells him about how she has only about a month left, and he replies as he told Kazuki that he wants to be her partner until the very end.</summary>

<summary>After their failure to save Marsha before turning into a Wanderer, Isla and Tsukasa are told to take a break from field work until Isla is declared fit to return to such duties. She remains in android maintenance for several days to check and repair her injuries, and they are relegated to desk duty. She tells Michiru and Eru about how she can`t stop thinking about him, which they misinterpret as her being in love with him. They help her essentially stalk him until they are caught, and then Isla tells Michiru that she can`t stop thinking about him because she doesn`t understand how he can go on smiling despite the incident with Marsha, and wonders if he has forgotten about it already. Michiru tells her about how, against orders, he went to see Souta to personally apologise for their failure, and that it seems rather that he is unwilling to forget, and it seems he goes on smiling because he is sad.
Just as Isla is released from maintenance Kazuki finally tells Tsukasa about how Isla is only a thousand hours away from the end of her service life. Isla passes nearby and hears their conversation. Kazuki gives him the choice of continuing his partnership with Isla or ending their partnership and waiting until another giftia is assigned to them. He declares that he wishes to remain with Isla until the end.</summary>

<summary>The false Terminal Services man came to Souta while Marsha was out shopping, but Souta told him this, but he had his misgivings and contacted Isla and Tsukasa about the incident, and they agree that the man must be a black market retriever. Tsukasa, Isla, Michiru, and Zack begin their search for Marsha, knowing that her time is running out and that she might soon turn into a Wanderer, a berserk android, if they are unable to get to her in time. Yamanobe has called his superior and he authorises R Security, a private security firm contracted by SAI, to handle the issue as well.
They spend all night searching but find no leads until the next morning they learn where the black marketeers are conducting their business. They are stopped by R Security personnel from entering the area but Kazuki admonishes their commander, reminding him of the heavy-handed way they dealt with the retrieval of the android that had stood as Michiru`s guardian, who had also turned into a Wanderer, and they are allowed to pass. They find the false Terminal Services man, who has been beaten unconscious, and Marsha, who has indeed turned into a Wanderer. Souta wanders into the area, and is attacked by Marsha, forcing Tsukasa to shoot her with a Terminator, a weapon capable of completely disrupting an android`s software.</summary>

<summary>It is the day of Isla`s retrieval, and neither she nor Tsukasa sleep. They clean up their apartment and when they get to the office Isla writes farewell letters to everyone. They go to the amusement park and visit all the attractions, enjoying themselves as much as they can, until the park is about to close. They go to the Ferris wheel and are permitted one last ride just as the park closes, and they ask what are the things that they love about each other until they are overcome by emotion. As the wheel reaches its highest point Isla declares that is where she wants it to end, and full of tears Tsukasa puts the retrieval ring on her finger, whispering to her at the last: "I hope that one day you`ll be reunited with the person you cherish" just as she always did.
Tsukasa is sent away for training for nine months and returns to Terminal Services to resume his work, and is assigned a new partner.</summary>
