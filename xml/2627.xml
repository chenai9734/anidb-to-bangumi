<description>Many nuclear explosion which covers surface of the earth met the spaceship which finished planets exploration and has returned to the earth in A.D.2062. The spaceship crash-lands on the seabed of Okinawa adjoining seas, in order to avoid radioactive contamination. A scientist couple RYU and YURI entrusted reproduction of the earth environment to their young daughter AMAMIKU, gave freezing sleep and entrusted future affairs to a super-computer and a robot.
The human beings who survived slightly abandoned the polluted ground 90 years after, and it was obliged to the life in a submarine city, it was on the verge of extinction with attacks of the uncontrolled neuron computer.
The story starts moving greatly taking advantage of the human patrol during the submarine probe having protected AMAMIKU. AMAMIKU on which the duty for reproducing a life on the ground was imposed fights against the enemy with the friends who were able to encounter finally in being solitary.
This is a 3DCG marine adventure animated movie describing the last fight which risked fate of human beings. BLUE REMAINS was depicted with the latest 3D computer graphics technologies and was reproduced the inside stage of the sea realistically and fantastically.
BLUE REMAINS is a work which asks the environmental problems and existence of human beings.</description>

<name>CGI</name>
<description>Computer-generated imagery (CGI) or computer animation is the art of creating moving images via the use of computers. It is a subfield of computer graphics and animation. Increasingly it is created by means of 3D computer graphics, though 2D computer graphics are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time rendering needs. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another medium, such as film.</description>

<name>3D CG animation</name>
<description>Abbreviation for "three-dimensional computer generated animation" or "computer graphics" (CGI). The traditional 2D art is enhanced by 3D imagery developed through computer modeling software. Done in the right way, this union of 3D in a 2D animated world can be a very beautiful relationship.
The difference lies in what lacks the traditional 2D animation all together and may give term to something produced entirely with 3D graphics (such as the 2006 remake of "Appleseed" , 2007`s "Vexille", the 2008 addition to the "Biohazard" series and the more well known "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within" and "Advent Children").</description>
