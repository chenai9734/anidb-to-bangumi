<name>content indicators</name>
<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>Nura Rikuo</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Rikuo is the title character and main protagonist of the series, an average 12-year old boy who inherited 1/4 of his grandfather`s youkai blood. In times of impending danger his youkai blood awakens and he switches into his night form to become the Master of the youkai (the master of all spirits). His youkai form is confident, strong and inspires "Fear" amongst his allies leading many to join him. Rikuo is destined to take over as the Third Master of youkai from his grandfather, though the main conflict for the first portion of the series lies in his rejection of the idea. As a child, Rikuo respected and looked up to youkai, playing pranks on members of the Nura house and often declaring he would become more youkai-like and take over as the Third. However, after a discussion at school, he came to realize the evil nature of youkai deeds and decided to set himself firmly on the path of living a strictly human life. Since then, he has attempted to become more like a normal human by doing all sorts of good deeds. Even though he appreciates all that his youkai underlings do for him, he is nevertheless desperate to prevent his school friends from learning of his connection to youkai. After being tested by Gyuuki he decides to take the position of Young Head and saves both humans and youkai.</description>

<name>Yukionna</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Yukionna is Rikuo`s trusted attendant and part of Rikuo`s new "Hyakki Yakou" who follows him to school disguised as Tsurara Oikawa, a normal schoolgirl. She is affectionate towards Rikuo and even gets jealous when other girls pay him attention. This is also reinforced by the fact that other characters express how bad a situation would be come if Tsurara were to see what other female characters did to Rikuo. She also admires Rikuo`s youkai form, because she finds him very reliable and magnificent. She is overprotective of Rikuo when he is his "day" or human form and expresses great concern for his well being, which is the reason why she is always around him at school (which causes misunderstandings and concern on Kana`s part). She also acts as a cook and, though her food is delicious, most of the time it is chilled or cold.
She also has a fear of Yura as she is an onmyouji and a rivalry with Kana (going so far as to nearly freeze her), however she protects as her death would sadden Rikuo. She is in Kyoto protecting the Investigation group along with Aotabou. Later, she rejoins Rikuo but is kidnapped by Tsuchigumo.</description>

<name>Nurarihyon</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Nurarihyon is Rikuo`s grandfather, known as the master of all spirits or as the Supreme Commander. It is said that he plays pranks and hates humans, but he doesn`t really hate them - rather, he doesn`t believe humans should interfere in youkai affairs. He dislikes the fact that Rikuo goes to school and acts human but respects his wishes.
400 years ago, he fell in love with Youhime and fought with the Hagoromo-Gitsune in Kyoto. He won and became the master of all spirits but at the cost of shortening his life span greatly. In his prime, he and Keikan Hidemoto were considered friends. Even in his old age, he can easily best "Night" Rikuo and Muchi. Normal demons feel so much "Fear" that he is invisible to them until he strikes, that is his "Meikyou Shisui".</description>

<name>Nura Rihan</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Rikuo`s father and the second head of the Nura group. The son of Nurarihyon and Yohime, he is a hanyou (half youkai) and the Nura group`s power reached its peak under his leadership. Mostly because of his wife, Yamabuki Otome encouraging him. He didn`t want Rikuo to know about the yakuza aspect of the youkai world, and raised the boy in such a way as to prevent him from learning of it. He was killed by Hagoromo Gitsune when Rikuo was young.
It was later revealed that before he married his current wife, Rihan fell in love with and wedded Yamabuki Otome, a beautiful ayakashi. However, due to Hagoromo-Gitsune`s curse on Nurarihyon (that his youkai bloodline would die out), they couldn`t have children. Blaming it on herself, Yamabuki Otome eventually left Rihan a poem grieving her infertility and disappeared, presumably dead. In a scheme to get rid of Rihan to revive Hagoromo-Gitsune, Abe no Seimei and Sanmoto Gorouzaemon revived Yamabuki Otome as a child or her younger self and Hagoromo-Gitsune, who possessed her body and fabricated her memories. As her form resembled his late first wife, Rihan got close to her. It was only then when Rihan turned his back from Hagoromo-Gitsune that she recited Yamabuki Otome`s farewell poem (The `key` to his death) and slashed him from behind, killing Rihan with young Rikuo witnessing his father`s death.
