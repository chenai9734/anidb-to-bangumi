<description>An old man who is the headmaster of a primary school bordering the ocean paints a picture of a whale, an animal he had seen so often off the coast when he was a boy and now sees all too seldom. He reminisces about his youth, when he simply considered whales a source of food, though he vividly remembers a time when a whale was speared by a whaling ship. He knew of no other way to treat whales then. But that day he sees the first whale he has done in a long time - and it is beached against the rocks. He races out of the school to come to the whale`s aid..

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>short movie</name>
<description>Typically used when an OVA only has one part and is less than the usual 20 to 25 minutes in length.
So instead of calling it a `short episode`, the `short movie` tag is more appropriate.</description>
