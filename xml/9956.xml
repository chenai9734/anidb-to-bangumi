<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<description>Any anime that is based on a role-playing game aka RPG. A role-playing video game is a video game which includes elements of non-electronic role-playing games. The player assumes control of one or several fictional characters (a party) who have joined forces in order to perform quests and overcome a great number of challenges and enemies, usually monsters inspired by fantasy, and, to a lesser extent, science fiction and classic mythology. During the course of the game the characters, or avatars, which are generally defined by quantized characteristics, evolve and improve in that their various attributes increase, as well as by gaining more powerful artefacts.</description>

<name>proxy battles</name>
<description>In our terms, a proxy battle is a battle where humans use creatures/robots to do the fighting for them, either by commanding those creatures/robots or by simply evolving them/changing them into battle mode. Often the training aspect is also involved, or in some cases the proxies are nothing more than holographic representatives of some other variation of competition (like for example a card game). While many popular shounen anime fit under this category, it`s not limited to shounen anime.</description>

<name>important haircut</name>
<description>When a character cuts off his or her hair, it often symbolizes a rite of passage or bout of character growth. A princess striking out on an adventure, or a new recruit at boot camp, for instance. Hair is something that takes time and effort to grow, so parting with it voluntarily can be a powerful act.
This is particularly a big deal when women get haircuts. Yet in fiction, even an accidental hair slicing can leave a character with a surprisingly even cut.
In many religions (Western Christianity, Ancient Egyptian religion, and others) priests and/or monks cut/shave their hair. Roman Catholic nuns also tend to cut and mantain their hair short under their veils when they enter the nunneries. The cutting of one`s own hair is also a part of Buddhist mythology, specifically something done by Siddhartha himself early on in his path to enlightenment, so anime examples might draw from this as an allusion. There are also some cultures, including Native American and many Asians, where a person would cut his or her hair as an act of grief, disgrace, or even rebellion. In the Confucian tradition, hair (like the rest of your body) is considered a gift from your parents and may not be damaged without a very good reason. Furthermore, prisoners and psychiatric patients commonly have their heads shaved, often to prevent the spread of lice, but sometimes also as a demeaning measure.

<description>The most common example is that of a voice, either that of one of the characters or entirely unrelated, that appears at the beginning of an episode to offer a summary or introduction, and at the end of an episode for closure or for a preview to hint upon what to expect next.
Another use of narration comes in the form of a dominant voice belonging to one of the protagonists, intended only for the viewer and revealing the intimate thoughts to whom it belongs. This type of narration occurs frequently throughout the duration of the episode or movie.</description>

<name>episodic</name>
<description>An episodic anime consists of many successive short arcs that are generally 1-2 episodes in length, with strong plot continuity within each arc but generally little continuity from one arc to the next. For long shows (well upwards of 50 episodes), the episode count constraint is less tight; for example, a show with close to 250 episodes would also be considered episodic if it consisted of a majority of arcs of up to 3 or maybe 4 episodes and possibly also very few slightly longer arcs.</description>

<description>Charmander known as the Lizard Pokémon, is a fire type Pokémon. The Name comes from "Charcoal" (a material used to Create Fire) and "Salamander". They are selectable as one of three "Starter Pokémon" at the beginning of the games of the main series of Pokémon RPGs that are set primarily in the Kanto region (Pokémon Red and Blue for Game Boy, as well as their remakes Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen for Game Boy Advance). Charmander are not acquirable anywhere else in the main series aside from Pokémon Yellow. Charmander is a Fire Dinosaur-Lizard Type Pokémon. It`s name is from the words char meaning to cook and mander meaning a salamander which is a lizard-like amphibian. The end of a Charmander`s tail is alight with a flame, and the flame`s status reflects both the physical health and the emotions of the individual. If the flame were to ever go out, the Charmander would die.</description>

<description>Caterpie known as the Worm Pokémon, are larval Pokémon found in the wild early in the Kanto and Johto regions. In main series Pokémon games set in these regions, Caterpie are among the earliest and easiest Pokémon species caught by players, as they are very weak. They can be evolved into their cocoon-like Metapod form and eventually into the butterfly-like Butterfree form. Caterpie in the wild employ biological adaptations to survive, much like real caterpillars, in that their green bodies are useful for camouflage in foliage, their eyes are patterned to scare away predators, their suction-cup feet allow them to climb any surface, and the osmeterium on their heads can project a horrid stench to repel predators. It bears a resemblance to the spicebush swallowtail caterpillar.
In the anime, Caterpie as the first Pokémon Ash ever caught in his trainer career, and it eventually evolved into a Butterfree and was later traded for a Raticate on the S.S. Saint Anne but is traded back later in the episode. Ash releases it later so it could mate with a pink Butterfree.</description>

<name>Butterfree</name>
<gender>dimorphic</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Butterfree is a dual-type Bug/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Metapod starting at level 10. It is the final form of Caterpie. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Butterfree resembles a vaguely anthropomorphic butterfly with a purple body. Unlike true insects, it only has two body segments and four light blue legs. The upper pair of legs resembles small, three-fingered hands, while the lower pair resembles long, digit-less feet. Butterfree has two black antennae, a light blue snout with two fangs underneath, and large, red compound eyes. Its two pairs of wings are white with black venation. Two oval scales on a female Butterfree`s lower wings are black, but they are white on a male.
As Gigantamax Butterfree, its size increases to gigantic length with altered look. The wings and its pattern changes to light and dark green color with white. The antennae change to bright green and extends to the point where the tip bends, and three red clouds surround it. The eyes changes to bright glowing red. A fur-like circle is attached to both the wings and back of Butterfree. Several green scales can be seen floating around Butterfree, which are its most effective weapons, capable of releasing paralysis, poisoning, or sleep. The massive wings are powerful enough to lift a 10-ton truck through a simple flap. The wind it generates can scatter poisonous scales throughout the area, making it dangerous to be near it.
Butterfree`s wings are covered with poisonous powders that fall off continuously as it flies. It will defend Caterpie from bird Pokémon using this powder. This powder also repels water, enabling it to gather honey even in the rain. Butterfree will roam up to six miles (ten kilometers) from its nest in search of honey, which it carries with the hairs of its legs. Sometimes it has territorial disputes with Cutiefly over fields of flowers. It also consumes sap from trees pierced by Heracross, as seen in the anime. Butterfree is found in temperate forests and jungles, but it has also been observed flying near the ocean as part of its migratory breeding pattern.
Gigantamax Butterfree is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Befuddle.</description>

In main series Pokémon games set in these regions, Weedle are among the earliest and easiest Pokémon species caught by players, and they are very weak Pokémon that are captured to be evolved into their cocoon-like Kakuna form and eventually into the hornet-like Beedrill form. Commonly spotted in the forests and grasslands, eating leaves, Weedle are well protected from predators by sharp two-inch barbs on their heads which secrete a strong poison, and another stinger is on each Weedle`s rear. Sniffing with its big red proboscis, a Weedle uses its extremely acute sense of smell to find the types of leaves it eats.</description>

<description>Beedrill, known as the Poison Bee Pokémon, are fully-developed, hornet-like Pokémon that have hatched from their pupal Kakuna forms. In main series Pokémon games, Beedrill are only acquired by training a Kakuna past experience level 10 and evolving it into a Beedrill; whereas many other Pokémon evolve into their final forms at much later levels, Beedrill`s early availability makes it a temporarily strong asset to Pokémon Trainers starting out on their journeys. Beedrill are extremely territorial, and will be set off by anything that approaches a Beedrill nest. When angered, Beedrill attack in a furious swarm, and the sharp ends of their stingers and the poison stored in their abdomens will definitely be put to use.</description>

<description>Pidgey, known as the Tiny Bird Pokémon, is a bird-like Pokémon, whose original name in the English beta version of Pokémon Red and Blue was "Pidge". Pidgey was first introduced in the United States in Red and Blue. They are one of the first wild Pokémon that players encounter in those games. Pidgey does not like to fight, and will use its wings to stir up clouds of sand in an attempt to distract its would-be opponent and escape. Pidgey also uses this technique to bring its preferred prey of small insects into the open. Pidgey seems to possess magnetoception, as it is capable of returning to its nest from any location without fail.
Pidgey also appeared in the first television episode, Pokémon, I Choose You!, when the main character, Ash Ketchum, attempts to catch one. He fails when it uses its Gust attack to blow him away and escapes. Afterwards, it uses its Sand Attack to blind Ash, allowing it to get away.</description>

<description>Pidgeotto, known as the Bird Pokémon, is a bird-like Pokémon, is a larger and stronger form that Pidgey takes when it gains enough experience. In the main Pokémon game series, a Pidgeotto is only acquired when a Pidgey grows past experience level 18 and evolves into a Pidgeotto. A Pidgeotto is extremely territorial, generally claiming a large area with its nest built in the center. Full of vitality, it constantly patrols its territory, mercilessly attacking intruders. They fly about in circular patterns while hunting, and can spot the movements of their prey on the ground no matter how high they fly. The Pidgeotto attacks with its wickedly sharp talons and carries its prey, including Exeggcute and Magikarp, back to its nest from as far as 60 miles away - or more.
Pidgeotto was the second Pokémon Ash caught in the beginning of his career, eventually evolving into Pidgeot.</description>

<description>Spearow is a small, bird Pokémon with short wings and a small, stubby beak. It is noted for being frail, but it makes up for that with its "Mirror Move" ability. It eats insects in grassy areas by flushing them out with its wings, and plucking at them with its beak. Its wings aren`t good for long distance travel or high flying, but it is able to fly at high speeds by flapping its wings very rapidly. It is very territorial, constantly buzzing about and calling with a loud cry that can be heard from half a mile away. It serves to scare away predators and keep in touch with other Spearow, which usually is used to alert them of danger. The golden spearow has golden wings and a golden beak, it also has a lighter color of brown feathers.</description>

<description>Fearow is a bird Pokémon that evolves from Spearow at level 20. It has a large wingspan; elongated neck; and thin, long beak; all characteristics being a radical departure from its short-winged, stubby-beaked pre-evolved form Spearow. Fearow uses its great wings to catch air currents and effortlessly glide over large distances for as long as a day without having to land or rest. It flies high into the sky, and swoops down at its prey. By using a combination of its neck and beak, it has a large reach, allowing it to pluck bugs from the ground or easily pluck prey from soil or water as it swoops down. If it senses danger, it avoids it if possible.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Pikachu is an Electric-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Pichu when leveled up with high friendship and evolves into Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone. However, the starter Pikachu in Pokémon Yellow will refuse to evolve into Raichu unless it is traded and evolved on another save file.
In Alola, Pikachu will evolve into Alolan Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone.
It also has a Gigantamax form.
Pikachu is popularly known as the mascot of the Pokémon franchise and a major representative of Nintendo`s collective mascots.
It is also the game mascot and starter Pokémon of Pokémon Yellow and Pokémon: Let`s Go, Pikachu!. It has made numerous appearances on the boxes of spin-off titles.
Pikachu is also the starter Pokémon in Pokémon Rumble Blast and Pokémon Rumble World.
Pikachu is a short, chubby rodent Pokémon. It is covered in yellow fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back. It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch for electricity storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is a patch of brown fur. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs.
The anime has shown that wild Pikachu live in groups in forested areas. Pikachu communicate amongst themselves using squeaks and tail-shaking as friendly gestures. In the anime, Alolan Pikachu are known to greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Electricity can be used to receive and send messages with each other, as well as other Electric Pokémon species. It raises its tail to check its surroundings and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups grow, they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. Pikachu forages for Berries, which it roasts with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that Pikachu inhabits a location is patches of burnt grass. It has been observed eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment.
Pikachu charges itself while sleeping overnight, though stress and a lack of sleep can affect this. It is able to release electric discharges of varying intensity. Pikachu has been known to build up energy in its glands, which it will need to discharge to avoid complications. It is also able to release energy through its tail, which acts as a grounding rod, as well as recharging fellow Pikachu with electric shocks. Pikachu can also electrify itself to use its signature move Volt Tackle.
Pikachu has three alternate forms: one, the Cosplay Pikachu appeared exclusively in Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. It is always female, has a black heart-shaped spot at the end of its tail, and can be dressed in any of five outfits corresponding to the five Contest conditions. The second form is Pikachu in a cap, which debuted as an event-exclusive Pokémon in Generation VII. It is always male and has seven variants, each wearing one of Ash`s hats from the anime. In addition to these two forms, many other Pikachu variants have appeared in various media. The last, Partner Pikachu is the Pokémon the player starts with in Pokémon: Let`s Go, Pikachu!. This Pikachu can be either gender, has higher base stats, and has access to moves that normal Pikachu do not.
As Gigantamax Pikachu, it becomes larger and chubbier. Its tail becomes longer and stores all of the electricity it generates, causing it to glow a bright yellow and enabling it to become as powerful as a lightning strike. Its power is equal to that a power plant; however, it is difficult to use it in peoples` homes since Pikachu can only remain in its Gigantamax form for a short time.
Pikachu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Catastropika, while Pikachu in a cap has its own exclusive Z-Move, 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt. Partner Pikachu is the only Pokémon capable of using Zippy Zap, Floaty Fall, Splishy Splash, and the Partner Power, Pika Papow. Pikachu is the only Pokémon capable of using the Light Ball item. Gigantamax Pikachu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Volt Crash.</description>

<description>Raichu is a taller, potbellied form that Pikachu takes when he is given a thunder stone, causing its tail to grow long and black with a lightning bolt on the end and fur to turn orange. It also has a white underbelly, brown stripes on its back, and yellow cheeks, in contrast to Pikachu`s red cheeks and Pichu`s pink cheeks. In the main Pokemon game series, a Raichu is only acquired when an item called a Thunderstone is applied to a Pikachu so that it evolves into a Raichu. Raichu can only learn moves in the Pikachu stage, so the only way to make Raichu learn more moves is by using a TM. Raichu can generate 10,000 or even 100,000 volts of electricity, enough to knock out Pokemon several times its size, such as a Dragonite, as stated in the anime. Raichu`s name is a portmanteau of the kanji 雷 rai, meaning thunder, or lightning bolt, and chuu, which is the Japanese onomatopoeia for a mouse`s squeak.</description>

<description>Sandshrew are a species of brick-skinned mouse-like Pokémon found in several regions throughout the Pokémon world. Despite its name, Sandshrew`s appearance borrows more from the armadillo or the pangolin than from the shrew; its primary means of defense when threatened is to instantly curl up its body into a ball, leaving only its tough skin exposed. When it is rolled up like this, Sandshrew has the potential to withstand many attacks, as well as being dropped from a great height (also similar to hedgehogs). Sandshrew`s natural environment is deep underground in arid, sandy locations with very little moisture, such as a desert. It chooses this habitat to keep its hide as dry and tough as possible, while the sand also provides it with good camouflage.
In keeping with its physical characteristics, Sandshrew has high Defense in the video games, but low Speed. From Ruby and Sapphire onwards, it has the ability Sand Veil, which increases its evasion during a sandstorm. Sandshrew also appears in the spin-off game Pokémon Snap.
A Sandshrew owned by A.J. is featured in the eighth anime episode, "The Path to the Pokémon League." It had many notable traits, such as the ability to withstand water and its knowledge of Fissure, which it used to dispatch Team Rocket.</description>

<description>Nidoran are a species of poisonous rabbit-like Pokémon found in the Kanto, Johto, and Sinnoh regions of the Pokémon world. Male Nidoran are classified as a separate species of Pokémon from the females due to differences in appearance between genders, such as the female being light blue and having smaller horns than the male. It should be noted that these were the first Pokémon to have known genders until the release of Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Silver, although they remain as separate species to this date. This Pokémon protects itself with its venomous barbs.</description>

Nidoqueen seem to be omnivores feeding on shrubs and fruit but they may snack on certain small Pokémon for protein. Also, Nidoqueen are much less aggressive than Nidoking and get along much better with others of their kind.

Male Nidoran are purple, and their horns secrete a powerful venom. The size of the horns determines the potency of the venom. Nidoran stiffens its large ears to sense danger.</description>

<description>Vulpix is a fox-like creature with six curled tails, based on the Japanese fox spirit kitsune. Most commonly female, Vulpix are especially known for being beautiful. As Vulpix undergo Pokemon evolution, their red fur turns pale yellow and they grow three extra tails. Vulpix usually have a friendly, if not spoiled, temperament. Because of the flame in their bodies, when the temperature outside increases, they let flames out of their mouths to prevent their body temperature from getting too hot. In the wild, Vulpix will feign injury to escape from more powerful predators.
During the first season of the Pokemon anime, Vulpix appears often as one of Brock`s Pokemon. It was given to him by a girl named Susie who felt she could not take care of it well. Brock, who felt he was only "babysitting", gives it back to Susie in the season four episode called "Beauty and the Breeder".
Its Japanese name, Rokon is a portmanteau of six (六, roku) and kon (from kon kon, an onomatopoeic word describing the bark of a fox), or an alternate reading of the Japanese word for kitsune (狐, kitsune), meaning fox - in this case, the reading is ko (こ). Its English name may have been derived from the scientific name for a group of foxes, Vulpes.</description>

Ninetales is highly intelligent and able to understand human speech, but also vengeful; Ninetales have been recorded as putting a 1,000 year curse on anyone who grabs one of their tails, which is a focus of the plot in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team. They, along with Vulpix, have keen senses of smell, hearing, and sight. It can only be obtained by using a Fire Stone on a Vulpix. Its Japanese name Kyuukon comes from a combination of the Japanese number 9, kyu, and the sound of a barking fox.
In the anime, Ash and the gang find an abandoned mansion and Brock is deceived by a Ninetales, whose master strongly resembles Brock.
Since it has nine tails, the Pokemon`s name is very commonly misspelled as "Ninetails." Even the Game Boy Color port of the Pokemon Trading Card game uses this misspelling.</description>

<description>Jigglypuff, known as the "Balloon" species of Pokémon, are characterized by putting their enemies to sleep by singing a lullaby. Before beginning to sing, they mesmerize the opponent with their soft, glowing eyes, and if they inflate themselves, they can sing for longer periods of time. They can easily adjust the wavelength of their voices to that of the brain waves of a sleeping being, allowing for their pleasing melody to put its audience to sleep. They sing without pausing to take a breath, so if the opponent is resistant to sleeping, they potentially run out of air.
In the Pokémon anime series, Jigglypuff is a recurring character who aspires to be a great singer after the inspiration of Ash Ketchum and company. Unfortunately for it, every potential audience falls asleep before the song finishes. Jigglypuff does not usually choose an appropriate time to sing and has been a hazard many times, causing Ash Ketchum and his companions to often find themselves running away from Jigglypuff. It keeps with it a black marker, its "microphone," and uses it to scribble on anyone who falls asleep while it`s performing.
Its desire to have someone listen to the entire song was finally satisfied when it encountered a Whismur, who was able to stay awake due to its Soundproof ability.
Also, Jigglypuff`s Japanese name, Purin, translates into "pudding".</description>

It evolves from Jigglypuff through a Moon Stone. In fact, it`s remarkably similar to its pre-evolved form, Jigglypuff, except the ears have grown larger and it now maintains an "oval" shape. Wigglytuff`s eyes are always covered by a thin layer of tears, so that if any dust gets into Wigglytuff`s eyes, it is quickly cried away. In the games, Wigglytuff`s fur is described to be "sublime", so much so that if two of them come into close contact with each other, they are difficult to separate. In the television series, Wigglytuff is generally accepted as the most powerful Pokemon.</description>

In caves and other dark places it navigates using ultrasonic waves. It appears that Zubat is weakened by sunlight, so it hides in caves or other dark places. At night, it will come out and hunt for fruit or Venomoth, or it sucks blood. The female`s fangs are smaller than the male`s.
In the anime, Brock catches a Zubat before entering Mt. Moon. Since then it has evolved to Golbat and then into Crobat. Crobat was given to Forest, with Onix and Geodude by Brock, becoming a Gym Leader.</description>

Golbat is a fierce, nocturnal Pokémon, residing in the darkness of caves, and is most active in the pitch black of night, especially if the moon is in its new phase. It is widely known and despised for its feeding behavior: Sucking fresh blood from living things in large quantities. Once it has found a living target, it attacks in a stealthy manner, often striking without warning from behind, to harshly bite down on its prey with its four sharp fangs strong enough to puncture the hide of any animal-like Pokemon, however strong the hide might be. It then proceeds to drink ten ounces of blood instantly. Golbat enjoys blood so much that it does not want to stop, even though a lot of blood will weigh it down enough so that, if it is able to even fly afterwards, it flies clumsily.
Surprisingly, after each attack and feeding sequence, Golbat`s own blood type changes into that of its victim. Once it strikes, it will not stop draining energy from the victim even if it gets too heavy to fly. Like Zubat, the female`s fangs are smaller than the male`s.</description>

<description>Oddish are a weed-like Pokémon found in all regions throughout the Pokémon world. (with the exception of Pokémon Blue and Pokémon Leaf Green) Oddish looks like a small animated onion/turnip plant with a rounded body. Its body is blue or purple with two small feet and red eyes. On top of its head grows a large clump of 5 long green blades of grass. Its name likely came from the words "odd" and "radish".
Oddish is a nocturnal Pokémon, using moonlight rather than the sun`s rays for photosynthesis. During the day, Oddish avoids the sun`s heat and brightness by burying itself into the earth, leaving only the leaves on top of its head visible above ground. In this way it disguises itself as a plant, misdirecting its carnivorous diurnal predators.
While buried, Oddish nourishes itself by absorbing nutrients from the soil using its feet, which are said to temporarily change into a root-like structure for this purpose.
Oddish has been known to use its leaves as hands, such as one who used this to climb a rope net and tried to fly like a Hoppip.
If anyone pulls at Oddish`s leaves and tries to uproot it while it is buried underground, Oddish will react by shrieking in a cute, high-pitched voice. This mirrors the behavior of the legendary mandrake in a similar situation, although it seems that Oddish`s squeaks do not have the same dire consequences as a mandrake`s.</description>

<description>Gloom is a flower-like Pokémon that is a larger and stronger evolution of Oddish. Gloom are obtained when an Oddish gains enough experience to grow up to level 21. Gloom can also be found in most grassy areas of most regions.
The fluid that oozes from its mouth is a sweet nectar that is used to attract prey. Once the prey is attracted, the nectar will cling to the prey, trapping it. The nectar mostly attracts prey that lack a sense of smell, as the nectar smells horrible.
As well as its nectar, the pistil of Gloom`s flower smells incredibly foul; it can be smelled from over a mile away. It has been found that approximately 1 in 1,000 people enjoy the scent that Gloom emits. Those that don`t enjoy the smell have been known to faint upon smelling it. When Gloom is faced with danger, the stench worsens. If it is feeling calm or secure, it does not release the horrible aroma. Oddly enough, people have been known to sniff Gloom, just to get a reaction. This is similar to real world drug addiction.
It is said to widely shower its attacks; with moves such as Stun Spore, Poison Powder, and Sleep Powder, it has the ability to cause status problems on its foes. It is also notable that Gloom has two evolved forms (from the second generation onwards), Vileplume and Bellossom. Unlike other Pokémon that evolve via level, Gloom will not evolve until it is exposed to an evolution stone; a Leaf Stone will make a Vileplume, while a Sun Stone produces a Bellossom.</description>

<description>Vileplume is a huge flower-like Pokémon that is a larger and stronger evolution of Gloom. Vileplumes can be obtained by using a Leaf Stone with a Gloom.
Vileplume is known for its extremely offensive stench that comes from its large red flower. Vileplume uses this stench in battle, catching its foes off guard when they start to back away from the horrible smell. However, Vileplume`s flower can actually be a hindrance in battle due to it being very heavy and bulky. Due to of its weight, Vileplume walks very slowly, and it often must use its hands to help support the flower. Vileplume can be found in forests and they like to stay low to the ground. When they sleep, their huge petals droop over their head and they blend in more with the plants around them. They also release toxic, dense pollen into the air in this position so animals don`t go near them. At night, they sometimes gather together to perform odd rituals - during this time they release toxic pollen to deter intruders. The white markings on this flower are larger in the female than in the male. Paul uses Vileplume to battle Tyrogue, but his Vileplume is useless for Fighting-type Pokemon.</description>

It is capable of living in or out of water; in order to live out of water, it must sweat to keep its body slimy. prefers to live underwater in ponds where there is less danger.
In battle, it subtly undulates the spiral-shape on its belly to put the foe to sleep, using a type of hypnosis. It is also capable of easily escaping the grasp of foes due to its greasy skin. Poliwhirl`s spiral goes in the opposite direction of Poliwag`s. Poliwhirl`s mouth is no longer visible after evolution, but it is concluded that it moved to the center of its spiral, since it now sprays water from there.
In the Pokémon anime, Misty had a Poliwhirl in the Johto series, which later evolved into Politoed. Red owns one in the Pokémon adventures which eventually it evolves into a Poliwrath.</description>

Poliwrath is only humbled in its pack by Politoed, the leader of Poli packs.
Poliwrath is a master swimmer in every respect, due to its highly developed body and arm muscles that never fatigue regardless of use. Thanks to its incredible stamina, Poliwrath is said to be physically able to swim the entire diameter of Earth`s Pacific Ocean without obvious effort, and its swimming efficiency allows it to easily overtake the best human swimmers in any controlled competition.
Poliwrath has made several appearances in the Pokemon anime, first appearing in "The Battling Eevee Brothers" and later as an opponent in "Charizard Chills" and "Hook, Line, and Sinker."</description>

Abra are described as sleeping eighteen hours a day to conserve their psychic abilities. They also constantly use teleportation while asleep; changing their location once an hour, teleporting away when they sense danger or are attacked, and creating illusory copies of themselves. This constant use of teleportation is Abra`s defining characteristic in the video games.
In the Pokémon anime, Abra appears several times, first in Episode 21, Abra and the Psychic showdown, where it is used by the Saffron City gym leader and evolves into Kadabra. Abra has also appeared in the episode Psychic Vs. Ghost! Midnight Showdown, where he appears to have a main role in the episode.</description>

<description>Machamp is a Fighting-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Machoke when traded. It is the final form of Machop. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Machamp is a large, humanoid Pokémon with four well-muscled arms. It has bluish gray skin, red eyes, and pale yellow lips. On its head, there are three brown ridges right above its eyes. It has two arms on each side of its body: a pair located in the normal position, and another pair directly above that attaches on the top of the shoulders. It has black markings that resemble briefs and wears golden power-save belt that resembles a championship belt. Its legs have considerable muscle tone, and its feet have two toes each.
Machamp punches extremely fast, throwing five hundred punches a second. With only one hand, it can move a mountain. Because of its four arms, it can hit from a multitude of angles and pin all of its foe`s limbs at once. Its arms also allow it to attack and defend simultaneously. The four arms react faster before Marchamp think. However, it has poor dexterity, and cannot handle delicate work without its arms becoming tangled. It is a rash Pokémon that rushes into action without forethought. Being the result of an evolution via trading, Machamp is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in the mountains. In the past, it claimed Low Kick, Vital Throw, and Strength as signature moves.
As Gigantamax Machamp, it has become larger with several changes. Its blueish-gray skin becomes darker. The middle ridge located on head becomes longer compare to the other two. All three ridges are also darker now. The neck extends with black markings. The fours fists are now colored dark orange with yellow lines connecting to two orange spots on each arm. The golden belt extends with several more dots. The P in the middle of the belt is colored white and connected to a single yellow circle with nothing in between. The black markings on its leg extend to the legs but stopping near the ankle.
Due to Gigantamaxing, the arms are filled with power, the punches it makes can hit as hard as bomb blasts. There is a legend where Gigantamax Machamp saved a large ship that was in trouble before bringing it to a port.
Gigantamax Machamp is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Chi Strike.</description>

<description>Bellsprout is a carnivorous, flower-like Pokémon, hunting small insects with blinding agility despite its skinny body. It is said to ensnare its prey in its vines and devour it, and can also spit a highly corrosive fluid that can melt even iron. Bellsprout`s preferred habitat is warm and humid climates, since it can absorb more moisture from the ground by planting its root-like feet. In battle, Bellsprout can take advantage of its flexibility to bend and sway its way out of the range of its opponent`s attacks, no matter how powerful they may be.
In the video games, Bellsprout is commonly found among grassy routes, and is used by many Trainers who favor the Grass-type. In Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, the Sprout Tower in Violet City is dedicated to Bellsprout.
Bellsprout has appeared numerous times in the anime series, most notably in "The Fourth Round Rumble," where Ash battled one during the Indigo League. He eventually defeated it with Muk.</description>

<description>Weepinbell is a bell-like Pokémon that resembles its pre-evolution Bellsprout, but without the vines and leaves. Instead of walking, it hops along or hangs on to tree branches and vines using the large hook on its rear end. Weepinbell immobilizes its enemies by using Poisonpowder and Acid. It will swallow anything that moves and digest it within its stomach, and produces a neutralizing fluid to keep from being affected by its own strong stomach acids. If its prey is larger than it, it will first use sharp leaves to slice it up before eating.
Players can obtain a Weepinbell by catching it in the wild, evolving Bellsprout upon reachng level 21, or Snagging a Shadow Weepinbell in Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness. In Pokémon Ranger, enemy Weepinbell can swallow the protagonist whole, knocking him or her back to the beginning of the area.
Weepinbell has appeared in relatively few episodes in the Pokémon anime. It first appeared in "The School of Hard Knocks," and later when Celadon City Gym Leader Erika battled Ash with one. James` Victreebel was also briefly seen as a Weepinbell.</description>

<description>Victreebel is a carnivorous Pokémon based on the pitcher plant. It lulls its prey with a sweet, honey-like scent, and also the vine on its head (which waves as if it were an animal) before digesting it with powerful stomach acids that can even dissolve bone. Normally, its prey are bugs, but it has been known to attack and consume small animals. Victreebel cannot be caught in the wild in any of the Pokémon video games; it must be evolved from Weepinbell with a Leaf Stone.
In the anime, James of Team Rocket had a Weepinbell which evolved into Victreebel in the episode "The Breeding Center Secret." As a running gag, it usually tried to eat him as soon as it emerged from its Poké Ball (this tradition of James`s Grass-type Pokémon hurting him was continued by Cacnea in the Advanced Generation series, and Carnivine in the Diamond and Pearl series). While most Pokèmon speak in a vocabulary consisting of its own name, Victreebel, like Lapras, communicates through loud, high-pitched shrieks.</description>

<description>Tentacool (メノクラゲ, Menokurage?) is an aquatic Pokémon based on the box jellyfish. It drifts aimlessly wherever the ocean currents take it, sometimes ending up in shallow waters where it may be accidentally caught in fishing lines. Tentacool may also end up stuck on beaches when low tide comes; since its body is largely composed of water, it will shrivel up, risking death from dehydration if it stays out of the sea for too long. Tentacool has two main weapons. At the tips of its tentacles are toxic feelers, which it uses to stab anything it touches with stinging acid. Due to its excellent camouflage in the water, Tentacool can often remain undetected by swimmers right up to the moment it stings them. Tentacool`s gelatinous, watery body can also absorb sunlight and refract it within, producing beam energy it shoots from its crystal-like eyes.
Tentacool is available in all Pokémon games to date. It is extremely common, especially while surfing on sea routes, and is in almost every single body of water.
In the anime, Tentacool was featured in the episode "Tentacool and Tentacruel" in which a raging mob of the titular Pokémon attacked the Porta Vista resort. The episode was banned after the attacks on September 11, 2001 due to its scenes depicting Tentacools and Tentacruels destroying buildings at a seaside resort.</description>

<description>"Tentacruel" is probably a portmanteau of "tentacle", the reason for which is obvious, and the adjective "cruel", referring to its personality. The name may have something to do with the deep-sea jellyfish called Tentaculata. Its name was originally going to be Man-O-War, which refers to the Portuguese man o` war. The Japanese name, "Dokukurage," is a portmanteau, of 毒 doku (poison) and 水母 kurage (jellyfish). It resembles its pre-evolution Tentacool to a small degree - the "head" of Tentacool has now been made into a hat-like shape on top of a black orb containing its eyes and two very large hooks which resembles a long nose. Also, unlike Tentacool, it has up to 80 tentacles, most of which are hidden, leaving up to 14 exposed.</description>

<description>Magnemite is almost more of a machine than a creature, as it is a solid ball of metal with a pair of horseshoe magnets on either side, as well as a single, lidless eye. It has a pair of screws protruding from below the eye, and a large screw forming a sort of "cap" on top of its head.
It floats through the air, through a sort of electromagnetic antigravity field generated by the two magnets on either side of its body. When defending itself in the wild or fighting in a Pokémon battle at the orders of a Pokémon trainer, it can also generate powerful electric shocks. Magnemite consumes electricity, so they`re attracted to power lines and electronic gadgets. Magnemite tend to crowd around generators and power plants, and an individual Magnemite might be attracted to someone with a pocket radio or a Pokégear.
Despite their mechanical appearance, lack of gender, and alien tendencies, Magnemite are living things; they are not built, they feel the need to eat, and they have something similar to a mating urge. A trio of Magnemite may come together to create their evolved form, Magneton.</description>

<description>Magneton is composed of 3 Magnemite linked together by a strong magnetic force. It levitates on an electromagnetic anti-gravity field like its pre-evolution, Magnemite. Its electromagnetic powers are so strong that it has been known to cause total blackouts in cities in which it gathers.</description>

<description>Farfetch`d is a dual-type Normal/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
In Galar, Farfetch`d has a Fighting-type regional form. Galarian Farfetch`d evolves into Sirfetch`d after landing three critical hits in a single battle, regardless of if it faints.
Farfetch`d is an avian Pokémon that resembles a light brown duck with a white underbelly. It has a flat, yellow beak, brown eyes, a V-shaped black marking on its forehead similar to a unibrow, and a three-feather crest on top of its head. Its wings are as big as its body and appear to be prehensile enough to substitute for hands. It has yellow legs with webbed feet and a stubby tail.
Farfetch`d is always seen carrying a leek stalk or spring onion. It carries this sprig in its wings, but sometimes chooses to hold it in its beak or feet instead. Unable to live without its stick, Farfetch`d will defend the stalk with its life. Losing it can leave Farfetch`d defenseless. Known uses for the stick include use as a weapon, nesting material, and emergency food source. It is selective about which sticks it will use and has been known to fight over good ones. Farfetch`d is found in temperate grasslands.
Galarian Farfetch`d is a deeper shade of brown, with a more prominent black mark on its head. As the leeks in Galar are much larger than those elsewhere, it carries its leek over its wing in order to better manage its heavy weight. It is renowned for its courage in battle.
Farfetch`d and its evolution Sirfetch`d are the only Pokémon capable of using the Leek item.</description>

<description>Doduo resembles an ostrich or a roadrunner, with sharper beaks and an extra head. It may also be based on the kiwi. Its name is a portmanteau of the words dodo, the extinct flightless bird, and duo, in reference to its two heads. Doduo`s tracks are huge and very distinctive. It inhabits and races across grass-covered plains at 60 mph. It is well-adapted to dry and arid climates. Doduo`s second head is said to have been formed by a sudden mutation thousands of years ago. Both heads normally contain identical brains, although rare cases have been observed where a Doduo has two distinctly different brains.
Interestingly, Doduo can be caught in the wild in all of the Pokémon video games. Doduo can also be found in Pokémon Snap.
In the Pokémon anime episode "Bad to the Bone," Jessie of Team Rocket battles a Doduo with her Arbok. The battle is interrupted when the Doduo`s heads begin to fight with each other.</description>

<description>Dodrio is a flightless bird Pokémon with long, powerful legs. Dodrio resembles an ostrich, and its movement is reminiscent of the roadrunner. Its name is a portmanteau of the words dodo, the extinct flightless bird, and trio, in reference to its three heads.
As the evolved form of the two-headed Doduo, Dodrio has three heads, the third head which is said to be formed by one of Doduo`s heads splitting during evolution. Each one of the heads constantly expresses a different emotion: joy, sadness, and anger. Having three heads allows Dodrio to collect more information from its surroundings, develop complex plans, and remain alert at all times by keeping watch in three different directions. On the other hand, a Dodrio`s three heads are commonly known to squabble amongst themselves, probably due to each one having a different attitude. Though Dodrio struggles to fly, it has three sets of hearts and lungs to match its heads, granting it extraordinary stamina while running at high speed. Like its pre-evolution Doduo, it inhabits dry, grassy plains.
In the video games, Dodrio are often used by Bird Keepers and Triathletes practicing in running. In Pokémon Ranger, a Dodrio is the partner of the Fall City Ranger Leader Joel. Dodrio also features in the Pokémon Stadium games as Dodrio Mode, which speeds up the games` GameBoy emulator, and in FireRed, LeafGreen, and Emerald in the mini-game Dodrio Berry-Picking.
In the Pokémon anime, Dodrio first appeared on the morning of the first episode, crowing in place of a rooster. Dario used one in the episode "The Flame Pokémon-athon," and Violet City Gym Leader Falkner battled Ash`s Pikachu with one. Gary Oak also evolved his Doduo into a Dodrio.</description>

<description>Gastly (Spirit in the Beta versions of the English language versions of Pokémon Red and Blue) is made of a very thin, gas-like substance, which grants it certain powers and weaknesses. Some say it is an other-dimensional lifeform, while others believe it is formed from toxic gas. It can sneak into any place if it so wishes thanks to the invasive properties of gas molecules. It can render itself nearly invisible and approach enemies undetected, and can envelop said enemies regardless of their size and induce sleepiness, slow poisoning through the skin, or even suffocation.
On the other hand, Gastly`s negligible weight and gaseous nature make it very easy for it to be blown off or even scattered to nothingness under a strong wind (although it is presumed the molecules can regroup later). A Gastly will not appear in windy weather if it can help it, but when it finds itself threatened by a strong wind, it clusters in groups under the eaves of houses to protect itself.</description>

However, when approached by people, it has a habit of reverting to a spherical form that obscures its eyes, mouth, and hands. Haunter is considered in the Pokédex to be a `gas type` Pokémon, because of the overall structure of his body. Because of its ability to slip through block walls, Haunter is said to be from another dimension. They seem to eat by first paralyzing their opponent with Lick, then draining a bit of their life force, although it`s possible they may eat other food as well, such things like Pokéblocks. It is also said to eat people`s dreams by going inside them and scaring them to death. It is the lightest of all discovered pokemon.</description>

<description>Gengar is a dual-type Ghost/Poison Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Haunter when traded. It is the final form of Gastly. It can Mega Evolve into Mega Gengar using the Gengarite. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Gengar is a dark purple, bipedal Pokémon with a roundish body. It has red eyes, a wide mouth that is usually curled into a sinister grin, and pointed ears. On its back are numerous spikes and it has smaller spikes on top of its head similar to tufty fur. Its arms and legs are short with three digits on both its hands and feet. It also has a stubby tail.
Gengar has the ability to hide perfectly in the shadow of any object, granting it exceptional stealth. However, Gengar`s body acts as a heat sink. Its presence cools the temperature of the surrounding area by nearly 10°F (5°C), because it absorbs the warmth. The anime has shown that Gengar can fly and possess people and other Pokémon. In the past, Night Shade was its signature move.
Gengar is very mischievous, and at times, malicious. It enjoys playing practical jokes and casting curses, such as pretending to be one`s shadow, then behaving erratically. When the quarry notices, the Gengar takes delight in its victim`s terror. However, Gengar has been known to be loyal to a Trainer who treats it well. Being the result of an evolution via trading, Gengar is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in caves and dark places where shadows form. It is especially fond of urban areas such as cities and back alleys, but only during the night.
As Mega Gengar, a portion of its body sinks into the ground and its arms and tail lengthen. The lower portions turn a more reddish purple, and a third eye appears on its forehead. This new unblinking eye is oval, yellow, and allows it to see into other dimensions. The spikes on Mega Gengar`s back are more numerous and pointed and additional spikes appear on its hands and tail. Its ears are now considerably longer and tilt backward.
Mega Gengar has the ability to access other dimensions and has a vicious nature. Mega Gengar has no itnerests in opponents unless perceived as prey. Its relationships are warped due to Mega Evolution. It now desires to take the life and curse anyone or anything in its path It may even curse its own Trainer. Mega Gengar sinks into an another dimension to wait for a chance to attack.
As Gigantamax Genger, it becomes larger with portions of its body sinking into ground. Only the head, tail, and arms remain. Also it changes to from a dark purple to lighter purple. The eyes change to the color white with yellow sclera. The inside of the mouth changes to resemble a tunnel with a long purple tounge sticking out. Three red clouds surrounds the top of Gengar’s head.
There’s a rumor where Gigantamax Gengar’s mouth does not lead into its body. Due the cursed energy, it’s believed to instead lead into the afterlife. By laying a trap, it hope to steal the lives of those it captures. Should someone stand near its mouth, they can hear the voices of their loved ones calling out to them.
Gigantamax Gengar is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Terror.</description>

<description>Onix is a subterranean creature that bores its way through the ground at a rate of 50 mph (80 km/h) in search of food. The tunnels it leaves behind as it burrows through the earth are used as pre-dug homes by other subterranean Pokémon such as Diglett and Geodude. Within Onyx`s member is a structure nigh identical to a magnet, which allows it to determine its heading, its depth underground, and other such information useful for a subterranean Pokémon to know. It acts quite like a compass. As Onix ages, it burrows deeper underground, and its rocky member becomes progressively harder, rounder, and smoother. Around the age of 100, the pressures exerted on its stone member become so high that it is compressed into a much harder, diamond-like composition, although it is closer to metal in nature.
In the anime, an Onix is owned by Brock as part of the many Pokemon owned by the training gym that Brock`s family runs. Brock had initially received the Onix from his father, who is a specialist in rock-type Pokemon. When Brock feels the need to travel with Ash Ketchum yet again, he entrusts the care of the Onix to one of his many younger brothers. This takes place in Pokémon Chronicles. It eventually evolves into a Steelix.</description>

<description>Voltorb are aggressive red and white ball shaped Pokémon that looks strikingly similar to a Poké Ball. Coincidently it was discovered shortly after Poké Balls were invented, some believe there is a connection. Though roughly ten times larger, many trainers get a surprise when they pick one up thinking it is a Poké Ball. The strength of their explosions is dependent on how much electricity they store in their bodies. When jarred or angered, a Voltorb can and will explode, causing massive damage to their aggressor and themselves (as seen in the video games when they use the moves `Self-Destruct` or `Explosion`, both of which causes fainting to the user). It is so unstable that even the slightest bump in the road will make it explode spontaneously. Voltorb do not have a mouth, but do have two eyes that are normally slanted into an aggressive or angry stare.</description>

<description>Electrode is a red and white ball shaped Pokémon that looks strikingly similar to a Pokéball with its colors reversed (white on top and red on bottom instead of red on top and white on bottom, like Voltorb). They are known to explode at the slightest shock and without warning. Electrodes feed on and stores electricity from power plants and lightning storms, but rarely do they use it to attack foes. It instead uses its stored electric to increase its rolling speed. The amount of electricity in an Electrode is relative to how powerful its explosions are. The stored energy also generates strong static electricity around Electrode`s body, sometimes paralyzing enemies on contact. If it is bored, it often amuses itself by exploding. Electrode has two beady eyes and an almost nonstop grin.</description>

The heads are considered fruit or nuts and each has a different expression on its face similar to Exeggcute. When an Exeggcute evolves into Exeggutor, any and all cracks and breaks are mended as they turn yellow and combine to form the new Exeggutor. Living in a good environment will allow it to grow lots of heads, and it is said that they occasionally fall off to form new Exeggcute.</description>

<description>Cubone`s name is a combination of the words cub and bone, in reference to its young age and relation to bones, both as weapons and armor. The "Cu-" may also be derived from cute, as Cubone is rather referred to as cute and lonely, or the derogatory term "cue ball", referring to a bald person, which is a reference to the skull it wears. Its Japanese name is most likely a pun on 空 kara (emptiness), 殻 kara (shell), and/or からから karakara (dried-up). In the Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow a Cubone is adopted by Mr. Fuji after its mother is killed by Team Rocket. Cubone is also a playable character in Pokémon Red Rescue Team and Pokémon Blue Rescue Team. The skull a Cubone wears on its head is said to be the skull of its mother, who dies whenever a Cubone is born. Because it never removes its skull helmet, no one has ever seen a Cubone`s actual face. Its cries for its mother are often heard echoing inside the skull.</description>

<description>Weezing is a Poison-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Koffing starting at level 35.
In Galar, Weezing has a Poison/Fairy-type regional form. It evolves from Koffing starting at level 35. All Koffing in Galar evolve into this form regardless of their origin.
Weezing is a purple Pokémon consisting of two spherical heads connected by a thin tube with another sphere in the center. The heads have differing sizes and features. The left head is larger and has prominent eyebrows, pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw, and two flat teeth in its upper jaw. The smaller, right head simply has two pointed teeth, one at each corner of its mouth. The larger head has a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking below its face, while the smaller head has a ring marking instead. It is covered with many geyser-like protrusions, which usually expel mustard-colored gases. Weezing is said to form when poisonous gases pool and two Koffing fuse over many years. Very rarely, two Koffing can become a Weezing in a short timespan because of a sudden mutation. Triplet Weezing have been discovered, although they are extremely rare.
Each of Weezing`s heads contains a different toxin. It mixes its gases by inflating one head and deflating the other. When its gases mix, Weezing becomes more toxic and putrid. Weezing can hover in midair, presumably due to gases lighter than air, as is the case for Koffing. Despite their stench and poison, Weezing`s gases can be used to make top-grade perfume by diluting them to the highest level.
Weezing lives in urban areas. It seeks a dirty, unkempt house and nests there. At night, when the people in the house are asleep, it will go through the trash. Weezing feeds on the dust, microorganisms, and especially gases emitted by garbage and toxic waste. Weezing`s body expands and smells worse upon inhaling poisonous gases. The Kantoian Weezing used to be common in Galar and created more potent toxins than their Galarian relatives.
In the Galar region, its appearance has changed due to absorbing polluted air from factories. It has a grey body with with the skull, crossbones, and ring changed to color yellow. Both heads have a hat-like tube located on top of them that constantly release purified air. Five green puffs of poison gas clouds can be seen floating around it. The larger head has a cloud-like mustache, while the smaller has clouds on its face in the shape of eyebrows and a beard.
Galrian Weezing consumes particles from the polluted air. It expels clean air instead of droppings. The toxins within Weezing`s body are accumulated into poison gas clouds that leaks and drifts around it. The gas is Weezing`s best weapon in battle, being potent enough to stun and immobilize an opponent with just a whiff.
Galarian Weezing is the only known Pokémon capable of using the the move Strange Steam.</description>

Its Japanese name is a portmanteau of sai (犀), meaning rhinoceros and horn (ホーン). Rhyhorn are easily angered and will not hesitate to charge at what ever or who ever angered it. Rhyhorn are powerful enough to topple buildings with their tackle. Rhyhorn are prime examples of "more brawn than brains", as they often charge head first into things but forget why. In Gold, Silver, and Crystal, Brock uses a Rhyhorn to battle. There is also a Rhyhorn in the Brock Gym Leader set of the trading card game.</description>

<description>Seaking is a goldfish Pokemon. The "sea" in Seaking`s name refers to the fact that it is a water-inhabiting Pokemon. "King" is probably a reference to its unevolved form`s name, Goldeen (a portmanteau of "gold" and "queen"). Hence, its name means "king of the sea." Its Japanese name refers to Azumanishiki (東錦) for one kind of "goldfish" and Ou (王) for "king". Seaking was originally called Neptune in the beta. Seaking is a goldfish Pokemon with a sharp horn, much like a narwhal. It uses the horn for boring holes in a rock for its nest. In spawning season, they can be seen swimming up rivers and streams.</description>

<description>Starmie is an aquatic starfish Pokémon that evolves from Staryu through use of a Water Stone. It moves through the water by spinning its star-shaped body in a manner like that of a propeller. It consists of two five-point, purple star-shaped structures superimposed on top of each other. At its center is a large gem, surrounded by a golden crest like structure. Starmie`s center section - the gem - is known as its "core". This gem is considered very valuable among collectors. The gem`s hue can change to any color in the visual spectrum, earning Starmie the nickname "the gem of the sea". When Starmie is weak, the core grows dim and starts flickering whilst producing distinctive warning sounds.
In the Pokémon world, the aforementioned peculiar properties of Starmie`s anatomy leads some people to theorize that Starmie`s origins are not of this planet, and that its luminescent core is used to send electromagnetic signals into outer space. It may have some connection with Deoxys having a similar core and the ability to regenerate. In ancient times, Starmie was attributed an equally mystical origin: that it was created from the reflection of the stars upon the waves at night.
In the anime, Starmie is one of the Pokémon used in Misty`s team during the most of the Kanto arc, along with its pre-evolved form, Staryu. Misty also often used Starmie outside of battle for transportation through water or for fire-fighting purposes. Misty eventually left Starmie in the care of her sisters at the Cerulean City Gym, and later reobtained it upon her return.</description>

<description>Magikarp is a commonly found Pokémon that can survive in rivers, lakes,and oceans. Despite its adaptability, the Pokédex states that the Magikarp species has grown weaker over time, and it is one of the least viable for battling in the series. It eventually evolves into another, far more powerful Pokémon, Gyarados.
Magikarp is commonly thought of as the weakest Pokémon. They are only able to learn three moves: Splash (does absolutely nothing), Tackle (a weak attack), and Flail (which does more damage as Magikarp is more damaged.)
In the anime, Magikarp has appeared several times, most notably as the subject of a running gag in which a salesman attempts to trick Team Rocket into buying Magikarp in various guises. (This man also appears in Pokémon Red, Blue, Yellow, FireRed, and LeafGreen.) Team Rocket later adopted a Magikarp-shaped submarine.
Magikarp also appear many times in the video games. They can be found in almost any pond, river, lake, or sea. Many trainers have them, along with other weak Water Pokémon like Goldeen or Horsea. In Pokémon Pearl, one trainer named "Ander," found outside Lake Valor, possesses a Magikarp whose move "Quake" replaces the normal Magikarp`s equally useless "Splash".</description>

Rampages like this have been known to last upwards of an entire month, and will not end until everything around them has been destroyed. Because they have been known to sink ships as well through the seastorms their rage causes, they are considered legendary among sailors, especially the red/ golden variety. Its big change in behavior is said to be attributed to a structural change occurring in its brain while evolving from Magikarp.
In the beta version of Pokémon Red and Green, Gyarados had the name of Skullkraken.
Shiny Gyarados is a particularly rare variety of Gyarados. While Gyarados are normally blue in color, there are some rare red/ gold scaled Gyarados. Though no more powerful than their more common blue counterparts, red Gyarados are valued for their rarity and individuality. This is caused in Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal and the anime by a radio frequency transmitted by Team Rocket to force the Magikarp to evolve. The red coloration comes from the Magikarp evolving prematurely, and not undergoing the conversion from red to blue scale pigment. Thus, they retain the same color they had as a Magikarp. Red Gyarados are more commonly called Shiny Gyarados, or even Golden Gyarados due to the contrasting coloration.
In Generation II Pokémon games, a red Gyarados at the Lake of Rage is a main part of the plot. After its defeat or capture, a Red Scale is obtained, which can be given to Mr. Pokémon, or Marcus Spanier, in exchange for an Exp. Share. The red Gyarados is the only Pokémon in the Generation II games that will be shiny without fail.
In the anime, one is owned by Misty. At first, she fearfully dislikes Gyarados due to a traumatic experience, but manages to get over the fear, take over the Cerulean City Gym, and add one to her team. The red Gyarados in the anime is caught by Lance, the dragon trainer, to rescue it from Team Rocket. Team Rocket also uses a Gyarados-shaped submarine in early episodes, but trades it for a Magikarp-shaped submarine in later episodes.
Gyarados was noticeably larger in the Indigo Series, but has since become a lot smaller. Gyarados` most powerful attack is said to be Dragon Rage (however, this is not true in the games, given that Dragon Rage only ever does 40 damage), where many other Gyarados appear around the main Gyarados, then they start spinning around at such a speed they became one huge tornado, as seen in Episode #18: Island of The Giant Pokémon.</description>

<description>Lapras is a dual-type Water/Ice Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, it has a Gigantamax form.
Lapras is a large sea Pokémon that resembles a plesiosaur. It has a blue hide with darker blue spots and a cream-colored underside. It has large brown eyes, a short horn on its forehead, and tightly curled ears. It has a long neck and four flippers. The foremost flippers are larger than the hind. On its back is a heavy, gray shell covered in blunt knobs.
Lapras is a gentle, helpful Pokémon that enjoys ferrying people across bodies of water. In the past, its docility made it an easy target for hunters, and it was driven to near-extinction. Recent protection efforts have seen Lapras become overabundant instead, which is now affecting the fish Pokémon numbers in some areas. An intelligent Pokémon, it is able to understand human speech. Lapras have been known to travel in large pods across the seas, spanning both polar and tropical areas. To keep in touch with other of its kind, it sings enchanting melodies. In the anime it was shown that Lapras is able to develop psychic abilities such as telepathy.
As Gigantamax Lapras, it becomes larger in size and more armored. Its shell resembles a cruise ship with four gray and red stripes surrounding it, and it has four spikes on top of its shell with one steel spike resembling a funnel, which has three red clouds surrounding it. The sclera in Lapras` eyes change colors to white, yellow, and blue. A light blue ring of fine thin lines resembling a musical sheet created from ice particles circles around its shell.
5,000 people can ride on the shell of Gigantamax Lapras for a very comfortable ride without any issues. Lapras can use it giant ring to break any icebergs that may prevent it from swimming.
Gigantamax Lapras is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Resonance.</description>

<description>Eevee is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves into one of eight different Pokémon through various methods. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Eevee is the game mascot and starter Pokémon in Pokémon: Let`s Go, Eevee!, as well as for the main characters of Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness and Pokémon Conquest. It is also the rival`s starter Pokémon in Pokémon Yellow, although Professor Oak originally intended to give it to the player.
Eevee is a mammalian, quadruped Pokémon with primarily brown fur. The tip of its bushy tail and its large furry collar are cream-colored. It has short, slender legs with three small toes and a pink paw pad on each foot. Eevee has brown eyes, long pointed ears with dark brown interiors, and a small black nose. Eevee is rarely found in the wild and is mostly only found in cities and towns. However, Eevee is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure that is easily influenced by its environment. This allows it to adapt to a variety of habitats by evolving. Eevee is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Extreme Evoboost.
In Pokémon: Let`s Go, Eevee!, the player starts with a special Eevee known as a Partner Eevee. The Partner Eevee has purple eyes and a lighter shade of fur. These design elements likely taken from the anime, which implemented similar traits starting in the Advanced Generation series. The marking on the tip of a female Partner Eevee is heart-shaped. Before Pokémon Sword and Shield, this trait was unique and wasn`t found on other female Eevee. Partner Eevee has higher base stats and access to moves that normal Eevee do not. Partner Eevee is the only Pokémon capable of performing Bouncy Bubble, Buzzy Buzz, Sizzly Slide, Glitzy Glow, Baddy Bad, Sappy Seed, Freezy Frost, Sparkly Swirl, and the Partner Power, Veevee Volley. In Pokémon Sword and Shield, the unique pattern is present on all female Eevee as a true gender difference.
As Gigantamax Eevee, it has become larger and more fluffy. The fur collar becomes longer with several triangular furs pointing straight up. The right ear has three red clouds surrounding it like a circle. Due to the fur becoming fluffier and luxurious, any enemies caught in it will lose the will to fight due to being enamored by its presence. Due to Gigantamaxing, Eevee becomes even more playful and rambunctious, desiring to play with its opponent and often unintentionally crushing them with its size.

<description>Vaporeon is one of the evolutions of Eevee that is caused by radiation from a water stone. Upon evolving, it gains fins and gills that give it the ability to live underwater. It has small scales that are hard to see. Its finned tail is similar to a mermaid`s, so it is often mistaken for one. Vaporeon`s cells are similar in structure to water molecules, and this allows it to have a unique control over the water around it. This includes being able to transform itself into liquid as a form of camouflage (this being portrayed in the games as its ability to learn the attack Acid Armor), and detect rain through subtle vibrations in its fins. Its base scale color is aqua with darker aqua that makes a line along the spine from the tail to the neck where it forms into a base for its white frill. A darker-aqua patch on the head is similar in shape to a diving cap, and upon the head are three yellow fins, two resembling ears, and the middle one, a Dorsal fin. Its ability is `Water Absorb`, which allows it to gain HP when struck with a water type move.</description>

<description>Jolteon is one of the evolutions of Eevee that is caused by radiation from a thunder stone. Jolteon is covered with spiky, bright yellow fur, with white spiky fur surrounding its neck. Its fur sparks with electricity constantly; it can be soft to the touch or turn into sharp needles that can be fired when it is angered. Jolteon is able to gather negative ions from the atmosphere, using the resulting electricity to create lightning bolts of up to 10,000 volts. Its individual cells also create small electrical charges on their own, which combined with the static electricity caused by its body can result in powerful electric-type attacks. It`s very sensitive which causes it to constantly charge as it quickly changes moods. It can also make lightning and cause small thunderstorms. In the Pokémon video games, Jolteon can absorb electric attacks and turn them into HP (Health Point, or Health) with the ability `Volt Absorb`.</description>

Its ears are as long as the Jolteon`s. It stores thermal energy from the sun, causing its body temperature to skyrocket to more than a range of 1600 degrees Celsius, releasing its flames from an internal sack. Its ability is `Flash Fire` which negates fire-type moves against it and increases its attack by 1.5 times damage if hit by a damaging fire attack.</description>

While concealed, Kabuto leaves exposed only its hard shell, which protects it from any attacks, while the glowing eyes on its back allow it to continue monitoring its surroundings. If it is flipped upside down, it becomes helpless and defenseless as it is unable to flip over on its own. According to the anime, oil extracted from a Kabuto is rumored to have interesting medical properties, longevity being one of them.</description>

It is imagined to have been the king of the skies in ancient times, with a body structure similar to a pterodactyl and other features, such as the head and tail, having more in common with dragons. It captures its prey with its talons and brings it to its nest. However, if the prey resists, it may use its razor-sharp teeth to immobilize it. When attacking its enemies or opponents, it goes for the throat with its saw like fangs. Aerodactyl is heavy and rough-skinned, leading to the development of strong wings.</description>

<description>Snorlax is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Munchlax when leveled up with high friendship. It also has a Gigantamax form.
In the Generation I and II games and their remakes, wild Snorlax can be found sleeping in inconvenient locations throughout Kanto. In order to catch one, a Trainer must first awaken it with music from either a Poké Flute or Pokégear set to the Poké Flute channel. A sleeping Snorlax makes a return in Pokémon X and Y, in which it is blocking the player`s way on Route 7.
Snorlax is a huge, bipedal, dark blue-green Pokémon with a cream-colored face, belly, and feet. Its body is composed of mostly its belly, as its limbs are comparatively small. Its head is large with small, pointed ears and two pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw. It has round feet, which both have three claws and a circular brown paw pad, and short arms with five claws on each hand. Snorlax`s bulk makes it the heaviest Normal type.
Snorlax is often found in mountains and forests. It wakes up only to eat, requiring 900 lbs. (400 kg) of food per day before returning to its slumber. It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it to eat even moldy food without feeling any ill effects. It can even handle thorny plants or Muk`s poison. It can also eat while it is resting. Snorlax is docile enough to let children and small Pokémon bounce on its large stomach.
Snorlax can show awesome power when prompted. As Gigantamax Snorlax, seeds and small rocks that were tangled in its belly fur goes through immense growth and a tree spouts upon its belly. The tree has three red clouds surrounding it like a circle. It almost never moves; even when in battle it only slightly lifts its body and attacks by flailing with its arms and legs. However, its attacks are very powerful — Gigantamax Snorlax is considered to be the strongest Dynamax Pokémon to have been discovered.
It is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Pulverizing Pancake and G-Max Move G-Max Replenish.</description>

<description>Articuno is one of the three Legendary Birds along with Zapdos and Moltres. It is a large bird with blue plumage, a bluish-white-feathered chest, a three feathered crest adorning its nose, and a long, sparkling tail. It can create and manipulate ice freely. Its translucent wings are imbued with the essence of frigidity, and the flapping of its wings chills the air, causing the conversion of water particles in the air into snow or ice, causing snow to fall when it flies overhead. In legend, Articuno resides within the confines of icy mountains, because those who have seen its were often doomed explorers scaling such mountains, and therefore it is believed Articuno makes it a point to appear before them and save them.
It is interesting to note that the last letters of its name, "uno" ("one" in Spanish), suggest it is the first of the three legendary bird Pokémon. This is reinforced by the fact that the last letters of the names of its fellow legendary birds suggest that they are the second and third. They are Zapdos ("dos", which is "two" in Spanish) and Moltres ("tres", which is "three" in Spanish).
Articuno`s video game appearances occur in the very confusing mazes of the icy Seafoam Islands, on Route 20, between Fuschia City and Cinnabar Island. It is a unique Pokémon that usually appears alongside Zapdos and Moltres. Since only one of each exists in the games, players usually try to catch the Birds.
Articuno also makes appearances in the anime and manga, also as a unique Pokémon and a general species. They participate in various events and battles. Articuno was initially believed to be the large golden bird Ash saw in the very first episode, but it turned out to actually be Ho-Oh, though the earlier reference was kept in the Red, Blue, Yellow game versions when one looked into a telescope and saw it. Its largest role is in Pokémon: The Movie 2000. Lawrence III creates a battle between the three birds, and Ash Ketchum had to team up with Lugia to stop them. In the beginning of the Battle Frontier challenge in the anime, Noland, the battle factory frontier brain had befriended one. After reuniting with their photographer friend Todd, Ash and its friends hear a rumor that Articuno lives on a certain mountain. After several encounters with Team Rocket, Ash and Todd are saved by Articuno from a snowstorm, and Todd manages to snap a picture of it. Ash`s Charizard did battle with it and Articuno lost by a narrow margin.
In Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, Articuno is the third legendary boss as well as the third legendary bird you battle. He is also the hardest to convince of the three legendary birds that the main hero Pokémon is not responsible for the havocs in the Pokémon World. Absol prevents Articuno from ending the hero and partner by ensuring that Articuno knows the truth.</description>

<description>Zapdos is one of the three Legendary Birds along with Articuno and Moltres. It may be based on the thunderbird. It is a bird with a yellow, angular body and wings. Also behind its main yellow wings is a second pair of thinner, jet-black wings. Its beak is long and extremely sharp. Zapdos, a creature that can freely manipulate electricity, is thought to live in thunderclouds, where it apparently only gains power when struck by lightning. It is seen emerging from clouds while dropping enormous lightning bolts, and even if it does not launch electricity its wings make peculiar crackling and snapping sounds as it flies.
It is interesting to note that the last letters of its name, "dos" ("two" in Spanish), suggest it is the second of the three legendary bird Pokémon. This is reinforced by the fact that the last letters of the names of its fellow legendary birds suggest that they are the first and third. They are Articuno ("uno", which is "one" in Spanish) and Moltres ("tres", which is "three" in Spanish).
Zapdos is found in a Power Plant off the coast of the Rock Tunnel near Cerulean City in Pokémon Red and Blue, and related games. It also plays small roles in the anime and manga. Zapdos is featured in Pokémon The Movie 2000 together with the other two Legendary birds, Articuno and Moltres. It appears that Zapdos communicates through electricity as it shocks Pikachu to communicate. Zapdos also appeared in the 9th Pokémon Movie.</description>

<description>Moltres is one of the three Legendary Birds, along with Articuno and Zapdos. It is a large bird that is literally ablaze with fire, resembling something related to a phoenix. It has an orange body, a small pointed beak, and where its plumage should be are flames of a searing intensity. It can freely create and manipulate fire, and it constantly looses flaming embers from its wings. When its body is injured for any reason, it will head towards a volcano and dip its body in the molten magma to heal its wounds. Moltres is an elusive creature, seen about as rarely as the other two members of the Legendary Bird triad. When Moltres thinks it is in the least bit possible danger, it will summon a flash of fire and seemingly disappear, flying out of sight very fast.
The first video game appearance of Moltres was in Pokémon Red and Blue versions. In these Versions, Moltres was in a blocked off area of Victory Road, only accessible from the end of the cave. However, Moltres was moved from its lair in FireRed and LeafGreen, to Mount Ember, an active volcano, on 1 Island, the first of the new Sevii Islands.
The first official appearance of Moltres in the anime was in the episode that marks the beginning of the Pokémon League, where it lights the torch which is equivalent to the real-life Olympic Torch. It also plays a role in "Pokémon The Movie 2000: The Power of One", along with the other two Legendary Birds (Zapdos and Articuno). It was one of the two birds that the villainous collector, often referred to as both Gelardan and Lawrence III, captured to allow him access to Lugia`s power, but the upset of the balance that occurred as a result nearly caused a worldwide weather catastrophe as Moltres was driven to wage war with its two rivals. They were quelled once Ash and Lugia fulfilled the prophecy related to the legendary birds. In a later episode of Pokémon Chronicles, Ash`s rival Richie encountered a trainer named Silver who wanted to capture Moltres, battling him with its Salamence. Silver is interrupted by Team Rocket members Butch and Cassidy who attempt to kidnap Moltres, rather than catching him fairly. Richie and Silver team up to defeat Butch and Cassidy and rescue Moltres, although the firebird was badly weakened by the Rockets` attack. Silver let Moltres go, wanting to catch him in a fair fight when it was at full strength, although it promised it`d try again.
According to one of the trainers in Blaine`s gym on Cinnabar Island, Blaine decided to become a trainer of Fire-type Pokémon after having been rescued by a fiery bird when lost in the mountains.</description>

<description>Dratini is a serpent-like dragon Pokémon with a white circle shape on its forehead. It has two developing wings at the sides of its head, which grow to be enormous as it evolves. Dratini are born small, and as they shed their skin, they grow larger. They have a massive amount of energy rapidly increasing inside of their bodies, hence, they have great strength which grows exponentially as they evolve. They were thought to be purely mythical creatures, but they were discovered to be real by a fisherman. They live in colonies in the ocean in limited numbers and fetch a high price as Pokémon to be used for battling. They can only be obtained by the most determined and skilled trainers, as demonstrated on various episodes of the original Pokémon series.
The episode in which Dratini first appeared ("The Legend of Dratini") has never been seen on American television, due to use of guns and humor considered "politically incorrect" to American audiences (Meowth dressed as Adolf Hitler, Jessie seducing a guard by dressing up as a schoolgirl).</description>

<description>Dragonite is the final form of the Dratini evolutionary line. It evolves from Dragonair at level 55. Dragonite`s appearance is notably different from that of its previous forms. As Dragonite, it is now a golden bipedal dragon with a beige underbelly that extends from the top of its neck to the tip of its tail. Along with already being a Dragon-type, it has now gained the secondary Flying-type, growing wings. Dragonite is one of the fastest flying Pokémon, and "The fastest flying Pokémon" as of the first generation. It has a small horn on the top of its head, along with slightly "S" shaped antennae. However, much like its previous forms, Dragonite still has a gentle and somewhat innocent appearance. Its diet consists mainly of berries, soft plants, and fruit, while it will occasionally eat crustaceans, like Corphish and Krabby.
Dragonite are very loyal to any trainer they find worthy of acceptance. They are calm, gentle, and intelligent creatures, but when threatened can put their pudgy bulk to good use. Dragonite seem to have more advanced vocal abilities compared to other Pokémon in that they make several different types of calls, rather than just saying their name. They have been noted to save drowning swimmers and threatened sailors. Dragonites` speed is very varied; some Dragonite can have great speeds while other have very low/average speeds. It is said that Dragonite can circle the globe in less than 16 hours.
Dragonite`s main anime appearance was at the end of the Orange Island League season in "Enter The Dragonite". It was spotted twice in the previous episode "Hello Pummelo" as Ash, Tracy and Misty saw it flying over the sea around Pummelo Island and they learned that it was owned by the "Orange Crew" leader, Drake. It also defeated Team Rocket as they tried to steal Dragonite. In Ash`s six on six battle with Drake, it defeated Ash`s Charizard with Dragon Rage, Squirtle with Thunder and Tauros with Thunder before Ash`s Pikachu took it out with a Thunder of its own. While none of Ash`s Pokémon were strong enough to defeat Dragonite on their own, their combined attacks steadily weakened it to the point of exhaustion, allowing Pikachu to finally defeat it. Drake keeps Dragonite`s Poké Ball on a necklace. Professor Oak also owns a Dragonite and was used prior to the episode "The Mastermind of Mirage Pokémon". It also appeared in Pokémon: The First Movie, when it was sent by Mewtwo to give Ash and his friends an invitation. It also appeared in the beginning of Ash`s journey when he encountered Bill. Here, Dragonite was described as an unknown legendary Pokémon by the Pokédex, and because it was nighttime the colour of its skin couldn`t be seen.</description>

<description>Sentret is a very cautious Pokémon, it raises itself up onto its tail to get a better view of its surroundings. While standing on its tail, it can see a long way. If it spots an enemy, it will cry out loudly to warn its kind. It will also hit the ground with its tail. A Sentret will only sleep when another one is standing guard. The Sentret will wake the others at the first sign of danger. Because of this, if one is separated from its pack, then it will be unable to sleep due to fear.

<description>Furret live in colonies with tunnels much too small for normal Pokemon to traverse, yet it is a perfect fit for the slim build of Furret as it hides from the outside world at the surface by traversing through these tunnels like gophers. These tunnel colonies become very complex, especially if they are very deep, and can potentially stretch for miles. Occasionally, these colonies are found intertwined with Diglett colonies. The Furret evolves from Sentret at level 15.
Furret`s rudimentary paws and legs are deceptively nimble, making Furret a quick, unpredictable predator especially skillful at hunting Rattata, its main prey. Also, the fur of the Pokemon is thicker than it appears, and Furret can fluff up its fur to make itself look much stronger and larger than it actually is as an intimidation tactic towards potential foes.
Furret is based on a ferret or squirrel.</description>

A Ledyba communicates with others through an aromatic fluid excreted from the points where its legs meet its thorax.

<description>Ariados is the evolution of Spinarak. Ariados is able to spin silk out of both its mouth and rear, which is advantageous against unsuspecting foes. It captures prey by spinning its strong silk around the prey, rendering it helpless to be devoured or carried back to the nest. Ariados` feet end in hooks that allow it to grip well enough to walk on vertical surfaces and on horizontal surfaces upside-down. Ariados uses its nest as a base of sorts. A strand of silk is constantly spun from its rear that leads back to its nest. This allows it to wander in search of food, which it usually does at night. This is in contrast to its unevolved form, Spinarak, which instead waits patiently for its prey to come to its web.</description>

<description>Crobat is the evolution of Golbat as of the Gold and Silver editions of the game. It`s a purple bat with four wings, with two main wings above and two secondary wings below. The development of these lower wings to replace its legs, as a result of its pursuit of faster, yet more silent flight, enables it to fly fast and silently indeed, but also makes it tough to stop and rest. Its extra wings will even allow it to fly long distances by alternating which set of wings it uses when it tires. The only way it can rest is to hang on a tree branch using its lower legs to grab onto it the way normal bats would. It flies so silently through the dark on its four wings that it may not be noticed even when nearby. It uses this to its advantage when hunting prey.
The appearances of Crobat in the anime have been largely of Brock`s Crobat. Brock caught a Zubat very early on in the original series, and it evolved into a Golbat, and then a Crobat.</description>

<description>Chinchou has a small blue body and two antennae sprouting from its head, both of which have a yellow globe at the end. These antennae are said to have evolved from fins. A Chinchou`s eyes are yellow and their pupils have the shape of plus signs. When blinking or closing its eyes, only the vertical parts close, making the pupils look like minus signs. Its habitat is the dark depths of the ocean floor. In the absence of any other light, Chinchou sees its surroundings and communicates by shooting positive and negative charged electricity particles between the tips of its antennae, creating an electric current and thus light. This can be said to be a form of bioluminescence. The charges Chinchou shoots between its antennae can also be used offensively, to stun its opponents with a flash of light or shock them with electricity.</description>

<description>Lanturn uses the bright part of its body, which gradually evolved from a dorsal fin, to lure prey. Given the nickname "deep-sea star", the light it emits is so bright that it can illuminate the sea`s surface from a depth of over 3 miles. It uses this light to attract and blind prey, and then swallow the immobilized prey in a single gulp. The light is also useful for Lanturn to navigate through the deep, murky waters. The light from its antenna is produced by bacterial symbiosis. Bioluminescent bacteria in Lanturn`s antenna cause a chemical reaction with Lanturn`s bodily fluids to create the bright light.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Pichu, known as the "Tiny Mouse" species of Pokémon, are the pre-evolved version of Pikachu. They stand at 1`00" and weight 4.4 lbs. Their cheeks are pink, and they have small, plump bodies with short, jagged tails, and large ears. They are not skilled at storing electricity, so when amused or startled, they often discharge jolts of electricity strong enough to affect adult humans. This lack of control becomes more stable as they grow older. The electricity that they do manage to keep stored is limited by their small electrical pouches in their cheeks. When the air is dry or on stormy days, they charge much more easily, leaving the sound of crackling static electricity emanating from them. They play with each other by touching tails to set off sparks, which also acts as a test of courage. They run the risk of shorting each other out, and scaring themselves into a crying fit with the flash of sparks that emanates from them. In the anime, it is said that a Pichu cannot use electric attacks without hurting itself. This is a feature not prominently featured in the games.
Pichu first appeared in Pokémon Gold and Silver, and is one of many pre-evolutions introduced into the series. At one point, a Nintendo GameCube game called Pichu Bros: Party Panic was in development but never released, featuring Pichu as the main character. Instead, the game was integrated into Pokémon Channel as an important part of the story-line.</description>

<description>Mareep are blue skinned sheep or lamb-like creatures which have long, striped tails with a yellow ball at the tip. Their fleece is yellow, while their bodies are a dark blue color. Their ears are a rounded cone shape and channel the electricity that they keep in their fleece. Mareep are said to build up a stockpile of static electricity by rubbing the fluffy woolen fleece on their body, with that of other Mareep. The electricity is then stored in their fleece, and will shock predators on contact. The more electricity that is stored, the brighter the ball on the tip of a Mareep`s tail is thought to glow. In summer, the fleece is fully shed, but would grow back within a week. Mareep also are thought to store air in the fleece, enabling it to control its body temperature whatever the weather.</description>

It has black stripes on its ears and its long tail, and it has small, beady eyes that look like black dots. It has a blue ball on the tip of its tail. Flaaffy usually likes to sit upright, although it can stand on two legs if necessary. Its wool quality changes as it matures so that it can generate a high amount of strong static electricity while still having a small amount of wool. Its bare, electric-resistant, parts of its hides enable it to prevent electrocution. As a result of storing too much, it develops patches even where wool won`t grow.</description>

Ampharos has powerful light abilities, its main light sources being the large orbs on its tail and head, and because of this is often used as a beacon in lighthouses, and mythical legend says that these lights can even be seen from outer space. Before the introduction of modern technology, Ampharos` light was used to communicate between long distances, in much a similar way to smoke signals.</description>

<description>Bellossom is a diurnal plant Pokémon. It evolves from Gloom if exposed to a Sun Stone. Bellossom`s petals can rotate, and they usually do when it is absorbing sunlight. The color of their leaves vary from a sickly brown and gray to a fluorescent yellow and red, depending on how much sunlight it has absorbed in the past few hours. When its petals are moving, either due to rotating or dancing, they rub together to make relaxing, bell-like sounds. The petals on its head also create a sweet scent.
It is also noted that a Bellossom will be even more beautiful if it was an especially rancid Gloom. The worse it smells as a Gloom, the prettier its petals will be as a Bellossom. Although naturally a peaceful and friendly Pokémon, it can be very territorial and violent fights can break out if there is an intruder or a challenger. Despite this, it is very social in areas outside of its self-determined territory, and the most common time to find a group of Bellossom together is when they all meet in one location to dance. It is said that these dances summon the sun.
Its Japanese name, "Kireihana", translates to "Beautiful" (kirei) and "Flower" (hana).</description>

<description>Marill is an aquatic mouse Pokémon. Marill`s tail floats like a buoy because it is filled with oil, which is less dense than water. When fishing at a fast-running stream, Marill wraps its tail around a tree. Since the tail is stretchy and flexible, it allows the Pokémon to get food and still stay safely anchored. Otherwise, when in a lake, it uses the buoy-qualities of its tail to keep itself suspended as the rest of its body dives underwater to feed on aquatic plants. Its fur is impermeable, which keeps it dry, and that allows it to swim through water at high speed without being slowed by the water`s resistance.
In the Pokémon Anime, Tracey, the Pokémon Observer from the Orange Islands, has a Marill which he uses on multiple occasions.</description>

<description>Azumarill is the evolved form of Marill. Azumarill resembles a blue, bipedal rabbit with a large, ellipsoid body, long blue ears with red insides, and a blue ball on the end of its thin, elastic black tail. The white bubble-like pattern on its lower stomach helps it to camouflage itself from potential predators when it is in the water.
Azumarill`s long ears act as sensors to identify sounds even in fast running rivers. Otherwise, when alone, Azumarill plays in water as a natural pastime, though it must roll up its elongated ears to prevent the sensitive sensory materials inside them from getting wet. The ball at the end of its tail can act as a sensor and guide it while under water. It can make thick, liquid balloons out of thin air with the saliva-water stored in its body. If it spots a drowning Pokémon in any body of water, it fashions such air balloons and jumps in to give the troubled Pokémon air balloons to help it breathe.
In the Pokémon anime, Paul owned an Azumarill which he used in a gym battle against Roark. Although it knew powerful Water attacks like Hydro Pump, it lost to Roark`s Geodude, which prompted Paul to give it to a Pokémon trainer passing by, being disappointed by its strength.</description>

<description>Sudowoodo is a bending, bipedal creature vaguely in the shape of a tree trunk. It has a double-pronged protuberance on its head, tiny feet, a simple face, and a pair of three-fingered hands where the fingers are green spheres resembling leaves on a tree. Although Sudowoodo pretends to be a tree, its body is made not out of wood, but rock. It uses this as a form of camouflage, hiding among forest areas to avoid being attacked by enemies. Additionally, its signature technique is Mimic, which allows it to copy enemy attacks. It earns its classification as the imitation Pokémon through these practices.
In the winter seasons, when trees are either white with snow or have had their leaves fall off from autumn, Sudowoodo is easy to spot as a fake because its hands remain green, making winter a more dangerous time for Sudowoodo to be in the presence of foes. Also, as a creature whose composition resembles rock, Sudowoodo hates water, so it will disappear and seek shelter when rainfall begins. In the video games, it often blocks areas until sprayed with water, which causes it to battle. In Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, the twig-shaped appendage atop a Sudowoodo`s head is larger on a male than it is on a female. The origin of its name is: Pseudo (False) + Wood.</description>

<description>Politoed, a frog Pokémon, is an alternate evolution of Poliwhirl that is obtained by trading it to another player with a King`s Rock. Politoed has green skin which turns yellow at its paws, lower jaw and belly. Its belly is adorned with a green spiral mark, similar to its pre-evolutionary forms. On top of its head grows a long blue hair that is curled in a manner similar to the spiral. Politoed dominates over its related species. When Poliwags and Poliwhirls hear its cry, they come running to its side from far and wide. Its status is displayed in the form of its single blue curly hair, which is an object of reverence among its "subjects." The longer and more curled the hair, the better respected the Politoed who supports it.
In the anime, Politoed is one of the Pokémon used by Misty. She obtained it when her Poliwhirl was withdrawn in its Poké Ball while holding the King`s Rock Ash had previously won as a Pokémon sumo tournament prize. Misty`s Politoed is strong and cheerful. It is frequently seen joyfully dancing around.</description>

<description>Hoppip are small, spherical creatures, with long leaves protruding from their head. They have small, gripping feet and ears disproportionate to their body, used to listen for winds. Hoppip have extremely petite and almost weightless bodies, and are susceptible to strong winds due to this. When a Hoppip feels a gale approaching, it will lock the leaves on its head with the leaves of other Hoppip, in an attempt to avoid being blown away. If a Hoppip is by itself when in heavy winds, it may grip the ground with its feet to prevent this. Despite the dangers Hoppip face in strong winds, they enjoy gentle breezes and can float in the calmest of winds, which can carry them across vast distances.</description>

This allows Skiploom to be used as a thermometer. It is capable of floating in the air, a skill it uses to get closer to the sun in order to better absorb the sunlight. When the sunlight is strong, its ability, Chlorophyll, increases its speed. When it rains, the flower instantly closes and Skiploom hides under a tree to avoid getting wet.</description>

They are very adept at catching the warm southern winds and navigating their way to any location in the world, typically overseas and until they encounter a cold air current, whereupon they will begin landing. While floating, Jumpluff release spores that propagate its offspring around the world. This method of reproduction is reminiscent of dandelions.</description>

<description>Aipom resembles a purple squirrel monkey with its face forever frozen in a maniacal grin that can be described as rictus and a blank stare from its round eyes. On its thin tail is a three fingered hand-like appendage that is very dexterous. It provides both propulsion and balance while Aipom leaps from tree to tree. Aipom is not aggressive by nature and will attempt to tire its natural opponents through dexterous dodging of the opponent`s attacks in hope that the enemy will be discouraged and leave. Otherwise, if the enemy is persistent, the Aipom will try to retreat, but if it is unable to, it will attack by diving at its opponent from the trees.
In the anime, an Aipom steals Ash`s hat, and follows his group around until Ash battles and captures it. Ash`s Aipom is quite attached to him, getting incredibly jealous when it sees Pikachu on Ash`s shoulder. Aipom has the distinction of being the only Pokemon aside from Pikachu that Ash brought with him to Sinnoh, although inadvertently. Aipom seems to enjoy contests, and Dawn believes it prefers contests over battles. In "Throwing the Track Switch!", Ash trades Aipom for Dawn`s Buizel because both Pokemon seemed more interested in the other trainer`s training. In "Journey to the Unknown", Dawn`s Aipom evolves into Ambipom.</description>

<description>Sunflora is the evolved form of Sunkern. Sunflora is a diurnal sunflower Pokémon; unlike its unevolved form Sunkern, it is wholly inactive at night. However, it is very active and playful during the day when the sun is bright. Like Bellossom, it evolves using a Sun Stone. Sunflora prefer hot climates; their foliage becomes more colorful and elaborate as the temperature rises. Sunflora unfurl their petals and absorb sunlight for energy. It is possible for a Sunflora to absorb too much sunlight, though. When this happens, its head and petals become engorged and very heavy, which is dangerous for a Sunflora, since it can wilt and possibly get sick. At night, the petals are furled, covering Sunflora`s face.
A Sunflora is constantly soaking up sunlight and moving around in a blissful fashion. In preparation for winter, Sunflora will migrate to warmer and sunnier areas, so as not to lose the vital source of their energy. Sunflora like to live in flower patches. They do their best to stay hidden among the other flowers, but usually they are very noticeable.</description>

Quagsire always bear an absent-looking facial expression. This is likely due to Quagsire`s easy-going nature. It hunts by staying still in the water with its mouth open, waiting for small prey to swim into its mouth. It doesn`t move, and therefore, doesn`t get hungry. It`s not uncommon that a fishermen`s hook will get caught in the gaping mouth of a feeding Quagsire. Trying to eat what it has caught, the Quagsire would try to swallow, and end up pulling the fishermen off his boat and into the water. Male Quagsire have larger fins on their backs. They wait at the bottom of lakes waiting for prey to wander into its mouth. It also loves eating cherries.</description>

The appearance of Espeon is said to resemble the Japanese mythological creature known as Nekomata which also displays the feline body with forked tail tip and solid colored eyes. An Espeon`s fur is used to sense air currents, allowing it to predict the weather, as well as the actions of its opponent in battle. Its forked tail quivers when this occurs. A red jewel rests on its head, and glows whenever Espeon uses its psychic abilities. Espeon are described as being very loyal to their trainers once they consider them worthy. They are also said to develop precognitive abilities in order to protect their trainers, Espeon become enabled to see into the future to identify potential threats. Eevee evolves into Espeon by having a high happiness level and leveling up during the day. A Sun Shard item can also be used in Pokémon XD, a Sun Ribbon in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue, Red, Explorers of Time, and Explorers of Darkness. Espeon`s name is derived from "ESP" and the suffix "-eon", as with every evolution of Eevee.</description>

<description>Umbreon is one of two Eevee evolutions that first featured in Pokémon Gold and Silver, the other being Espeon. It is called the "Moonlight" Pokémon. It has rabbit-like features displayed strongly in the shape of its head and eyes, a reference to the Japanese idea that you can see the head of a rabbit on the face of the moon. One of Umbreon`s most noticeable features is the yellow rings visible around its body. The Pokédex states that the rings will glow when Umbreon leaps to attack, becomes excited, or when there is a full moon. Umbreon are said to evolve as a result of love for their trainers and the moonlight; forcing one to walk during the day can also cause stress to it. They are described as preferring to lurk in darkness while waiting for their opponents to make the first move. If angered, they can secrete powerful poisonous sweat from their pores.</description>

<description>Wobbuffet is a stiff, blue, balloon-shaped Pokémon based on the late Japanese comedian Sanpei Hayashiya (林家三平) (1925-1980). Hayashiya`s trademark routine involved him putting one hand to his forehead and saying "Sou nansu, okusan" (そうなんす, 奥さん) ("So it seems, madam"). This is why, in the Japanese Pokémon anime and movies, Wobbuffet is often seen putting a hand to its forehead and shouting "Soooooonansu!" (which was translated as well for the English adaptation, where it indeed says "Woooooobbuffet!"). It is voiced by Kayzie Rogers.
Wobbuffet hates light and shock, so it lives in the quiet darkness of caves and only comes out at night. If attacked, it inflates its body to bolster its amazing ability to counter-attack using the moves Counter and Mirror Coat, rather than offensive battling like most other Pokémon, for it won`t attack on its own. It does nothing but endure attacks in this fashion, suggesting that Wobbuffet either has an inability to tolerate aggressive behavior on its part, or that it is simply built to withstand attacks. However, it will not endure an attack on its valued, sensitive tail. When that happens, the Pokémon will try to take the foe with it using Destiny Bond. To keep its pitch-black tail hidden from the sight of potential attackers, it lives in black caves and atmospheres as described above.
In the Pokémon anime, Jessie has owned a Wobbuffet ever since she accidentally exchanged her Lickitung for it in the episode Tricks Of The Trade. Wobbuffet is her equivalent of Misty`s Psyduck — it has a habit of popping out of its Pokéball at inopportune times without being called, including at the end of Team Rocket`s motto.</description>

Dunsparce lives in caves and deep underground in nests of complex design. Its rudimentary wings enable it to hover just above the ground, providing it with an alternate method of motion besides crawling. Despite these wings and bug-like appearance, Dunsparce is solely a normal type Pokémon.</description>

<description>Scizor is a human-size mantis similar to its evolutionary predecessor Scyther, with a thick, metallic red exoskeleton and crab-like claws. It is tougher and stronger than Scyther, but has lost its predecessor`s speed and ability to fly. Instead, it spreads its wings to cool off, and flaps them very rapidly to heat up, or to blow air to cool itself off. Its demeanor changes, as well. While Scyther is a mantis-like predator, striking fast and simply evading potential pursuers, Scizor is more crab-like, with a conservative, defensive demeanor, in keeping with its greater defensive ability and lesser speed. Once it engages its foe, either in the wild or at the direction of a Pokémon Trainer in a Pokémon battle, however, it behaves more like Scyther, striking quickly with its powerful claws, raking more than pinching, and relying on its startling agility to evade attacks.</description>

Growing from its head is a large T-shaped horn, which is flanked on either side by a smaller antenna. Heracross is a powerful but docile Pokémon. Its natural habitat is forests and its diet consists of tree sap, nectar and honey. Its strength is such that it can topple large trees if it so wished. Heracross`s main weapon is its large horn, of which it is particularly proud. However, it only uses it in the wild to deter its foes, not hurt them.
In the Pokémon anime, Ash catches a Heracross in the episode A Sappy Ending. The Heracross is powerful, but also is distracted by sap, to the point where it tries to feed off the nectar of Ash`s Bulbasaur`s flower bulb when Bulbasaur is in sight. It is currently at Professor Oak`s lab.</description>

Once the crescent fully closes into a circle, the Teddiursa is ready to evolve into an Ursaring. Teddiursa, although an omnivore, has a diet that almost exclusively consists of honey. It makes its own honey out of fruit and pollen from Beedrill. It lets the honey soak in its paws, making it often lick its paws.</description>

<description>Ursaring is a large (although arboreal) bear with a yellow ring on its stomach. Ursaring eats food obtained from digging deep underground as well as berries from trees. Ursaring can hibernate through an entire winter without any food. Ursaring`s sense of smell is among the most developed of all Pokémon; it can detect subtle differences in scents. For this reason, Ursaring is sometimes used by police in the Pokémon universe, both as a strong enforcer, and as an explosive-sniffing Pokémon. If criminals are hiding in trees, it can use its claws to cut down the tree.
Its Japanese name, "Ringuma", originates from "ring" (ringu) and "bear" (kuma). In the anime, Ursaring is caught by Paul, after it is angered by Turtwig.</description>

<description>Swinub is a pig covered in brown fur with dark brown stripes, and is found in icy areas. It roots around with its nose to find food, its favorite being a certain mushroom that grows under dead grass. Swinub`s nose is so tough that even the frozen ground poses no problem. Occasionally, it will find hot springs while rooting around in the ground. In the anime, Dawn acquires a Swinub she met in Mr. Backlot`s garden, after it saved her and the group`s Pokémon from Team Rocket.</description>

<description>Corsola is a dual-type Water/Rock Pokémon introduced in Generation II.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
In Galar, Corsola has a Ghost-type regional form. It evolves into Cursola starting at level 38.
Corsola is a small, pink, roundish Pokémon with branch-like growths on its back, which are similar to coral. There is a smaller, blunt horn on its forehead, and it has black, oval eyes. It has a white underside, which speckles towards the sides. Its four legs and two arms are blunt and stubby.
Found in the warm shallow waters of southern seas, Corsola requires clean water to live. If its habitat is dirty, the growths on its back become discolored and degenerate. However, when it is healthy, its growths regularly shed and grow back. It is able to regrow them over the course of a single night. It forms large social groups. Occasionally, these groups get so large that people may live atop them, as is the case in Pacifidlog Town. Corsola`s horn is a prized material, commonly used for jewelry and carving as seen in the anime. Smaller Pokémon like Seadra and Luvdisc are sometimes sheltered by Corsola`s branches, and even offer it protection from foes.
Galarian Corsola were wiped out by sudden changes in ocean temperature caused by a meteor impact, turning them into Ghost-types. Its body is a bleached white with half-closed pink eyes and a perpetual frown, and its arms and branches have a distinctly semitransparent appearance to them; the branches can be used to take root inside and drain the life force of others.
The branches cannot cause injures or pain, but they immobilize the victim until Galarian Corsola lets them go. They are commonly found in the remains of prehistoric seas, and while they can be mistaken for ordinary rocks, they will curse anybody who kicks them by accident.
In the Alola region, Mareanie and Toxapex are natural predators of Corsola. However, they do not fulfill those roles in the Galar region, having not realized the branches of Corsola are delicious.</description>

<description>Remoraid is a Remora-based suckerfish that scavenges for food and has a somewhat symbiotic relationship with Mantine. Remoraid will attach itself to the underbelly of Mantine with its dorsal fin, eating scraps of food that Mantine drops as well as the parasites on them that causes them to itch. In return, the Mantine helps defend the Remoraid from enemies. When not scavenging for food, Remoraid will strike down its own prey with precise accuracy using fast streams of airborne water, which Remoraid shoots from its mouth using abdominal muscles. Remoraid can move faster through the water by blasting water from its mouth in the opposite direction of where it intends to move.</description>

Also, like octopuses, Octillery can move about by squirting pressurized water from its mouth. Octillery is a carnivore; they catch fish with their tentacles, and kill (and afterwards eat) it by smashing the rocky protrusions on its head into its opponent`s skull. Octillery is a nesting creature, in that it sleeps in burrows it prepares; however, its nests are temporary structures only, and it rarely uses the same nest two nights in a row.</description>

Its large and well-developed wings enable it to briefly leap over the sea`s surface if it builds up enough speed, in a manner similar to some real aquatic species. Mantine is a filter feeder, like whales; its diet consists of most things that happen to enter its mouth while swimming.</description>

Skarmory`s wings become battered from repeated battles, so it grows the feathers back to the original state once a year. Feathers from Skarmory have been used by people of the past as knives and swords. It is based on the Stymphalian birds of Greek mythology.</description>

The tuft is continuously soaked by a special fluid secreted from the tip of the tail. The color of the fluid is predetermined for each Smeargle. The fluid is used to mark the boundaries of its territory and print its footprints on the backs of its fellows once they reach maturity. Over 5,000 distinctive marks left by the species have been found in the Pokémon world.
Smeargle has its "Sketch" technique, which is unique to Smeargle. When used, it will replace itself permanently with the last attack technique used by an opponent Pokémon against Smeargle. It learns Sketch every ten levels. There are a few attacks Sketch cannot copy, (Such as Chatots main attack Chatter) but it can learn nearly every attack in the game.</description>

Before Torchic`s legs develop fully, it stays with their Pokémon trainer, following behind with unsteady, hopping steps while it learns to walk properly. It attacks by spitting 1,800 degree fire formed in a special pouch in its stomach. This pouch constantly heats its body, allowing it to give "warm hugs." It dislikes darkness due to not being able to see its surroundings.
In the anime, May choses a playful Torchic as her starter Pokémon because she considers it to be cute. She often uses it in battles, but avoids using it in Pokémon Contests until it evolves.</description>

<description>Mudkip, known as the "Mud Fish" species of Pokémon, are featured as one of the selectable starter Pokémon in the third generation of the series. They are small blue Pokémon with a large fin on their head that allows them to sense movements within the air and water, acting as a radar. While in the water, they use the orange, spiky gills on their cheeks to breathe while using their large tail fin to propel themselves. They are extremely strong, despite their small bodies; they are able to lift large boulders by planting all four feet and heaving, and easily crush them. When it comes time to sleep, they bury themselves within the soil at the edge of the water. In the anime, Brock obtains a Mudkip at Dewford Island, which later evolves into a Marshtomp.
The phrase "So i herd u liek mudkipz" has become an Internet meme following its initial appearance on the imageboard 4chan. The meme has resulted in a large number of tribute videos on YouTube.</description>

Like Mudkip, it can use the fin on its head to navigate.
In the Pokémon anime, Brock has a Marshtomp that evolved from a Mudkip he caught that is currently at his hometown in Pewter City.</description>

This unquestioning loyalty transfers over to when Mightyena are owned by Pokemon trainers, but the Mightyena will only obey the orders of a trainer it recognizes as possessing superior skill.
Mightyena are naturally quick to attack; they chase down their prey and nip until the target can no longer run. In the event that an individual Mightyena encounters a threatening foe, it gives obvious signals when it is preparing to attack; It starts to growl deeply and then flattens its body before biting savagely.</description>

<description>Zigzagoon is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation III.
It evolves into Linoone starting at level 20.
In Galar, Zigzagoon has a Dark/Normal-type regional form. It evolves into Galarian Linoone starting at level 20, which evolves into Obstagoon when leveled up at night starting at level 35.
Zigzagoon is a raccoon-like, quadruped Pokémon with bristly, zigzag-patterned fur. It has stripes formed by alternating layers of cream and brown fur. It has a brown head with spiky ears and a black nose. A black, mask pattern surrounds its brown eyes. The upper half of its mouth is jagged, and when it is open, there are two pointed teeth in its lower jaw. Its feet have three claws and pink paw pads. Its forefeet are cream-colored, but the hind feet are brown. Its brush tail is spiky and bristly.
In Galar, the oldest and original form of Zigzagoon have a more black and white patterned-fur. The red eyes are surrounded by a black spiked mask. The black feet contains three sharp white claws. It has a long pink tongue that is constantly standing outside of mouth with two lower teeth in between.
Zigzagoon is abundantly curious, as it wanders restlessly back and forth while rubbing its nose to the ground in search of something. It rubs its bristly back hair against trees to mark its territory, and plays dead to fool opponents in battle. Zigzagoon is found commonly in grassy fields. The Zigzagoon in Galar are known to be constantly on the move and never settling down. It is believed that the zigzag movements of the Zigzagoon from other regions originated from its Galar relatives. They enjoy battling to the point they often attempt to prove others into fighting it. While this succeeded with other Pokémon, humans instead mistaken it wanting affection, much to the Zigzagoon`s frustrations.</description>

<description>Linoone is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation III.
It evolves from Zigzagoon starting at level 20.
In Galar, Linoone has a Dark/Normal-type regional form. It evolves from Galarian Zigzagoon starting at level 20 and evolves into Obstagoon when leveled up at night starting at level 35.
Linoone is a slender-bodied, quadruped Pokémon. Most of its fur is white, but it has several brown stripes. One long stripe stretches the length of its body before ending in an arrowhead shape on its forehead. The are additional stripes on each side of its bushy tail and on its cheeks. It has sharp, elongated claws and small pointed teeth. It has small, tuft-like ears, long cheek fur, and blue eyes.
Linoone can run up to 60 miles per hour, but has to stop before it can make a turn. It often fails to catch prey due to only being able to run in a straight line. When it sees prey underwater in ponds, it leaps in and uses its sharp claws to catch the prey. As shown in the anime, Linoone has an attraction to anything round, and will grab any orb-shaped object it sees if given the chance. It often carries a snatched object in its expandable cheek pouches and deposits it in any of a number of secret stashes it keep on its territory. Linoone tends to live in grasslands.
In Galar, Linoone has a black and white color scheme due to harsh environment in the region among with competition. This allows its survival instinct to improve, leading to the ability to evolve into Obstagoon. Its eyes are red while covered with a stripe shaped like a shooting star. It has longer claws with grey fur surrounding the front feet. It also has sharp teeth on the upper mouth with a long red tongue sticking out.
Galarian Linoone are know to be rash and fearless. It prefers recklessly challenging opponents that are stronger than itself. Linoone is known to use its long tongue to taunt opponents. Once the foe is fully enraged, Linoone will hurl itself at the opponent, tackling them by force. These traits make Galarian Linoone very popular among unhappy and angry youths in Galar, who have nowhere to take out their anger and frustrations on. By charging at up to 60 miles per hour, it can deliver powerful Tackles and Headbutts with enough destructive force to even knock away a car. Linoone can be thrown off balance should it miss, however.</description>

<description>Beautifly is a butterfly Pokémon and one of two flying insect Pokémon forms that Wurmple can eventually take. It can be considered a modern counterpart to the earlier butterfly Pokémon species Butterfree, but it is definitely the physical counterpart to Dustox, the other form into which a Wurmple can eventually evolve. Beautifly is a very vain and colorful butterfly with a long, coiled, needle-like mouth not unlike the proboscis of a real butterfly, which it uses both for gathering pollen in the wild and, despite their gentle appearance, for aggressively attacking opponent Pokémon when angered. It is most active in the springtime, where it rides the spring winds as it flits around gathering pollen from flower-covered fields, or from potted flowers left on windowsills.
In the Pokémon anime, Beautifly becomes May`s primary Pokémon for use in Pokémon contests early on, and Jessie`s Dustox is established as its rival.</description>

<description>Lotad is both an aquatic and a land-dwelling Pokémon, found in the Hoenn region, with a lilypad growing on its back. This species lives in groups at ponds, with their bodies submerged while suspended at the surface by their buoyant leaves, as a measure of hiding from predators. When on dry land, Lotad scuttles towards other ponds because its leaf is too heavy to support, in contrast to Lotad`s ancient ancestors which were one primarily land-dwelling Pokémon. Lotad and its evolved forms have mouths resembling duck bills, which may be a pun on the duckweed.
In the Pokémon anime, a Lotad becomes one of the Pokémon in trainer Brock`s possession in the third-generation Hoenn story arc in a development considered ironic because previously Brock primarily used Pokémon of the Rock and Ground types. His Lotad eventually evolved into Lombre, and then Ludicolo.</description>

It is also a mischief-maker: When a Lombre spots anglers, it will tug on their fishing lines from beneath the surface and enjoy their consternation. It also takes great delight in popping out of rivers and startling people.
In the Pokémon anime, the Lotad in trainer Brock`s possession during the third-generation Hoenn story arc evolves into a Lombre over time, and later on into a Ludicolo. As a Lombre, Brock`s is quirky and dense.</description>

It will courageously stand their ground against foes, taking on Pokémon like Skarmory with an equal footing. This gutsy Pokémon will remain defiant even after a loss. This however is in stark contrast to when it becomes hungry; it cries loudly. As a result of its relative youth, it sometimes becomes lonely and cries at night. It feeds on Wurmple that live in forests.

It never misses its targets in this respect. Swellow is quite fastidious with its own body, especially its wings. When it is not cleaning its wings and tail feathers regularly, two Swellow are gathered together and unhesitantly take it upon themselves to clean each other`s wings. A Swellow`s tail feathers indicate that the individual is healthy if the feathers are standing at attention. Though it`s name suggests it`s based on a swallow, Swellow has many characteristics of a falcon

<description>Shedinja is a unique species of Pokémon that is quite literally the shed exoskeleton of a newly evolved Ninjask that has taken on a ghostly transformation of its own. Their hard-layered bodies are hollow and utterly dark, and they do not possess organs normally considered vital for life. There is a circular dark hole in its back which the Ninjask would theoretically climb out of after its evolution, and an old legend states that a Shedinja will steal the souls of anyone who looks into the opening on its back. Like shed exoskeletons, Shedinja are completely immobile and do not breathe.[3] They are able to float and hover, however, though its wings do not move. They also have a halo-like object above their heads, suggesting the iconography of death, as Shedinja is technically undead.
In the Pokémon games, due to its extremely frail nature, Shedinja only has one hit point no matter its level. To compensate, it has a unique ability known as Wonder Guard. Because of this ability, Shedinja can only be damaged by the five attack types which deal super-effective damage to it, namely, Fire, Flying, Rock, Ghost, and Dark type attacks. Weather effects such as hail or sandstorm will also harm Shedinja.
In Pokémon Sapphire, Ruby, or Emerald, Shedinja is not found in the wild, but can be unlocked if you leave an open space in your party and evolve Nincada. Shedinja will be located in the empty space.</description>

<description>Exploud is the final evolved form of the Whismur evolutionary line. This large, imposing purple creature has a body and vocal cords that are specifically constructed to emit noises and sounds of any decibel level, high or low. The holes seen all over its body actually serve a dual-purpose; They can violently inhale air, signifying that Exploud is about to let loose a huge bellow loud enough that it can be heard from over six miles away and strong enough to trigger earthquakes. Exploud employs this as its offensive measure against opponents in battle. The holes themselves can emit sounds as well. The sound-generating organs hidden at the base of each tubular hole can be adjusted by Exploud for tone and volume, and whenever Exploud lets loose a bellow, the noise is amplified by these organs. When communicating with other Pokémon such as other Exploud, it emits slighter whistle-like sounds from its sound tubes instead of its normal voice.</description>

<description>Makuhita is a basic species of Pokémon found in the Hoenn region. Makuhita has a spirit that is tireless, gutsy, and tenacious. They are said to never give up hope, even against physically superior opponents. Its daily routine is said to involve a lot of harsh training, much like the Pokémon Machop, and its training increases its power and durability. It is thought that Makuhita regularly train in the secluded environs of a cave, and people around these caves have often reported hearing rumbling tremors from within the caves. Its body training is noted to always be accompanied by ample food consumption and sleep, for it is the goal of a Makuhita to gain enough weight and body mass to evolve into its bigger, fatter form of Hariyama.</description>

<description>Hariyama is the larger and stronger evolved form of the Makuhita species. Hariyama appears like a sumo wrestler; its hands are large and orange, and it wears blue trousers with a yellow tare - one of kendo bogu. Hariyama trains by stomping on the ground to build power, and it gains enough power so that its arm thrusts can snap telephone poles in two and send ten-ton trucks flying. Although it appears fat, its bulk is made up almost entirely of muscle. If Hariyama were to tighten these muscles, it would be as hard as a rock. It has been known to challenge people to contests of strength without any hesitation. It has even been observed to stand on train tracks and stop trains in their tracks using forearm thrusts as a display of its power.</description>

<description>Azurill, a species of Pokémon introduced shortly before the official start of the third generation of the Pokémon franchise as a "preview Pokémon", is the younger pre-evolved form of the Marill species introduced in the second generation. Its circular tail is large and rubbery, and Azurill`s playful nature causes it to often be seen bouncing and playing on its bouncy tail. The tail is vital both for survival in peacetime and self-defense in battle; It is packed full with nutrients that supply itself to Azurill`s body in order for it to grow. It is also a floatation device in water, much like the tails of its evolutions Marill and Azumarill. Its tail is about 1.3x as large as its body. Azurill`s most intriguing habit with its tail involves spinning its tail as if it were a lasso, then hurling it out with intense force. The momentum of the throw sends its body flying, too. Using this unique mode of travel, one individual Azurill was seen to hurl itself a record 33 feet.
In the Pokémon RPGs, Azurill can only be acquired by hatching an egg produced by Marill holding the Sea Incense item. In the Pokémon anime, trainer Misty owns one after her previous "baby" Pokémon, Togepi, evolved into Togetic and departed. This Azurill is the offspring of Tracey`s Marill. It is shown to have a sweet and caring nature and loves to play with the other Pokémon.</description>

<description>Skitty is a basic Pokémon species found in the Hoenn region. Skitty is a "cute" Pokémon, according to the Pokédex. It loves things that it can chase. Some times it even chases its own tail. Many people in the Pokémon world have them as pets.
In the Pokémon anime, trainer May has a Skitty that she uses for Contests. It can juggle and perform a variety of attacks, for which it also is useful in battle, when it is not chasing its own tail. May`s Skitty (like Jessie`s Wobbuffet, Misty`s Psyduck and Brock`s Croagunk) has a knack for coming out of its Poké Ball at some inappropriate moments, which may make May`s opponent think it`s her next battle Pokémon.
In Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, Skitty is one of the sixteen available starter Pokémon.Skitty is also playable in the game`s sequel and is one of three normal types.(the others being Meowth and Munchlax)</description>

<description>Delcatty is a highly laid back, unconcerned species of Pokemon. It prefers to live completely free of priorities, doing only what it pleases at its own pace. Since these include eating and sleeping, its daily routine is completely random. However, its activities are generally more nocturnal than not. Delcatty does not stake a claim on a personal lair like other more territorial species of Pokemon. Rather, it makes it a habit to wander about and seek out more comfortable spots when it decides it`s time to sleep. Even here it is not defensive; if another Pokémon approaches its spot, Delcatty will take off for another place rather than fight. Domesticated Delcatty are highly regarded by fashion-trendy female trainers who often use the Pokemon in competitions revolving around its style and fur.</description>

<description>Sableye lives in deep underground caves, where it leads a quiet life. It is a lithovore, meaning that its diet consists of rocks and minerals, which it uncovers from the ground using its sharp claws. When its body becomes saturated with substances derived from the rocks it eats, those substances crystallize and rise to the surface of its body, giving it a gem-studded appearance. Despite its hermetic lifestyle, Sableye is a cause of fear for many thanks to its eyes, which glitter eerily in the darkness of the caves it inhabits. In the Pokémon world, it is thought that a Sableye can steal a person`s spirit when its eyes shine that way. There is no attack type that is super effective on it, making it the first Pokémon without a weakness and the only such Pokémon until Spiritomb arrived in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.</description>

<description>Mawile appears to be a small, timid creature, but it is a deceptive Pokémon. It lures opponents into a false sense of security with its docile face and its harmless gestures. After doing so, it attacks with a set of flexible steel horns that can easily chew through iron. These horns act as a large set of jaws that bite foes, clamping them with the thick steel and puncturing them with the sharp "teeth". Not only can it bite opponents, but it can grab and throw them very long distances. Its design was based on a japanese legend about a woman with a mouth on the back of her head called a Futakuchi-onna. Its footprint is the only one to change through generations.</description>

<description>Wailord is a gigantic, oceanic mammal with the largest known size of all Pokémon. Living in the vast oceans of the Pokémon world, Wailord swims languorously in pods of about four members or more, often at the surface so it can breathe through its upper nostrils. With huge mouths these Pokémon can eat massive amounts of undersea food, such as krill, in a single gulp. When chasing somewhat larger prey, Wailord herd them by leaping out of the water and making humongous splashes in what is often described as a breathtaking display. If a Wailord inhales to the maximum capacity of its gigantic lungs, it is able to dive close to 10,000 feet below the surface. Optionally by puffing itself up, it can float high on the ocean surface or beach on a shoreline if it wishes.</description>

<description>Torkoal exhales an always present cloud of smoke through its nostrils and through holes in its body and has a dark gray stone shell. It also consumes coal. Torkoal fills the hollows in its shell with coal and burns it - its strength is diminished without this supply. It will search through whole mountains to find it. If attacked, this Pokemon spouts thick black smoke in order to retreat. If this is not possible, this Pokémon needs more coal for energy. It lets off a sound that is similar to a locomotive`s horn when emitting smoke from its nostrils.
In the anime, Ash and friends help protect a Torkoal from the guardian of the place which consists of a Steelix. After saving it, Ash captures it. His Torkoal displays a large amount of affection for him and usually starts crying at random moments since it has low self esteem and usually does everything wrong, like diving into the ocean. Upon his return to Kanto to participate in the Battle Frontier, Ash left Torkoal and Glalie with Professor Oak.</description>

<description>Spoink leads a bizarre, fragile existence. It moves around by bouncing on its tail. However, Spoink`s bouncing has an additional, far more vital role. The small shock generated by Spoink`s impact with the ground every time it bounces courses through its body and causes its heart to pump. Essentially, Spoink`s heart is jumpstarted every time it beats. If Spoink ever stopped bouncing, its heart would stop and it would die. Thus, Spoink constantly bounces up and down, even while sleeping.
Spoink exhibits its psychic powers best by focusing them through an object, which also serves to amplify them. This object is the pearl that a Clamperl makes once in its lifetime. The pearl size is also the amount of power the Spoink has. That is why it`s always looking for bigger pearls, it wants more power! The anime suggests that prolonged separation of Spoink from its pearl will weaken Spoink greatly, even risking death.
Spoink resembles a pig.</description>

<description>Flygon has its natural habitat in the desert, across which it flies. Flygon`s wings kick up a cloud of dust and sand each time they flap, so that whenever Flygon moves, it is surrounded by a constant sandstorm. This provides Flygon with a useful cover from enemies and other unwanted visitors who lose themselves in the dust cloud, while Flygon itself maintains perfect vision thanks to red covers that shield its eyes from the storm. But it is at a disadvantage in the jungle because the trees are so close together they cover almost the entire floor of the jungle from a bird`s-eye view. This Pokémon is known as "The Desert Spirit." When inside a Flygon-created sandstorm, the only thing one is aware of is the melodious sound of Flygon`s wings, which can resemble the notes of a song. Because of this, and the Pokédex related cry, it is thought that perhaps Flygon has the ability to buzz its wings at a rapid pace to create a melody.</description>

<description>Corphish is not indigenous to the Hoenn region, but to a landmass overseas. It was introduced to Hoenn as an exotic pet, but the species ended up familiarising itself so much that it now forms part of the local ecosystem. It`s unknown where it is native from. Corphish is a hardy and durable Pokémon; it can thrive almost under any condition. It can make its nest even in polluted water, and it will make a meal out of anything available, taking the term omnivore to extremes.
In the Pokémon anime, Corphish is one of the Pokémon that Ash has in his traveling team for the duration of Hoenn and the entire Battle Frontier challenge in Kanto. Corphish is friendly, but does not realize its own strength; it often ends up flinging Ash away while expressing its affection to him. Corphish is also short-tempered, and often tries to instigate a fight when peaceful solutions exist, and also gets jealous when one of Ash`s Pokémon evolve, since it wants Ash`s attention.</description>

<description>Kecleon possesses the ability to change its body coloration at will in order to blend with its surroundings, approaching invisibility. Kecleon puts this stealthy trait to good use when hunting, as it can sneak up on its prey undetected and trap it with its long and stretchy tongue. Kecleon does not have absolute control of its appearance, however: it can never change the color of the zigzag band in the middle of its body, which renders his cloaking useless to any fairly keen observer. Secondly, a Kecleon can involuntarily shift colors based on its emotions, so that a sudden mood swing will change its looks completely. Finally, a Kecleon will revert to its original colors if it is startled. In the video games, Kecleon`s unique Color Change ability changes its type to match that of the last damage-dealing attack that hit it.</description>

If a Chimecho wishes to remain in one place for a while, it employs its suction cup to affix itself on trees or the eaves of a building. Chimecho has the distinctive ability to produce a ringing cry, the volume of which is amplified inside its hollow head and comes out as a chiming sound. A Chimecho can produce seven different tones to communicate various messages to its kindred. If threatened, Chimecho can use its cries as a defensive weapon, turning them into ultrasonic waves that knock its foes back.
Although Chimecho did not officially exist at that time, a figure of it appears in the TV episode "The Ghost of Maiden`s Peak" on one of the small lantern ships (18:30-18:35 in the US version).</description>

If it can be seen slapping its tail on the ground continuously, it can be presumed that it is in an angry temperament.</description>

<description>Clamperl is protected by a sturdy shell. Once in a lifetime, it makes a magnificent pearl. This pearl, created upon evolution, is said to be infused with a mysterious energy and is used by Spoink as a focus for its psychic abilities. Clamperl grows while being protected by its rock-hard shell. When its body becomes too large to fit inside the shell, it is sure evidence that it is getting close to evolution. However its shell is not only good for protection - it is also used for clamping and catching prey. A fully grown Clamperl`s shell will be scored with nicks and scratches all over.
Clamperl first appeared in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, and can evolve into two different forms through trading via the Game Boy Advance`s Game Link Cable, depending on which of two different items it is holding-Gorebyss with the Deepseascale, or Huntail with the Deepseatooth. Both of these items are given to the player by Captain Stern after he is rescued.</description>

<description>Huntail went mostly unnoticed because it lives at extreme depths of the sea. Huntail`s body is built to withstand the adverse living conditions in the deep sea that challenge even the best-made human craft. The water pressure is high enough to be labeled crushing, but Huntail withstands it by having a body with a very thick and sturdy spine. Its eyes are suited for life far under the sea as well; they can see clearly even in the murky dark depths of the ocean. Huntail carries bioluminescence, which it uses when hunting prey. It lights up the eye-like textures on its tail and wiggles it to deceive prey into thinking they have found a fish to eat. Then Huntail attacks and attempts to swallow the prey whole with its gaping mouth. It prefers smaller prey since its body and stomach are rather thin.</description>

<description>Gorebyss inhabits the southern seas at extreme depths. Its body is deceptively durable, so as to withstand the extreme hydrostatic pressures exercised to it at such a depth. Gorebyss`s elegant form is exquisite to behold while swimming. Gorebyss uses its thin mouth to pick at seaweed growing between rocks, but it can also use it in a much more sinister fashion. When hunting live prey, it sticks its mouth into the prey`s body and proceeds to drain it of all bodily fluids. After it feeds in this way, its body turns a more vivid pink.</description>

<description>Relicanth is a rare and inaccessible Pokémon, as it inhabits the deep ocean floor. Once thought to be extinct, it was discovered in an exploration mission of the sea abyss. Relicanth proved to be extremely well-adapted to its environment; so much so, that according to researchers in the Pokémon world, it has not changed form in 100,000,000 years. Relicanth`s body is covered in rock-like scales which are tough enough to withstand the enormous hydrostatic pressures exercised on it at such extreme depths, as is the case with other dwellers of the abyss. It uses its multiple pectoral fins as a means of locomotion across the sea bed. It is based on the real fish, the Coelacanth.</description>

<description>Salamence is very happy at its successful acquisition of wings, yearning for them since being a Bagon, and expresses its feelings by soaring all over the sky, blowing fire from its mouth. Salamence is just as easily expressive when enraged: when angry, it loses all thought and destroys everything around it with its fire breath and shredding claws. Salamence is a very strong Pokémon because of its incredible attack and special attack, and therefore highly desirable to trainers. However, Bagon and Shelgon, its two pre-evolved forms are difficult to train and level up.
Salamence (and its pre-evolved form Shelgon) cannot be found in the wild, so Salamence must be evolved from a Bagon which can be found in Hoenn`s Meteor Falls. However, Salamence was obtainable at a Nintendo promotional event in which it was given out to players with the rare move Wish.</description>

<description>Kyogre is one of a trio of legendary Pokémon, alongside Groudon and Rayquaza. Kyogre represents Pokémon Sapphire and appears on the cover art for the game. Kyogre represents the primal force of the oceans; as such, it has the power to bring forth storms, constant rain and massive floods. It is part of the creation myth of the Pokémon world. According to legend, a titanic battle between it and Groudon created the oceans and the land, and the two were sealed beneath their respective elements. Despite being the creator of the oceans, Kyogre still came and helped Manaphy when it needed help as any other regular Pokémon would. Kyogre is similar to an orca or killer whale. It is a Water-type with the ability Drizzle, which makes the weather rainy until another weather move is used or a Pokémon with another weather altering ability is switched in.
In Pokémon Sapphire, Team Aqua tries to awaken and control Kyogre. It is awakened by a blue orb that the group actively seeks. They eventually awaken Kyogre, but they are stopped by the player in the video games. Kyogre made its first movie appearance in the ninth Pokémon movie, Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea. In the movie, Kyogre helps Ash, May, Pikachu, and Manaphy to protect the Sea Temple and defeat The Phantom.</description>

<description>Groudon is one of a trio of legendary Pokémon, alongside Kyogre and Rayquaza, that represents Pokémon Ruby and appears on its cover art. In the legend surrounding the three, Groudon represents the land, while Kyogre and Rayquaza represent the sea and the sky, respectively. Groudon, representing land, raised lands and expanded continents in legend. Coming as a savior for humans suffering from floods caused by Kyogre, it can dissipate clouds, and evaporate water with light and heat. After a titanic battle with Kyogre, it went to sleep in underground magma, causing volcanoes to erupt when it awakes. It is a Ground-type with the Drought ability, which makes the weather sunny until another weather move is used or a Pokémon with another weather-altering ability is switched in.
Groudon first appears in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire and Pokémon Emerald along with Kyogre and Rayquaza. Pokémon Ruby focuses on Team Magma awakening Groudon to take over the world, while Pokémon Emerald has both Groudon and Kyogre awake. The anime follows a similar structure, where both Pokémon are awakened, and forced to battle by Team Magma and Team Aqua. This is foiled by Ash Ketchum and Lance, and Groudon and Kyogre return to their respective elements after calling a truce. Groudon also plays a pseudo-role in the sixth Pokémon movie, Jirachi Wishmaker, where an evil being in the form of a Groudon is formed from the energy of Jirachi.</description>

At first glance, Budew barely has any similarities to its evolved forms, Roselia and Roserade. However, when the two "vines" that are on top of Budew`s head open up, a big spot can be seen on each vine (one that is blue and the other being red). As a matter of fact, the two vines are actually what will be the Pokémon`s flower-holding arms when it evolves into Roselia. Budew also appears to be wearing a green bib. This will become a skirt once it evolves.</description>

<description>Bonsly is a small pot-like creature resembling a bonsai tree. The creature was introduced in 2004 in an issue of Coro Coro Magazine. Bonsly makes its proper and most playable debut in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, the game it was first advertised as being involved in.
Despite its tree-like appearance, Bonsly is actually made of rock. Bonsly often shed tears, though it has been found out that those are "fake tears", and that it is adjusting its body fluid level (appropriately enough, it can learn the move Fake Tears, which sharply decreases its target`s Special Defense) Wild Bonsly exist only in the Pearl Version, and upon learning how to Mimic, they evolve into the familiar Sudowoodo.
Its first anime appearance is in the eighth Pokémon movie, Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. However, its name is mispronounced in that movie; Bonsly is to be pronounced similarly to "bonsai", half of its namesake, the other being sly, for shedding "crocodile tears" Bonsly also appears in the "From Cradle to Save" episode, where Brock obtains it. Brock`s Bonsly eventually evolved into Sudowoodo.
Although regarded as a 4th generation Pokémon, it was included in the 2005 game Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, where the player must rescue one from the wreckage of S.S. Libra and reunite it with its trainer, a small girl. It also appears as a statue in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon as a reward.</description>

It may or may not be able to comprehend what it is actually saying though, much like real parrots. If they gather, they all learn the same saying. It can also mimic sounds. When a Chatot learns its signature move Chatter, the trainer can record a custom call from the game menu. The sound is garbled to avoid the recording of obscenities. The player can trade this Pokemon for a Buizel in Eterna City.
Its head is shaped like a musical note and its tail like a metronome. Its body is covered with many multi-colored feathers giving it a resemblance to a black masked lovebird. Chatot can only be caught in the morning or during the day.

<description>Munchlax is the pre-evolved form of Snorlax. It wolfs down its weight in food once a day, swallowing food whole with almost no chewing. It hides food under its long body hair. However, it sometimes forgets it has hidden the food there. Munchlax behaves quite opposite of its evolution, Snorlax, as it is somewhat hyperactive, though it is very similar with its eating patterns. It does not mind walking and running from place to place as it looks for food. Munchlax eats the most food of any Pokémon besides its evolution, Snorlax. It will eat nearly anything. It can rarely become full and will eat constantly, unlike Snorlax, who eats in between sleeping.
One can obtain a Munchlax by breeding two Snorlax with the mother holding a Full Incense, or by smearing honey on trees and waiting to see if it appears. However, it is the rarest Pokémon to catch by doing so. Wild Munchlax can only be found in honey trees in the games.</description>

Male Croagunk differ from female Croagunk in that the white bands on their chests are lower than in the female, as well as the black band on both arms. Croagunk and its evolutionary form, Toxicroak, are a combination Poison/Fighting type, making it weak against Psychic moves, Flying moves, and Ground moves, but strong against Grass moves, Fighting moves, Poison moves, Dark moves, Bug moves, and Rock moves.
In the anime, Team Rocket leaves a Croagunk in the episode "Gymbaliar". Brock later befriends it and captures it. It has been known to use its Poison Jab move on Brock when he expresses interest in any woman. It takes the role of Misty and Max. It is a powerful fighter and only known losses were to Paul`s Torterra and Dawn`s Aipom, though it fought many Pokémon before it under Jessie`s control without rest.</description>

<description>Snover is a "frosted tree Pokémon," that first appeared in the 4th generation of Pokémon. Snover is a small, tree-like Pokémon that appears mid to late game. On its head it has a white hat-like structure resembling a mountain with three peaks.
In the spring, frozen candy-like berries grow around its stomach which are similar to frozen treats. Because of its lack of human contact, Snover is known to be boldly inquisitive. Male and female Snover vary in appearance by their stomach`s pattern, with the male having an extra brown zigzag. Snover, and its evolution Abomasnow, is a unique Grass/Ice type, giving it many different abilities than most Grass or Ice types. Its Grass/Ice combination, unfortunately, makes it weak against Fire types, Fighting types, Poison types, Flying types, Bug types, Rock types, and Steel types. On the plus side, the Grass/Ice combination makes Snover and its evolutionary form, Abomasnow, strong against Water types, Electric types, Grass types, and Ground types.
The ability Snow Warning is also unique to Snover`s line, and causes the weather to change to hail when Snover is brought into battle. This hail does not disappear over time, but must be overridden by another weather changing move or ability.</description>

<description>Abomasnow is the evolved form of Snover and, like its previous evolution, is a "Frost Tree", and has Grass/Ice typing. It blankets wide areas in snow by whipping up blizzards. In the Pokémon world, Abomasnow is the Abominable Snowman, and is also known as "The Ice Monster".
Its ability, Snow Warning, creates an everlasting hailstorm that grants its strongest attack, Blizzard, perfect accuracy. It can be found on the peak of Mt. Coronet and is the strongest Pokemon levelwise used by the seventh Gym Leader of Snowpoint City, Candice on Pokemon Diamond &amp; Pearl.</description>

<description>Magnezone, known as the Magnet Area Pokémon, is the evolution of Magneton, and has an appearance similar to that of a UFO. Magneton evolves from exposure to a unique magnetic field, which can only be found inside Mt. Coronet in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. This causes a mutation in the Magneton; one of the Magnemite that this Pokémon consists of has grown bigger than the other two; its pupil has dilated and turned red; and the screw on top appears to have been replaced by a yellow antenna upon evolution. The remaining Magnemite form the "shoulders" of Magnezone, and the screws on the top of their head have grown significantly larger. They also appear to have lost one magnet each. Magnezone has three horse-shoe magnets. Two are positioned in a fashion that resembles a pair of claws, and a third is positioned as a tail. Its body is surrounded by a thin metal rim. It is approximately three times heavier than Magneton. The body has a silver color like Magnezone`s pre-evolved forms. "Magneton must level up in Mt. Coronet in order to evolve"
In Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Darkness, a Magnezone serves as the police chief, taking away the outlaws the main character defeats.</description>

<description>Yanmega, known as the Ogre Darner Pokémon, evolves from Yanma from Pokémon Diamond and Pearl by learning the attack Ancient Power and leveling up. In battle, it moves faster each turn with the ability Speed Boost or increases the power of ineffective attacks with Tinted Lens. It is one of the few evolving from the learned move Ancient Power (others are Mamoswine and Tangrowth), though there are other Pokémon who evolve from moves, but the moves differ between Pokémon. Ultrasonic waves coming from Yanmega`s wings can cause lethal damage to a foe`s internal organs. It is known as the largest Bug Pokémon. It also has the highest Special Attack stat of all Bug-type Pokémon. Yanmega resembles a giant dragonfly, as does its pre-evolution, Yanma. Both Yanma and Yanmega`s names are derived from "Oniyanma", the largest of dragonfly species in Japan.
In the anime, Jessie owns a Yanmega. She captured it as a Yanma and gave it to Giovanni, but he rejected it and sent it back to her. She then trained it herself and evolved into Yanmega in the same episode.</description>

Leafeon has plant-like characteristics alongside its animal nature; as such, it is photosynthetic, and, as a result, it is always surrounded by clean air.</description>

<description>Glaceon, known as the Fresh Snow Pokémon, is one of two evolutions of Eevee that is obtained from training it in a certain location, the other evolution being Leafeon. The location necessary to evolve Eevee into Glaceon is on route 217 in the Sinnoh region. There is an ice covered rock here, but it is also possible to level up anywhere in grass on route 217 to evolve. Being an ice-type, it prefers cold climates, and as a protective measure it freezes its fur completely. This freezing causes the hair to resemble "ice needles."
In the Anime, May`s Eevee evolved into a Glaceon prior to her reappearance in the episode 544 `Restaurant Seven Stars! Tag Battle for a Full Course!` and Bianca got a same Eevee and now evolved into Glaceon nicknamed Iceshocker.</description>

<description>Mamoswine, known as the Twin Tusk Pokémon, resembles a cross between a pig and a woolly mammoth. Mamoswine`s name is derived from the words mammoth and swine. The tusks are much larger than those of Piloswine and seem to be shifted downward. The tusks of the male are larger than those of the female. The tusks are made from solid ice instead of dentin like most teeth are. Mamoswine were common around the Ice Age but their numbers dwindled as the climate warmed up. It is the evolution of Piloswine from Pokémon Diamond and Pearl onwards. It evolves when Piloswine is leveled up while knowing the move Ancient Power. In order to teach it this move, the player must dig up a Heart Scale in the underground, give it to the Move Maniac in Pastoria City and request Ancient Power from the list of past learned moves. However, Ancient Power is also an egg move for Swinub.</description>

<description>Gallade, known as the Blade Pokémon, is a human-like Pokémon that seems to be the masculine counterpart to Gardevoir. This Pokémon can only be a male, evolving from a male Kirlia when exposed to a Dawn Stone. The crest on its head is reminiscent of the helmet of a hoplite. Sharp, green, spear-like blades extend from Gallade`s elbows, which Gallade uses skillfully and powerfully in battle. These blades can be retracted into Gallade`s elbows when not in combat, possibly so that it does not somehow manage to hurt those it is close to. As its evolutionary line and Gardevoir resemble elegant female dancers, Gallade may be a dancer as well. If true, Gallade may be based partly on a traditional Brazilian dance called Maculelê, which involves dancing through expressive and athletic motions and a form of sword play. Gallade are valiant and noble fighters, adept at both melee combat and swordplay. They are noble in the sense that they follow strict codes of manners and conduct in and outside of battles. This sense of honor can be compared to that of a samurai`s or knight`s. Their behavior is quite similar, in that a Gallade, as well as a Gardevoir, will protect its trainer, even if doing so could end its life. Their names are based on the word "gallant" and "blade", which represents them in many ways.</description>

<description>Rotom, known as the Plasma Pokémon, is a small, floating Pokémon whose body consists of plasma, which can infiltrate electronic devices. They are mischievous, and wreak havoc on electrical appliances just for the fun of it. Pokémon Platinum introduced five new forms of Rotom: Frost Rotom, Wash Rotom, Mow Rotom, Fan Rotom, and Heat Rotom. Each form`s appearance corresponds to a household appliance (a refrigerator, a washing machine, a lawn mower, a desk fan, and an oven, respectively). In the Pokémon universe, researchers are looking into Rotom as the power source of a unique motor.
Rotom are shaped like lightning rods, while the blue aura of electricity around them takes the appearance of lightning. Rotom`s eyes and aura of electricity change colors when it changes form. Rotom`s looks and abilities were inspired by Pulseman, a game that GameFreak worked on before Pokémon. Rotom is the word motor backwards; this may refer to the fact that motors make many appliances function, while Rotom makes them fail.
The only available Rotom in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl resides in a possessed television in an old haunted château. You can only catch him after 8:00 PM but before 4:00 AM. In North America, Toys R Us gave out Secret Keys, which unlocked Rotom`s forms, via Mystery Gift from April 20, 2009 to May 12, 2009. The alternate forms of Rotom may also be accessed in Silph Co. in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver. In the anime, Rotom made its debut appearance in Get Your Rotom Running! in all its different forms, toying around with Ash and friends. In Pokémon Adventures, Rotom appeared in the television at the Old Chateau.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Sakaki is the head of Team Rocket, and formerly served as the Gym Leader of Viridian City`s Gym, known officially as the Viridian Gym. He handed out the Earth Badge to Trainers who defeated him. As a Gym Leader, he specialized in Ground-type Pokémon, but his master plan includes collecting rare Pokémon of all types.
Very little is known about his past in any timeline; he is generally shrouded in mystery. However, certain things are known:
His mother was the head of Team Rocket before him. However, this is presumed to be canon in the anime timeline only, as the games have no precedent for this.
While Sakaki very rarely takes the role of antagonist, his agents often have him in mind during missions due to the chance of power, be it through promotion or other means. This gave him a unique series of appearances, mainly during the Hoenn saga, where Nyarth often saw how the Pokémon in each episode could be used to help Sakaki and win the trio promotions. These boss fantasies never show his actual personality and occasionally even show Sakaki in chibi form.
The only time Sakaki has been seen in battle was in The Battle for the Badge. He used powerful Pokémon against Shigeru but later left the Gym to deal with an unexplained emergency, leaving Satoshi to battle Musashi. By the time Satoshi returned from Hoenn, Agatha was in charge of the Gym until a new leader could be found. Sakaki`s reasons for leaving it have not been explained, though it is speculated to be linked with the events of the aforementioned episode.
Sakaki is one of the three most prominent figures speculated to be Satoshi`s father, alongside Professor Okido and Silver. There is no evidence to support this, though Diamondshippers see Sakaki`s avoidance of Satoshi mentioned above as suspicious. In Pokémon Live!, it was claimed that Sakaki and Delia had shared a relationship as teenagers, though it is also stated that someone else is Satoshi`s father in that particular canon.</description>

<description>Jessie is one half of of the Team Rocket duo that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokemon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
Jessie`s mother, Miyamoto, was a high-ranking Team Rocket agent. When Jessie was around the age of three, Miyamoto left on a mission to the Andes Mountains to record the voice of the elusive Pokemon Mew. However, Miyamoto disappeared, and Jessie was put into a foster home which had very little money. There were times when she had no choice but to eat snow because of a lack of more nourishing food.
When she was old enough, she left home to become a Pokemon nurse in Jouto. However, the school she was enrolled in was literally for Pokemon nurses (i.e. Chansey), so she failed to graduate and left, leaving behind a Chansey she had befriended there. It is assumed that she then traveled back to Kanto, where she enrolled in Pokemon Tech, a trainer`s school, met James, and subsequently failed and dropped out. After this, Jessie and James joined a bicycle gang in Sunny Town, where Jessie was known for swinging a chain above her head as she rode her bike (nicknamed "Chainer Jess").
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between Jessie and James after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Sometime before joining Team Rocket, and it is not known when, Jessie obtained a Contest Pass in the Hoenn region. Also during the years before Team Rocket, she had several boyfriends, all of whom left her and/or treated her badly. In "Xatu the Future", she revealed that she had once worked at a T.V. station as the Weathergirl. In "From Cradle to Save" is also revealed that she once was a ninja.
She has a long-standing bitter rivalry with Cassidy, another member of Team Rocket. Another member, Wendy, held a grudge against Jessie for failing to pay for a drink (making Wendy pay), but got her revenge when she added the charge to Jessie`s overall Team Rocket bill.
In the episode "Ignorance is Blissey", Jessie was reunited with her friend Chansey from the Pokemon nurse school; Chansey had since evolved into a Blissey.
Starting in Hoenn, Jessie has become a Pokemon Coordinator, entering every contest that she could. She frequently makes it to the battle round, but usually loses there. However, in "Borrowing on Bad Faith", she finally succeeded in winning an (unofficial) contest by using Ash`s Aipom, which she had saved earlier in the episode. And, in "Team Shocker!", she finally wins an official contest with her Dustox in at Solaceon City. Later she also won a ribbon with help of her Yanmega. She has Contest Passes to compete in the Hoenn, Kanto, and Sinnoh regions.
While Jessie`s role in the Pokemon anime has not yet ended, in Toshihiro Ono`s manga, "The Electric Tale of Pikachu", she ended up married to James and with child.
Jessie seems to have a special preference for snake-like Pokemon, owning both an Arbok and a Seviper. In "The Ninja Poke Showdown", she expressed a preference for Poison-type Pokemon in general.
For unknown reasons, she, James and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation.
In the Kanto contests, Jessie disguises herself as Jessebella (which is similar to James former fiancee Jessiebelle) wearing a red dress and glasses. Eventually, Ash, Brock, Max and May finds out her true identity at the last contest.
During the Kanto Grand Festival, Jessie dresses up as Jessadia (Japanese: キャンディ・ムサリーナ Candy Musalina). and wears glasses, long white socks, a yellow and orange dress, and has her hair in pigtails. She works there as an announcer and Lilian Meridian`s assistant; Lilian herself says she may not really like "Jessadia"`s style, but recognizes her talent. In the Latin American dub, she enters Super Contests under the name Jessiebella (referencing Jessiebelle again). Jessie currently still continues to use the Jessalina disguise while participating in Super Contests.
In "Pruning a Passel of Pals!" and "Strategy With a Smile!" she once again used her Jessadia disguise to report on the Wallace Cup.
Although Jessie had entered mostly every contest in Hoenn &amp; Kanto, she lost in every single one, whether it was the first match of the Battle Rounds or the finals. But in the Sinnoh Region, she has so far won 2 ribbons using her Dustox and Yanmega.</description>

<description>Meowth is a very unique Pokémon as it has many of the characteristics of a human. It walks on two feet, talks and is as smart as any human. Meowth is currently a member of Team Rocket and he travels around with Jessie and James trying to capture Pikachu and other rare Pokémon for Giovanni.
Meowth generally finishes his sentences with "Nyaa (ニャー)" which is the equivalent of "meow" in English. This helps people remember that despite his ability to talk like a human, he still has cat character traits.
Meowth is also known for coming up with his many schemes to try to capture Pikachu. While Jessie and James always agree with Meowth and think his plans are brilliant, they are generally foiled by Ash and his friends.
Long Con to Access Raimon City Pokémon Center
Meowth schemed with Jessie, James and Doctor Zager to figure out a way for them to infiltrate the Raimon City Pokémon Center where high-leveled Pokémon are stored in a vault that is protected by a security machine scan system that would only open if Nurse Joy (Isshu) or Nurse Joy`s Audino were scanned. Meowth pretended to be no longer part of Team Rocket making up a story that his made an error while executing a certain operation and when headquarters hear of his mistake, they told him he was fired.
Ash, Iris and Cilan believed him and allowed Meowth to travel with him. Pikachu though didn`t trust Meowth even though Meowth proved on numerous occasion that it should be trusted. Meowth`s plan was put into action when they arrived at the Raimon City Pokémon Center and as soon as Nurse Joy`s Audino was scanned to open the door, Meowth turned on Pikachu and the other and captured all the Pokémon in the vault. The long con had been a success and Meowth met up with Jessie and James below the Pokémon Center. Unfortunately, they weren`t able to get away as Ash and his friends realized that Meowth had just been conning them and they were able to stop Team Rocket.</description>

<description>James is one part of of the Team Rocket trio that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokémon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
James is mostly a comedic parody of bishounen characters; the English dub in particular tends to give him a melodramatic and even campy tone. He is somewhat famous for carrying a rose, though in more recent episodes he does not display it often. Mostly, his rose is displayed in the Team Rocket motto.
The only child of millionaires, James was forced to endure formal society. At a young age, he was forcefully engaged to a girl of whom he was terrified, Jessiebelle, all because his parents wanted to have a wealthy daughter-in-law. Thus, he ran away from home, leaving behind his beloved pet Growlie. He attempted to enroll in Pokémon Tech, a trainer`s school, but, along with his new friend Jessie, flunked out. Then, with Jessie, he joined the Sunny Town bicycle gang, where he was popular for being the only gang member to have to use training wheels (nicknamed "Trainer Jim"). Eventually James, Jessie, and the bike gang went their separate ways.
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between James and Jessie after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Since he is proficient in several activities, including Pokémon haiku and PokéRinger, it is possible that he developed his skills during his temporary separation from Jessie, but this is not known for sure.
In the episode "Holy Matrimony!", James returned to his home as a result of a trap by his parents, who pretended to be dead. He was reunited with his old pet Growlie and managed to avoid marrying Jessiebelle. Growlie stayed behind when James returned to Jessie and Meowth.
James has a tendency to be swindled by a Magikarp Salesman, who has on many occasions tricked him into buying a Magikarp or other useless Pokémon and items for large sums of money.
James also has a tendency to cross-dress, but has not done it since "Pros and Con Artists". He does, however, dress up like famous celebrities as well, such as Professor Oak, Juan, and Norman.
James loves rare bottle caps and has an impressive collection of them. In the episode "All That Glitters!" it is revealed that he has "drunk enough soda pop to float an aircraft carrier".
For unknown reasons, he, Jessie and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation. However in newer episodes the balloon is shown with `jets` attached to explain how they get from one place to another faster than walking.</description>

<description>The Beginning
Ash is the main character of the Pokémon anime. Raised in Pallet Town, he started his journey to become a Pokémon Master at the age of 10. On the day that he started his journey, Ash carelessly woke up late despite being told by his mother, Delia Ketchum to get to bed. He rushed to Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory only to find out that the beginner Pokémon - Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander - had already been given out to trainers who arrived on time. However, Professor Samual Oak mentioned that there was one more Pokémon available - Pikachu. Despite constantly hitting Ash with Electric-type attacks and refusing to return to its PokéBall, Ash decided to take Pikachu along with him on his journey to become a Pokémon Master. Pikachu is cold towards Ash at first and laughs at his failures; however, when Ash saves Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow, he begins to warm up to his new trainer and the two finally become friends. After the battle with the flock of Spearow, a Ho-Oh is seen flying towards a rainbow in the sky. The PokéDex reveals that the Ho-Oh is an unidentified Pokémon. Thus, the journey of Ash and Pikachu begins.
Captures in Viridian Forest
While making his way towards Pewter City and his first Kanto League Gym Battle, Ash came upon a wild Caterpie deep within Viridian Forest. Instead of using Pikachu to battle against the wild Pokémon, Ash took his chances and threw a PokéBall without weakining the Caterpie first. Luckily, he was able to catch the Pokémon without any trouble. The capture of Ash`s Caterpie marked Ash`s first capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Caterpie the second Pokémon to join his team.
The next day, while continuing the trek through the Viridian Forest, Ash came up on a wild Pidgeotto. He tried to just throw a PokéBall like he did with Ash`s Caterpie, but Pidgeotto swatted the PokéBall away. Misty informed that he must weaken the Pokémon first before attempting to capture it. He called out Ash`s Caterpie to battle against, but Misty quickly informed him that Bug-type Pokémon are weak against Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeotto. After Pidgeotto dealt significant damage to Ash`s Caterpie, Ash recalled it and sent out Pikachu. Pikachu was able to use its Thundershock to weaken Pidgeotto and allow Ash to capture it with a PokéBall. Thus, this capture marked Ash`s second capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Pidgeotto the third Pokémon to join his team.
Later on, while still in the Viridian Forest, Ash was approached by Team Rocket, who attempted to steal his Pokémon. After defeating Meowth, James`s Koffing, and Jessie`s Ekans, Ash`s Caterpie evolved into Ash`s Metapod.
Some of Ash`s greatest accomplishments have been at the various Pokémon Leagues. He was the victor at the Orange League and the Battle Frontier. He also competed in the Indigo League and the Johto Silver Conference where he placed admirably in both those competitions as well.
Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup
Ash participated in the Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup at the Kagome Town stadium. In the first round he was in the fifth match and faced off against Marris. The match was quickly showcased and Ash won the battle and advanced to the second round while Marris was eliminated from the tournament.
The Isshu League
Ash participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where he was matched up against Trip. Trip`s Serperior was sent out to battle Pikachu and Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior`s speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter Trip`s Serperior speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round. The two met in the Pokémon Center after the battle, and Trip vowed that the next time they met that he would win. The two shook hands and parted ways.
In the first main round, Ash`s opponent was shown on the match up electronic board but not much else is known about the battle. Ash`s Scraggy participated in the second main round of the Isshu League tournament where it faced off against a Darumakka. It was able to defeat it so that moved on to the next round.
In the third round, Stephan was matched up against Ash. Cilan noted that the two of them have a very direct taste and that it would be a good battle. It was only a 3 on 3 battle but the both of them gave it their all. The first two battles of the third round setup the final match up of Stephan`s Sawk vs Ash`s Krookodile, both of which were very injured from the previous battles. Both of them did their best to muster up their reserve strength but in the end a surprise move of Aerial Ace by Ash`s Krookodile was super effective against Stephan`s Sawk and it knocked it out to give Ash the victory while eliminating Stephan from the tournament. Stephan realized after the battle that the reason that Ash withdrew Waruvial after the first battle was because Ash knew that Stephan would definitely send out Dageki, so he didn`t reveal that it knew Aerial Ace and saved until the end.</description>

<description>The Beginning
On the morning that Ash was to start his Pokémon journey, he woke up late and by the time he reached Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory, all of the beginner Pokémon were already taken. However, Professor Samual Oak did have one Pokémon left, a wild Pikachu. At first, Pikachu did not like Ash and would refuse to enter his PokéBall. He would often laugh at Ash`s failures and refused to listen to him. However, after Ash proved his loyalty to Pikachu by protecting him from a flock of Spearow, and thus began to earn Pikachu`s trust and respect. The two have since become best friends and Pikachu never leaves Ash`s side.
Since the day Team Rocket first encountered Pikachu, it has been their sole goal to capture it. Day after day, their plan to capture Pikachu has been thwarted mainly due to Pikachu`s amazingly powerful Thunderbolt that keeps on blasting them off.
On numerous occasions, Pikachu has made it evident that he is happy being a Pikachu and has no desire to evolve into a more powerful Raichu. It has proven time and time again that it is a powerful and worthy opponent to any Pokémon that dares to battle it.
Gym Battle against Burgh`s Leavanny
Pikachu was then sent out to battle Burgh`s Leavanny. Burgh`s Leavanny managed to tie up Pikachu with String Shot but unlike Ash`s Swadloon who was able to break free, Pikachu ended up getting hit with a couple of Leaf Storm attacks and a Hyper Beam before it rolled into another of Burgh`s Leavanny`s Leaf Storm attacks to break the string off its body so it could attack. Freed from the String Shot, Burgh`s Leavanny tried to tie it up again but Pikachu managed to avoid it with its speed and then knocked Burgh`s Leavanny out with a combination of Iron Tail and Electro Ball.
Gym Battle against Elesa
Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy and was then matched up with Pikachu. Pikachu made quick work of Elesa`s Emolga and knocked it out with one attack, its Iron Tail.
Elesa`s Tynamo was the last Pokémon that she used in her gym battle against Ash. It was matched up against Pikachu who had just defeated her Emonga. Pikachu had a hard time defending against the fast Tackle attack that Elesa`s Tynamo kept hitting it with but Pikachu used its Thunderbolt to create a large dust cloud leaving only a small corridor for Pikachu to focus on it and so Elesa`s Tynamo couldn`t maneuver out of the way. Pikachu one hit K.O`d Elesa`s Tynamo with a Iron Tail. The loss gave Ash the overall victory.
Battle against Alder`s Bouffalant
Ash challenged Alder to a battle and he accepted though he had been walking all night and was actually quite tired. Alder sent out his Buffron to battle Pikachu but just as the battle started, Alder fell asleep standing up and didn`t give any orders to his Buffron. Alder`s Bouffalant stood still as Pikachu began hitting it with attack after attack until it Alder`s Bouffalant finally got mad at Alder and charged at him and set him flying into a tree. After that, Alder`s Bouffalant no longer wished to battle and Alder conceded the battle.
Gym Battle against Skyla
In Skyla air battle simulation, Ash`s Tranquill was matched up against Skyla`s Unfezant and since her Pokémon was the highest evolved form, she determined that her Pokémon would be the winner in that match-up. In the actual gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was up against Skyla`s Unfezant which was the match-up just after Ash`s Tranquill had defeated Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla`s Unfezant proved to be stronger and faster than Ash`s Tranquill, so Ash recalled it and set out Pikachu. Pikachu had a definite advantage over Skyla`s Unfezant with its electric attacks and it quickly knocked it out with its Electro Ball attack.
Ash Just after Pikachu ended up knocking out Skyla`s Unfezant, Skyla`s Swanna was sent out to battle against it. Skyla had been watching her grandpa`s battle videos and noticed that he used the move Aqua Ring to defend against Electric attacks. She used that same defense against Pikachu which nullified its Electric attacks. It`s Iron Tail also couldn`t hit it so high in the air. Ash then noticed the rings in the air and Pikachu jumped up on them and managed to hit Skyla`s Swanna but not directly. Pikachu was now up in the air though and Skyla`s Swanna had the advantage there and it quickly knocked Pikachu out with a powerful Brave Bird attack.
Battle Against Trip`s Serperior at the Isshu League
Pikachu participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where it is was matched up against Trip`s Serperior. Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter its speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round.</description>

<description>While Wobbuffet is technically Jessie`s Pokémon, it has been around so long that it has become a main character, appearing in almost every episode of the series since it debut.
Wobbuffet was first seen walking around with Benny, his previous trainer. Jessie traded her Lickitung for Wobbuffet and it has been with her ever since that day.
Wobbuffet rarely battles but when he does, his Counter and Mirror Coat moves have proved to be very effective. Unfortunately, Jessie`s tactics aren`t always sufficient to master Wobbuffet`s superior defensive skills.
Wobbuffet also randomly comes out of his Pokeball, especially during the Team Rocket motto. He is also seen blasting off with Jessie regardless if he was actually part of the action.</description>

<description>He is a Pokémon researcher that was once a competitive Trainer, and is generally considered the best in his field. As such, his role in the Pokémon games and anime is that of a mentor to young Pokémon Trainers, a source of information and an occasional plot device. Amongst other things, he is credited with inventing the Pokédex. He also hands out a Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander to beginning trainers (depending on which Pokémon the trainer chooses) to start their adventure in the Kanto Region. Although he is an expert on all matters relating to Pokémon, Professor Oak specializes in Pokémon behavioural science. He appears in Pokémon 4Ever as a child who was pulled into the future by Celebi. Additionally, it is apparent after Pokémon 3: The Movie that he knew Delia Ketchum since she was a child; this most likely is the reason he occasionally exhibits parental-type concern (mainly in the form of scolding Ash as he is doing something that is dangerous). He also creates poems centred around Pokémon and is known as the rhyming professor by Dawn.</description>

<description>Pansage is known as the Grass Monkey Pokémon. It is part of a trio that seems to be inspired by the three wise monkeys motif; with its mouth open, Pansage represents "speak no evil". Pansage lives in thick forests, and shares the leaves on its head with exhausted Pokémon. They have the effect of relieving from fatigue.
In the anime, Cilan owns a Pansage that first appeared along with Pansear and Panpour owned by Chili and Cress respectively. In the Pocket Monsters BW manga, Cilan uses a Pansage against Isamu Akai`s Clefairy in issue 3 when he tries to instigate a fight between Cilan, Chili, and Cress. In the Pokémon Master Black &amp; White manga, Cheren uses a Pansage against Monta in a triple battle.
Game Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava stated that its ability, Gluttony, "almost makes up for the broccoli growing out of its head". GamesRadar`s Carolyn Gudmundson commented that it was the most appealing of the three monkeys, design-wise. She also compared it to Eevee and its evolutions, due to each one being of a different type: grass, fire, and water.</description>

<description>Patrat, known as the Lookout Pokémon, is a rodent-like Pokémon that resembles a chipmunk. It continues keeping watch for several days, saving up food in its cheek pouches. It signals to its companions with its tail. They are extremely wary and keep watch outside their burrows in turns. They become anxious if no one keeps watch.
Patrat first appeared in the first few episodes of the Pokémon: Black and White anime. Multiple Patrat made a brief cameo in Black and White episode 3 with multiple Pidove and Deerling where they needed help from Ash and his friends. In the Pokémon Master Black &amp; White manga, Monta captures a Patrat in the first chapter.
Patrat and its evolution Watchog were called "fairly unremarkable aside from their intense facial expressions" by GamesRadar`s Carolyn Gudmundson. Gudmundson later noted it as a "Bidoof analog", in spite of the fact that it can only learn one Hidden Machine, whereas Bidoof can learn many. She adds that it is very easy to become bored of it. Official Nintendo Magazine`s Chris Schilling commented that Patrat was the "new Bidoof".</description>

<description>Woobat, known as the Bat Pokémon, is a white, shaggy creature based upon the Honduran white bat. It has a piggish, large nose with a nostril in the shape of a heart. Its eyes are hidden behind two shaggy tufts of fur. It has a large mouth with a single fang, and two relatively small wings on either side of it. It lives in dark forests and caves. It explores its surroundings by releasing ultrasonic waves from its nostrils. It sleeps stuck on the walls of caves by its nostrils. It leaves heart marks on the places where it was stuck.
Woobat`s first appearance in the video games is in the two games Pokémon Black and White as a common Pokémon found in the wild. It eventually evolves into the Pokémon Swoobat by leveling up when its happiness is high. Happiness can be raised by fighting through many Pokémon battles. In the games, it was described as Black and White`s version of the Pokémon Zubat due to being of a similar species Woobat also appears in the Pokémon spin-off game Battle &amp; Get! Pokémon Typing DS where players type in the names of Pokémon that they see. In the anime, Jessie catches a Woobat while in a cave with James and Meowth. She uses it to battle against Ash and Iris. It manages to defeat Ash`s newly captured Pidove but is defeated by Oshawott`s Water Gun. Woobat has made other minor appearances in the anime. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, a Woobat is in the possession of the character White.
IGN described it as the baby of "a Tribble, a bat, and a pig". Game Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava stated "I kind of like the idea of having a romantic bat as a Pokémon... However, I`m not sold on its abilities". Jeremy Parish of Retronauts criticized the series` use of redundant new Pokémon, commenting that Woobat was the same as Zubat, referencing the uncanny similarities in name. IGN`s Jack DeVries questioned whether Woobat would act as a Zubat replacement. He later expressed that despite being unsure of Woobat`s quality, he wrote that "at least he`s not a Zubat". 1UP.com`s Kat Bailey wrote that Woobat was basically a Zubat with a pig`s snout. 1UP.com`s Michael Vreeland wrote that Woobat was "a lot more interesting" than Zubat. G4TV`s Nikole Zivalich, however wrote that Woobat was derivative and inferior to Zubat and that while fans will appreciate not having to run into so many Zubats, the "alternative isn`t much better". Carolyn Gudmundson of GamesRadar similarly described Woobat as the "new Zubat", noting that based on their looks, it and its evolution are two of their favourite Pokémon; however, they do note that they have some faults gameplay-wise.</description>

<description>Stunfisk is a dual-type Ground/Electric Pokémon introduced in Generation V.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
In Galar, Stunfisk has a Ground/Steel-type regional form.
Stunfisk is a flat, fish-like Pokémon with a broad, mud-brown body. At the base of its yellow tail is a yellow marking shaped like an exclamation mark when seen from behind. It has small, horizontal, oval-shaped eyes, white with a tiny black pupil and no irises. Almost exactly between these two eyes lies the two thick gray lips that form its mouth. It has two small, flimsy fins at the sides of its body; each with two lobes. It has been seen to leap into the air and flap its fins as if they`re wings to remain airborne.
Stunfisk`s very tough skin keeps them unharmed if stepped on, even by sumo wrestlers. To exploit this, it buries itself in mud of the seashore and waits for prey to pass by. Whenever unsuspecting prey touch a Stunfisk`s body, it is zapped. Stunfisk smiles when electrocuting its foes. If it cannot paralyze its foe, it contorts itself with unexpected speed and flops away.
Galarian Stunfisk is grayish-brown, with three green markings similar to footprints on its body. It cannot generate electricity, but the high iron content of the mud it lives in has strengthened its fins, which have been adapted into an apparatus akin to a bear trap. Galarian Stunfisk leaves its red and white lips visible to lure in prey, and then slams its fins shut on them so they cannot escape. It is the only known Pokémon capable of using the move Snap Trap.</description>

<gender>none/does not apply</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Xerneas is a Fairy-type Legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation VI.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
Along with Chespin, Fennekin, Froakie, and Yveltal, it was the first Generation VI Pokémon to be revealed to the public on January 8, 2013 as part of the Pokémon Direct broadcast.
Xerneas is the game mascot of Pokémon X, appearing on the boxart. It is a member of the aura trio with Yveltal and Zygarde.
Xerneas is a quadruped, stag-like Pokémon with four pairs of antlers. Its coloration varies slightly depending on which mode it is in: Active Mode or Neutral Mode. Regardless of mode, its main body is always black with a blue stripe down its back and a short, bushy tail. Starting at its knees there is a blade-like trim around each leg, which forms a point under each hoof. There is an upside-down, V-shaped marking on its chest in the same color as the trim on its legs. Its head and neck are blue, and there are two large, tufts that extend onto its chest and curve upward. Its first pair of antlers extends onto its head and curves around the underside of its eyes. The eyes are black with X-shaped pupils. There is a short marking on top of its snout and an upward curving horn on each side of its head in place of ears.
In Active Mode, its markings, antlers, and the trim on its legs is pale gold. Its antlers have branches and bumps in many colors and there are multicolored spots on its back. In Neutral Mode, its marking and antlers are instead pale blue and the embellishments on its antlers and spots on its back are a darker blue.
Xerneas has the power to share eternal life. This occurs when the horns on its head shine in seven colors. As seen in the anime, if it expends too much life energy it transforms into a tree and sleeps for 1,000 years. Xerneas is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Geomancy.</description>

This particular Froakie is a bit different to the other ones the professor had given out. It refused to listen to its trainers during battle, it ran away from a trainer simply because it didn`t like its trainer and several trainers have returned it to Professor Sycamore lab.
Froakie though took a liking to Ash and it came to the rescue when Team Rocket was trying to steal Pikachu. It also accompanied Ash up the Prism Tower when they went after Garchomp. Finally, as Ash was leaving the lab, Froakie appeared with its Poké Ball, indicating that it wanted to travel with him. Ash agreed and he caught Froakie.</description>

<description>James` Inkay was first spotted in Miare City when it ate James` croissant. It seemed to like the food that he was eating and it followed them on their journey. When they stopped to eat lunch, it appeared again and this time it ate his sandwich. In a quick battle with Wobbuffet, Inkay squirted ink all over its face. James then lured it with more sandwiches and then caught it with a monster ball.
James` Inkay often uses an ink squirting attack during battles but its not an actual move.</description>

<description>Ash`s Fletchling was spotted in the Route 4 forest when it stole the Pokémon food that Bonnie was trying to feed to Clemont`s Dedenne. Ash noted that the Fletchling was fast and that he wanted to catch it after seeing it move so quickly.
Initially, Ash`s Froakie wanted to battle but Ash told it not to be reckless and to let Pikachu handle the battle. Ash`s Froakie wanted to punish Yayakoma because Bonnie was looking so sad after trying to feed Dedenne. After working on a strategy, they picked a rocky area where Ash`s Froakie could combine the differences in elevation with Ash`s Froakie jumping power to achieve even higher levels of mobility to counter Fletchling flying speed. After an intense battle, Ash captured Fletchling and the two of them agreed to be friends from that day on. Bonnie forgave Ash`s Fletchling for stealing the food but gave it an Oran Berry as a sign of reconciliation.</description>

<description>Viola`s Vivillon is her pride as a Gym Leader and the Pokémon she often counts on during gym battles. It was the second Pokémon that Viola sent out to battle against Ash in both their battles.
In the first round, Ash`s Fletchling was defeated by Viola`s Vivillon after it got caught in the Sticky Web from earlier in the battle and couldn`t break free when Vivillon`s SolarBeam hit it.
Realizing that he needed to train his Pokémon some more, Ash`s Fletchling was able to learn from the training in the rematch battle and ride the wind better but it was still defeated by Viola`s Vivillon. Pikachu though still had damage left from its fight against Ametama but it overcame that and was able to wake up from Sleep Powder by using Electro Ball on itself. With ice on its wing, Viola`s Vivillon started moving strangely giving Pikachu the opportunity to knock it out with Thunderbolt to win the rematch gym battle.</description>

Pikachu had a hard time keeping its balance and was then knocked out by Viola`s Surskit`s Signal Beam.
In the rematch battle, the field was iced again but this time Pikachu stabilized itself by stabbing its tail into the ground. A quick Thunderbolt hit Viola`s Surskit and knocked it out.</description>

<description>The Citroid is an artificial life form created by Clemont. Clemont was so busy as a Gym Leader that he barely had any time for my beloved inventions. That`s when he got the idea of making a capable Gym Leader Robot that could help him with his Gym matches. It is currently the interim Gym Leader of the Lumiose Gym.
The name Citroid is a combination of Citron and Android.
Clemont initially incorporated his image of an ideal Gym Leader into the AI but it later proved to be too strict as it required challengers to have at least 4 gym badges. Clemont did a few tweaks to change its software to give it a more modest attitude, that the number of badges a Trainer has is irrelevant, added kindness to its strictness, to never forget to give advice to the challenger after the battle and finally compassion.
It has a Master Recognition Battle mode which requires an voice activation code in order to initiate the mode. During the initial setup, the Citroid was damaged and instead of Clemont having the code set as "Croquette" it set the password as "Please bear with me from today on. I`m Citron, the Gym Leader!". This caused Clemont a lot of problems as he couldn`t initiate the Master Recognition Battle mode properly. He finally figured out what happened as was able to initiate the code to do the battle to prove that he was Clemont.</description>

Team Rocket captured Professor Sycamore, Serena and Bonnie but Harimaron was able to follow a macaron crumb trail to their hideout. It was initially more concerned about getting the macarons back but it finally realized that Team Rocket was also a threat, so it helped out and manged to stop the Mega Mega Nyarth mecha.
During its time with Clemont in the crisis situation, the two began to bond and just as Clemont was leaving Professor Sycamore lab, it indicated that it wanted to travel with Clemont. Professor Sycamore gave Clemont Harimaron`s monster ball and he got it.</description>

<description>Princess Ally of the Parfum Palace is a spoiled brat that always tries to get her way. She visited Lord Shabboneau and took his heirloom Pokémon Flute. He didn`t protest as he owed a lot to Princess Ally`s father.
Ash and his friends confronted Princess Ally at the Parfum Palace to return the Pokémon Flute but she stubbornly refused. She took a liking to Pikachu and offered Ash gold and jewels in exchange for it, but he refused. She then offered to battle Pikachu for the Flute to which an angry Ash and Pikachu agreed to. Pikachu won the match against Princess Ally`s Furfrou but she tricked them as she said the flute was only the consolation prize.
Princess Ally then got a crush on Clemont after he stood up to her and began yelling at her and told her she wouldn`t have any friends if she kept being so selfish. She took his scolding as a sign that he liked her, which wasn`t the case. Bonnie agreed to allow Princess Ally to keep him in exchange for the Pokémon Flute. Clemont stayed at the palace until he created an android version of himself while he escaped.</description>

<description>Lord Shabboneau resides at Shabboneau Castle in the Kalos region. He is indebted to Princess Ally`s father.
Every year, once a Kabigon from the mountains has eaten all the roots, a festival with prayers for a good harvest takes place out of gratitude. At the climax of the festival, when the sound of the Pokémon Flute the lord of Shabboneau Castle plays reverberates on the plaza, Kabigon returns to the mountains while eating our offerings and dancing.
Lord Shabboneau lost possession of the Pokémon Flute the year that Ash and his friends were in the village. He kept lying to people by saying he had a recorder allergy that gives him hives when he plays the flute and that he developed a recorder phobia. It was infact Princess Ally from the Parfum Palace of the neighboring village who came for a visit and thought the flute was so cute and took it with her. Lord Shabboneau didn`t protest as he owed a lot to her father and didn`t want to offend her.
With the help of Ash and his friends, they were able to retrieve the flute from Princess Ally so that Lord Shabboneau was able to play it as part of the festival that year.</description>

<description>Aria in a Idol who is regularly featured in the "Best 10 PokéVisions (ポケビジョン・ベスト10)" and she started off in idol Pokémon unit with her Fokko and they are now immensely popular. Bonnie thought that Serena was in no way inferior to Aria.
While on their way to Shoyo City, Ash and his friends stopped at a Pokémon Center and watched PokéVision. The episode they watched featured Aria`s "Idol Life" (アイドルライフ) which was that week`s number one video.
Shauna told Serena while making Poffles at the Pokémon Summer Camp that Aria was now a Pokémon Performer and had become a major player there. Trainers participating in Tripokalons are called Pokémon Performers. Aria still regularly uploads PokéVisions though despite participating in the tournaments. At the time of the Pokémon Summer Camp, Aria held the title of "Kalos Queen" as she had won each tournament three or more times and had entered the Master Class.
Ellena
While shopping in disguise in a town near Miare City, Ellena met Serena and the two of them spent the day together. Aria almost gave away her true name but caught herself. She dressed up in glasses and a hat.
During their time shopping, she gave Serena some advice and told her that Pokémon Performers always need to have the biggest smiles and that Serena needs to smile always.
Ellena suggested that they have a double battle and by fighting together with her partner Pokémon, Serena might make a discovery. She explained to Serena that in double battles, the cooperation between Trainer and Pokémon, as well as between the Pokémon themselves, is very important. The battle ended prematurely as Ellena received a phone call and had to leave. Serena later saw Aria on TV and realized that Ellena was Aria.
Aria and Serena were matched up in the Kalos Queen final round. Aria`s Vivillon was revealed at the beginning of the performance and it lifted Aria up in the air to make it look like she was flying. The performance was enough for Aria and her Pokémon to defend their title and retain the title of Kalos Queen by defeating Serena.</description>

The two battled in a 1-on-1 Mega Evolution battle and despite the type disadvantage, Alan held his own for most of the battle until he finally lost. Siebold was impressed with Alan as he was powerful enough to corner him even with a type disadvantage.

<description>Louden is the director of the Kojin Town aquarium. He knows everything about the area and has plenty of interesting stories to tell people that visit.
He told this story about the reason for the Gold Koiking statue: Long ago, free-dive fishing was popular in this area. Once, a fisherman was attacked with electricity by a Starmie while freediving and came on the verge of drowning. But just then, a huge, golden Koiking brought the fisherman to the shore, saving his life. Not only that, but there are occasionally some reports of the golden Koiking being seen.
When Louden told the mayor about it, that meddler went right ahead and had that statue built at the aquarium. Louden`s dream is to bring the real golden Koiking to the aquarium and show it to children from all around the country.
He spends many hours a day fishing to try to get the golden Koiking. On the evening Ash Ketchum and his friends were leaving, they saw the golden Koiking, finally confirming its existence. Louden told them he`d be sure to get the golden Koiking by their next visit to the aquarium.</description>

<description>Grant`s Tyrunt was the second Pokémon that Ash Ketchum faced in his Gym Battle against Grant. Ash Ketchum noted after consulting his dex that he and his Pokémon would have to be careful of that huge mouth and those fangs that Grant`s Tyrunt has. Bonnie also commented that Grant`s Tyrunt looked like a formidable opponent right from the start.
Ash`s Froakie was the first to face Grant`s Tyrunt having defeated Grant`s Onix. Ash Ketchum underestimated Tyrunt and Draco Meteor ended up knocking out Ash`s Froakie. Ash`s Fletchling was the next Pokémon sent out to fact it but it was also quickly overpowered and knocked out of the air with Dragon Tail.
The final matchup was Grant`s Tyrunt vs Pikachu and Grant thought Ash Ketchum was bold for using an Electric type against Tyrunt as it is both a Rock and a Dragon type and had an overwhelming advantage. Pikachu used a move Ash Ketchum called Draco Meteor Tomb where it was able to deflect the attack with Iron Tail. After using Rock Tomb, Pikachu was able to deflect one of the rocks into Tyrunt`s mouth and finish it off with Thunderbolt.</description>

Rocket Gang noted that having a Lucario that could Mega Evolve and could defeat Pikachu was a Pokémon worth capturing. For a short time they managed to capture Korrina`s Lucario but Rocket Gang ended up being the 100th straight victory as they were sent off flying.</description>

He told Korrina that the Evolutionary stones were available in caves deep within the mountains near the town but he said he didn`t know specifically about the location of a Lucarionite but he did tell her that he had heard there`s a cave where there is a special stone. He warned though that rumour states that if someone unqualified enters it, something terrifying will happen. Korrina believed that the stone was the Lucarionite and head off to find it.
Upon returning to the town, she met up with Makita again and got a reprint of her picture which had burnt up in the battle to get the Lucarionite. Makita then revealed that her grandpa Gurkinn asked him to help him with the final trial to give her the Lucarionite.</description>

<description>Gurkinn`s Blaziken was first seen in the Lucarionite cave and it was the final trial Korrina`s Lucario had to overcome in order to obtain the Lucarionite to Mega Evolve.
Clemont noted in the battled that Gurkinn`s Blaziken moves very fast and is extremely strong. Despite knocking Lucario against the cave wall, Lucario was determined and it managed to fight back to the point that it had knocked Blaziken onto the ground and just as it was about to be knocked out, Gurkinn appeared and called the battle a win for Korrina`s Lucario.
Gurkinn had never revealed to Korrina that he had a Blaziken and he always knew she would finish her training and come to the cave for the Lucarionite.
Since Gurkinn was not commanding his Blaziken in the battle, the only move that can be confirmed is the Flamethrower that Ash Ketchum identified in the battle.</description>

<description>Hajime and Ryuji`s Father resides in the Kalos region near Hiyoku City with his wife. His family used to have picnics on a hill near their home but ever since he and his brother each got a Nyasper from their father and evolved them into Nyaonix, the two of them started butting heads. Ryuji wanted to prove that he could of use to his brother and father and vowed to his older brother Hajime that he`d become a stronger Pokémon Trainer than him. Disappointed that his sons were fighting, he set a challenge that whoever found the treasure hidden on their family`s premises would become his heir. After encountering a Bakuong, Ryuji and Hajime worked together to defeat it. It ended up being their father`s, as he wanted his sons to remember the time when they worked together. Their closeness is their family`s treasure and he didn`t want them to ever forget that.</description>

The habitat that Goomy was living in was invaded by a bunch of Pokémon and it escaped as a flock of Swanna fled the area. While on the Swanna, Ash`s Goomy got dehydrated. After consulting the dex, Ash Ketchum realized that Goomy like to live in damp, shady places, so its slimy body doesn`t dry out. It took Goomy to a nearby river to rehydrate.
Team Rocket captured it and Pikachu but it was mainly Ash`s Goomy that allowed them to get away and fend them off. It made Pikachu`s fur coat slick enough to get through the cage and during Team Rocket`s attack, it Bided its time and sent the group flying away.
Ash Ketchum realized that it wasn`t a weak Pokémon at all like the Dex said and he could feel its strong willpower. He asked it if it wanted to become as strong as Pikachu and to join him on his journey and it agreed to become part of the team.</description>

<description>Sawyer is a Pokémon Trainer that battled against Clemont in a Gym Battle at the Lumiose Gym. Only the end of the battle was shown where he was defeated by Clemont. He seems to be a beginning trainer as he was surprised how strong Gym Leaders were but was thankful for the Experience. He took notes from the battle for future reference. His name was confirmed in the Japanese closed captions. His first appearance in the anime was in the third Japanese opening.
In the original airing of the English dub of XY64, the closed captions listed his name as Scottie. In XY73, he is introduced as Sawyer.
He was later seen attempting to challenge Valerie at the Laverre Gym but he unfortunately arrived on the day she was debuting her Furisode Collection and was told he couldn`t battle her that day. He reunited with Clemont who introduced him to Ash and company.
While waiting for Serena and Bonnie to look at the clothes, Ash challenged Sawyer to a battle and the two decided on a Double Battle. Despite a type advantage, Ash`s battles are unpredictable because he negates type disadvantages like they are nothing and due to this and Sawyer lack of Double Battle experience, Ash easily won the match. He was grateful to battle though and gain the experience.
As part of an established custom at Valerie`s cloth collection show debuts, Valerie picks one person to battle with. She chose Sawyer and told him if he defeated her, she would give him a Gym badge. Unfortunately for Sawyer, he was unable to defeat her but was grateful for the experience and vowed to return to defeat her.</description>

After Valerie`s Sylveon was defeated, Valerie`s Spritzee was matched up against Ash`s Fletchinder. The match was dominated by Valerie`s Spritzee Trick Room. Ash Ketchum kept instructing Fletchinder to use Flame Charge despite being under Trick Room`s effects which actually has the opposite effect and lowers its speed. Ash`s Fletchinder kept enduring attacks until the effects of Trick Room had warn off and he hoped that he could settle the match in one go but unfortunately the strategy didn`t pay off as Valerie`s Spritzee endured the Giga Impact and Steel Wing and knocked out Fletchinder with a Moon Blast.
In the final match up, Ash`s Hawlucha was sent out to face a weakened Spritzee. Once again Trick Room dominated the match-up but Ash`s Hawlucha had learned a new move, X-Scissor which was able to shatter Trick Room and its effects on the playing field. Valerie was surprised and it wasn`t much later that Ash`s Hawlucha took over the match and knocked out Valerie`s Spritzee with a powerful High Jump Kick.</description>

During the Gym battle against Ash Ketchum, it faced off against Ash`s Fletchinder in the first match up. Valerie talked to her Sylveon in Pokémon language and it was able to more or less understand what she wanted to do. Valerie`s Sylveon being a Fairy type is delicate but strong. It used its tail ribbons to its advantage during the battle to capture Ash`s Fletchinder from moving about but he countered that but charging right into Sylveon with Flame Charge. The battle came to a climax when the two charged at each other with Giga Impact and Steel Wing but Ash`s Fletchinder came out victorious and knocked out Valerie`s Sylveon to win the first match-up.</description>

<description>While training in a forest near Hyakkoku City, Ash`s Hawlucha found an egg which he brought to Ash Ketchum. He decided to go back to where it was found to see if there was a nest but by the time he got there, the egg started to hatch. Ash`s Fletchinder was instrumental in helping the egg hatch as it has an Ability called "Flame Body" that makes eggs hatch faster. Ash Ketchum and his friends didn`t know what kind of Pokémon egg it was until Noibat hatched.
Noibat cries by using the move Supersonic which is quite deafening and it won`t stop until Ash Ketchum pets it as it thinks he`s its parent. Its favorite food is fruit and it can tell the ripeness of a fruit.
Ash`s Hawlucha and Ash`s Fletchinder helped it learn to fly by teaching it first how to glide on the wind. After an encounter with Rocket Gang in which Ash`s Hawlucha protected Noibat it returned to Ash Ketchum and he asked Noibat if it wanted to travel with him and it agreed.</description>

His dream is to win the Sky Relay and he asked Ash Ketchum if he could work with him to attain victory together to which he agreed. He has never actually personally participated in a relay as he was never able to get three Pokémon that could fly. Whenever he sees a promising Trainer, he supports them though.
As he had watched many relay`s in the past, Oiseau was very familiar with the course. He knew all the intricacies and explained where they needed to look out for obstacles. He gave Ash Ketchum and his Pokémon a crash course the night before the race. He was very instrumental in setting up the strategy for the race by recommending Ash`s Fletchinder charge at full speed right at the beginning to be extremely effective in getting ahead of the pack because in the back there are many Pokémon, making it dangerous there.
He explained that the third segment is comparatively easy to the first two segments as its almost completely straight. Ash`s Noibat was recommended to fly that segment. He did notify them though that the valley has a steep drop-off where there are sudden gusts of wind sometimes.
Despite getting second in the race with Ash Ketchum and his Pokémon, he had seen the wonderful dream of winning and was grateful and moved.</description>

<description>Master Jingoro, the great wood doctor, lives near Hyakkoku City. He is known for his expertise in wood graphing and an article was written about him in a local paper managing to reattach a Mebukijika`s horn perfectly. Nurse Joy suggested to Serena that she visit him in order to get Serena`s Braixen`s twig fixed.
Initially Jingoro insinuated to Serena that if her and Braizen`s feelings were strong enough, he`d be able to put 100 percent of his effort into fixing the twig and the way to show that was to have a Pokémon battle with him as he believes they are the best way to know a Pokémon`s feelings.
After the battle, he revealed that by the time she had brought the stick to him, it was already beyond saving. He believed that Serena`s Braixen already knew the reason why he had her battle. he explained that it`s important to cherish tools, but as with anything, being too choicy about them is not a good thing. When Serena`s Braixen tried using Flamethrower with its broken stick, it turned into Fire Blast. It may have been coincidental, but it was Serena`s Braixen strong feelings that made Fire Blast launch from that broken stick. He finished off by saying that if it had feelings as strong as what he`d seen in the battle, he was certain that it could master any kind of tool.</description>

It was very shy, so she lured it by putting out Pofflés that she made and then did her Tripokalon performance to show Eievui her feelings.
Jessie also took a liking to it and also tried to get it by force though. She thought it had exceptional talent that would add grace to her magnificent performances. Serena and her Pokémon protected it for a bit but when Jessie`s Gourgeist used Seed Bomb on Serena, Eevee came to the rescue and used Protect to stop her from being harmed.
After being saved by Eievui, Serena asked it again if it would join her on her journey and it agreed. She captured it with her Poké Ball and then let it out to meet all the other Pokémon. It seemed to like Clemont`s Bunnelby but Clemont`s Chespin got a bit upset when it didn`t initially like it.</description>

The Forewarning
Carrie was first seen observing Olympia`s vision about the future of the Kalos region and having been unsettled about the prediction, she rushes off before Olympia can explain what it meant. As Professor Sycamore arrived at the Anistar Sundial, she hastily asked him what he was up to and begun to attack them with her Sigilyph, destroying their research equipment.
Ash vs Carrie
When Ash and the rest of the group arrived to see what was going on, she was shocked at his arival and sent out her Sableye to attack them with Power Gem. She was then involved in a double battle with Ash and was easily defeated. Once defeated, she attempted to send out a third, unknown Pokémon however she was stopped by Olympia`s Meowstic, who gave the PokéBall to Olympia. She was then reprimanded for her actions and was made to apologize to both Sycamore and Ash for the trouble she caused.</description>

Sheryl explained that Olympia learns about the future by being guided by the voice of the stars. The incident off the coast of Houen was also allowed he to predict the incident with Groudon and Kyogre beforehand. Even though the world suffered from abnormal weather, her prediction enabled people in the Kalos region to take all possible countermeasures, so nothing serious happened.</description>
