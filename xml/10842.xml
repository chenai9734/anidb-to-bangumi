<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="327371">So... This show made to post my first review in this site after years!! a good plot, good animation, interesting characters, good music, so what can go wrong? horrible direction!! without a good direction to connect all the above and make a interesting show those all go to waste. statistically speaking, 1/3 of time of each episode you see characters walking in a slo-mo and showing to you how cool they are... the show has a very very slow start and when it starts you somehow come to the conclusion that every 2 ep. could be 1 ep. because of all time wasting and empty scenes I`m not against artistic and beautiful scenery but everything has a limit. anyway with all that said i still give this series 6 for Art,music and plot. watch it just for those and be patient.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="261990">Watch it for art. It`s interesting and fresh. Cannot say this about rest.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="118349">So... this series has a REALLY slow start, in which "kill the aragami before they kill you" is all that matter... anyway, after the first half, it become really interesting with a serious-sided plot development, along with a better understanding of the characters! The only demerit point that I can find in this series is the end, that isn`t an end at all... So, here I am, hoping in a sequel! Highly recommended!</recommendation>

<description>The military, also known as the armed forces, are forces authorized and legally entitled to use deadly force so as to support the interests of the state and its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its citizens and the prosecution of war against foreign powers. The military may also have additional functions within a society, including construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding critical areas.

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>The conspiracy thriller (or paranoid thriller) is a sub-genre of the thriller which flourished in the 1970s in the US (and was echoed in other parts of the world) in the wake of a number of high-profile scandals and controversies (most notably Vietnam, the assassination of President Kennedy, Chappaquiddick and Watergate), and which exposed what many people regarded as the clandestine machinations and conspiracies beneath the orderly fabric of political life.
The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top".</description>

<name>post-apocalyptic</name>
<description>An anime that takes place on future Earth (or it could be an alternative universe) after a major cataclysm has occurred. World War III, an alien invasion, plague, global warming or some other general disaster are common themes to build a post-apocalyptic world upon, where the effects were severe enough that mankind barely survived.
The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologised). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in an agrarian, non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of technology remain. There is a considerable degree of blurring between post-apocalyptic fiction and that which deals with false utopias or dystopian societies.</description>

<name>gore</name>
<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<summary>After the success of the last mission, Lenka`s punishment for insubordination is suspended and he is assigned along with Alisa and Kouta to Rindou`s unit. Kouta brings Lenka to the town and introduces him to his mother, and shows him the Aegis, which is being built on an island across the bay, which is supposed to provide shelter from the Aragami for the entire human race.
They are then sent on their first combat mission as a team, and are ordered to hunt a specific species of Aragami and recover their cores, which are to be used as components of the Aegis. Kouta panics, and Alisa does not seem to be working well with the rest of the team. After completing the mission they find a small family of survivors, and bring them back to base. These refugees are refused entry after they are found not to possess the factors required to become God Eaters.</summary>

<summary>Rindou, Lenka, and Sakuya fly a helicopter up to the transport plane, which is about to be overrun by flying Aragami. Rindou attempts to get Alisa to evacuate the plane for their helicopter, but she refuses, and goes out onto the plane`s fuselage and tries to fight off the Aragami attacking it. Soon enough her situation becomes desperate as there are too many of the monsters and they begin to evolve into more powerful forms, and Rindou and Lenka jump to the plane to try to take her off it by force. Lenka learns why she refuses to leave: the plane is actually full of injured people: a disaster seems to have befallen the Russia branch. He tells Rindou of this and he decides to help. Lenka begins to learn from Alisa how to use his abilities as a New Type. They are called `God Eaters` because they can use their God Arcs to literally consume the Aragami. They eventually succeed in getting most of the Aragami to ignore the plane by sacrificing the helicopter.  In the distance, they see a truly immense Aragami flying.</summary>

<summary>After the battle, Lenka is imprisoned for insubordination in a military stockade, awaiting a formal court martial. He does not remember much of the battle after a very large Aragami they called Vajra appeared and attacked him. Rindou comes by to visit him and tells him some details of the battle that occurred after he lost consciousness, of how Eric, the God Eater Lenka was trying to save, sacrificed himself near the end of the battle, preventing an Aragami from killing Lenka.
Meanwhile, Fenrir is sending another New Type God Eater named Alisa from the Russia branch to the Far East Branch as part of their overall strategy. The squadron of planes escorting her are attacked by airborne Aragami just as she approaches the base. Most of Rindou`s squad-mates are off on other missions, so he convinces Tsubaki to let him take Lenka on this mission.</summary>

<summary>The world has been almost completely overrun by mysterious monsters known as Aragami. Utsugi Lenka has been chosen to become one of the God Eaters, warriors wielding weapons known as God Arcs, the only weapons effective against the Aragami. Though the base is under attack by Aragami, Lenka and his friend Fujiki Kouta are ordered by their commander Tsubaki to train, which he does gladly, hoping to soon become strong enough to fight the Aragami, though his simulated training is less than successful. Later, the base is under attack from two sides and is nearly overrun, as the remaining defenders are too far away. Lenka asks to join the battle but Tsubaki orders him to stand down. He disobeys, and is nearly killed, losing his God Arc early in the fight. The First Unit, led by Amamiya Lindow, arrive in time and manage to defeat most of the Aragami. Lenka notices one surviving Aragami attacking a woman. Retrieving his God Arc, which initially took the form of a sword, he tries to save her, but he is too far away, however he manages to make it transform into a gun, which he uses to shoot the Aragami. This impresses Lindow and his companions: Lenka is evidently a `new type`.</summary>

<summary>Lenka and Alisa are in desperate straits, as they are deep in an area swarming with Vajra. Lenka`s God Arc was broken in the battle with the Dyaus Pita and is no longer effective against Aragami, and Alisa`s was lost. After resting and treating their injuries in a ruined building they search for Alisa`s God Arc. Alisa recalls in her mind how she had seen the Pita before, and how it had murdered her parents. They find Alisa`s weapon in a stream. As she picks it up, she is surrounded by several Vajra, but is frozen in terror as the memory of her parents` deaths haunts her. Rindou arrives just in time to save them.</summary>

<summary>Lenka, still concerned about the plight of the refugees who were refused entry, asks what is the status of the construction of the Aegis and is told that they are only 0.06% of the way there. Meanwhile, Rindou and Soma are assigned to a different mission. Lenka asks Sakuya if they can hunt stronger Aragami whose cores will help the construction of the Aegis proceed more quickly, and she proposes that they attempt to hunt the large Vajra Aragami. They manage to kill one, but find themselves surrounded by several of them in an area with many civilians. The Vajras are attacked by a strange and very powerful black Aragami called a Dyaus Pita that was only previously conjectured. Sakuya orders them to retreat as their weapons prove ineffective against it, but it manages to quickly incapacitate her, Kouta, and Alisa. Lenka manages to damage it slightly, strengthened by his need to protect the civilians, but ultimately the Dyaus Pita breaks his God Arc and seriously wounds him. He attempts to escape with Alisa, but they fall down a pit with the Dyaus Pita behind.</summary>

<summary>Both of the New Type God Eaters at the disposal of the Far East Branch of Fenrir are out of action, Alisa suffering from severe psychological trauma, and Lenka`s God Arc is broken. While Lindow is sent on a solo mission, Sakuya leads the 1st unit along with the 2nd to hunt more Aragami. The mission quickly goes bad as the ground collapses beneath their feet into a tunnel complex, and they are in dire straits as Aragami attack them from above. Tsubaki insists that they attempt to get aboveground, but Lenka says that would be suicide, and that they should instead go through the tunnel complex and find another exit. Sakuya listens to Lenka`s advice and manages to destroy the Aragami in a pincer move.
Johannes explains about Meteorite, their new strategy for defeating the Aragami, which involves using special devices that are capable of attracting them and separating them by species so they can be more easily destroyed.
The chief scientist of Fenrir, Paylor Sakaki, personally examines Lenka`s God Arc and realises it has broken because Lenka`s compatibility rate with it is too high. He also determines that this also means that Lenka will die soon as it is too much for him to handle.</summary>

<summary>Rindou brings Alisa and Lenka to a village where he sees the girl who was part of the family refused entry into the Fenrir base. The village is protected by a forest of Aragami trees which are capable of devouring most of the lesser Aragami who try to enter. It turns out that Rindou has been sending the refugees whom Fenrir would not accept to this place, and they have managed to live there, albeit precariously, with a hydroelectric dam providing them with power. The village is later attacked by several powerful Aragami that the trees could not stop, and Rindou has to prevent more from entering while he assigns Lenka to deal with the one that got through. Alisa is still deeply traumatised and cannot help, so Lenka has to make a plan that involves manoeuvring the Aragami such that it falls into the river and can be washed away by opening the dam. He realises that his God Arc is not completely broken and manages to use it to push the Aragami into the river as planned.</summary>

<summary>Sakaki explains further about Lenka`s predicament, stating that if he stops using his God Arc he will probably be able to live for about another three years as the damage has progressed so far, but if he uses it that will shorten his life rapidly. Lenka asks Sakaki to fix his God Arc anyway, and also to keep his condition a secret from everyone else.
Later, the operations for the beginning of Meteorite are explained. Teams of God Eaters are to bring the beacons that attract Aragami into place, and keep them safe from the Aragami. Lenka is chosen to be the leader of one team, with Soma under him. He hears disquieting rumours about Soma, that he is some sort of "death god" as everyone close to him seems to die, so he investigates Soma, and learns that he is actually the son of Johannes von Schicksal, and is apparently the first God Eater.
During the operation, they drop the beacon from a helicopter and it is promptly attacked by Aragami, who push against the protective field and may destroy it. Soma drops down to attack, and uses a powerful energy blast attack that destroys many Aragami. He is pressed as there are too many of them, until Lenka goes down himself shielding the beacon with his God Arc, allowing Soma to destroy the last of the Aragami that stood between him and the beacon without destroying it as well.</summary>

Lenka acquires a new God Arc and gets Lindow out of harm`s way in the knick of time. Reasoning that someone must have set another guiding device that suddenly distracted the Aragami, Lindow sets out to find and destroy it. But Deus Pita appears before him.

<summary>Operation Meteorite, a plan to lure Aragami with a newly developed guiding device, is critical to the completion of the Aegis Plan.
