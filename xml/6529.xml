<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="8583">After being bombarded by an almost seeming endless barrage of moe lately, I finally found something that made me feel exactly like how I felt when I watched Cowboy Bebop (which was over 10 years ago)...jaw dropping and fantastic...this lines up next to the likes of Akira.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="278993">Best animated movie I have ever watched.
It`s better than Akira, Ghost In The Shell...
It`s AMAZING!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="221885">There`s some decent entertainment in here, but I feel it`s restricted by it`s length. They tried to put in lots of different elements like love, past, super weapons, aliens, politics, racing... in the end it feels like some elements are too shallow and underdeveloped. Still, decent entertainment.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="360093">Redline is what you get when you throw away everything in your brain that tells you "don`t do it". This is the anime born from the idea "why not?". Fast cars? Nitros? Explosions? Production costs? Why not? It is the product of seven years of production that nearly bankrupted studio Madhouse. And damn, it`s a masterpiece. I`ve watched too much anime at this point, and this blows everything else away in terms of animation. If you aren`t looking for something to challenge your mind, and are looking for a clusterfuck of exciting action, this is it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="386453">Alright... i went into the anime without any expectation besides "it shouldn`t be THAT bad with an average ratig of 8"... and what can i say... after the weird and somewhat confusing few minutes the anime got... weirder, but better. xD

It sounds crazy, but the anime is just one hell of of a crazy ride.
The Animations are really great, sometimes even ART and still crazy.
The action (explosions, fast... REALLY fast racing, shooting, everything you can think of) is just so much over the top, that it`s good again.
There is actually not much story except for trying to win THE race (redline btw), but somewhere down the ride you really root for JP and you want to know how it ends.

Seriously: Storywise it`s not a great anime, but if you want some over the top action with no much thinking and a great movie about racing, aliens and... did i already mention explosions... you don`t regret watching in the end: It`s for you.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="97041">Best animation I`ve ever seen. Each scene is like a work of art. Great colours and designs, and a wonderful soundtrack. Lacking on the plot side but makes up for it in thrills. It`s like a really long race that keeps you on edge.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="22660">You do not watch Redline for the plot. You watch it for the great animation and the all-out adrenaline pumping action interrupted by the right amount of calm sections to not overwhelm you completely.
If plot is the most important thing for you, look elsewhere. If you want to be entertained, this is for you!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="6929">Weird and crazy space Race ... not much of a story, a bit of romance, mafia, cyborgs, gals, magic, crazy rides and aliens.

And the human guy drives a Tans Am. XD</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="231479">There is no question in my mind that this is an anime everyone should watch regardless if you`re a fan of the genre or not. Nothing that I`ve seen in several years has made me smile this much while watching.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="523239">Mind Blowing...
I wanted to create a coherent sentence using every synonym of Epic and Awesome to describe just how over the top and action packed this movie is, but was unable to do that as I would have had to use all of them and create some new ones in the process.
Unfortunately the story is a bit lacking, although I don`t think my mind wouldn`t have been able to cope if this movie had a good plot line as well.
I don`t care what your anime preference is give this one a go. I wouldn`t usually watch something like this, but I was obviously quite pleasantly surprised.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="16938">Best movie of 2011, anime or not.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="177436">Incredible animation quality, with plenty of style and visual flair! They just don`t make animation like this anymore! Must see!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="476533">Slick and stylish animation combined with good humor and lots of action.  This movie really has it all.. it`s a must-see!  (Just a warning, there is nudity so this is not for the kiddies)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="129591">Pure animation, limitless action....</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="275578">You are in for one hell of a ride!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="76759">For 90 minutes of action packing, this cannot be beaten. Definitely worth watching in surround sound if you have it as well, the soundtrack just keeps pumping.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="348650">This is THE best animation I`ve seen IN MY LIFE. Every frame counts, no dead weight in the animation that it looks as fluid as water. Heck, it was so pretty my eyes couldn`t catch and take all of it in. The story is not the best, but this is an action adrenaline packed explosion! A must watch for everyone.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="307601">Don`t let the preview image fool you. Action packed and strikingly awesome. Only complaint was that there were a few holes in the plotline. However, the animation is superb and makes up for the plot. Gives you the tingles like TTGL would.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="587448">Must-see for anyone interested in animation and cinema.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="550129">Well, animation and sound are top-notch. The most eye and ear-pleasing one for me so far.
Notice that this anime taken 7 years and 100 000 frames done by hand (!). 
But, in my opinion, everything else - story, characters etc. - are nothing special, they are just there. Behind awesome cars.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="540669">In one word, epic!
Awsome unique style &amp; great story.
Definitely a must see.
One of the best ones out there.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="199844">*First, check to see if we share similar anime tastes.* Breathtaking animation. Usually, I wouldn`t speak highly of an anime lacking in the story department, but this is a beautiful exception. You owe it to yourself to see some of the highest standards in amazing art.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="42439">Superb animation, great directing, fast-paced action ... leaves you wanting more~~</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="275599">Action Packed Epicness! I`m not really a fan of the unusual animation style, but only for such the style itself, it just fit perfectly with the crazy adrenaline madness theme!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="323788">Story is simple but the pure awesomeness of this movie combined with the soundtrack is a must see for anyone regardless not matter if your anime fan or not.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="307198">The best animation, great action, excellent characters, good music, and... plot. :P</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="371767">This was a labor of love from everyone who worked on it. The story may be a bit weak, but everything else more than makes up for it: animation to drool over, character designs that are completely off its rocker (even for the crowds you only see in a single shot), music that has great synergy with the visuals... what else am I missing? It is rare that something is so good and entertaining that you don`t give a shit about the story. Other animated media will leave you disappointed after having experienced this.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="418149">Awesome movie! Wonderful animation, nice music, beautiful colours... Just have to see it!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="167706">A true milestone. Redline is an incredible demonstration of the true potential of anime. It couln`t have been portrayed in any other medium. Instant classic!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="497915">Definitely a masterpiece, as far as the animation goes. Story was nothing short of awesome, save for the ending. Highly recommended if you want a change of pace, something unique or a haven away from more "traditional" titles.</recommendation>

<description>The most dangerous and exciting car race in the universe is held only once every five years. And that`s tonight. The competitors are lined up at the starting block. In his vehicle, http://anidb.net/ch25067 [JP], the most daredevil driver on the circuit, is ready for the green light. Female driver http://anidb.net/ch25068 [Sonoshee], with whom he is secretly in love, is also on the starting line. She will stop at nothing to get on to that podium. In this race, not only is anything possible, but also anything is allowed. In fact, their adversaries have modified their vehicles to equip them with highly destructive weapons; with such participants, it is hardly surprising that Redline is forbidden by the authorities, who will try anything to halt the proceedings. These speed addicts have to put themselves in mortal danger to achieve their aim: eternal glory for those who finally mount the podium.
http://anidb.net/cr5160 [Takeshi Koike]`s first animated feature Redline was presented as an international premiere on the Piazza Grande (Locarno International Film Festival).
Opened in Japanese cinemas more than a year later, on the 9th of October 2010.</description>

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<description>The anime will fit this category if some or all of the action takes place on another planet which is supposedly in the same universe as Earth, not a complete fantasy world; usually there has to be some concept of space travel.

Although Moon is a moon, it also qualifies as Other Planet.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>mafia</name>
<description>A mafia is a type of organized crime syndicate whose primary activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions. Secondary activities may be practiced such as gambling, drug trafficking, loan sharking, and fraud. The term was originally applied to the Sicilian mafia, but has since expanded to encompass other organizations of similar methods and purpose, such as in "the Russian mafia" or "the Japanese mafia", and is applied informally by the press and public, but the criminal organizations themselves have their own terms; for example, the original Sicilian and Italian-American mafia call themselves "cosa nostra", while the Japanese mafia calls itself "yakuza".

<description>Science fiction stories usually focus on how situations could be different in the future when we are more technologically advanced; due to either our own achievements or having met with other civilizations whom we have learned from.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<description>The underworld we talk about here is not to be confused with the place where people are believed to go after they die, but the general term for organized crime. It is a shady world, unknown to most people, where illegal things like murder, smuggling, drug dealing and similar are happening daily. Groups known to be acting in this world are for example the mafia or the yakuza.</description>

<description>You can watch this movie without having to watch something else first. This tag should not used for sequels, side stories, or summary movies, but may be used if the movie is either the first anime in a franchise or a remake.
The movie must be feature-length. For shorts, use the `short movie` tag. In general, a "show-in-show" would not qualify as standalone. For example, an anime has a cartoon show within it. If the show within was released as an OVA or movie, it would not be considered standalone.</description>

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

<name>mind fuck</name>
<description>A `mind fuck` is a slang term which describes a work that uses literary devices such as nonlinear storytelling and plot twists in order to present convoluted, yet not conflicting, themes.
A creation is usually considered a mind fuck when a casual observer is not able to discern the true meaning of a work without making a serious attempt to unravel the themes presented or when the plot is incredibly difficult to follow.
Special examples of mind fucks involve a single plot twist which completely changes the viewer`s understanding of the events in a film or novel as well as the ideas it presents.</description>

<description>A term that has come to describe often exaggerated, very jiggly, fluid, and painstakingly detailed animation of female characters` bouncing breasts. 
The term has its roots in http://anidb.net/a185 [Top o Nerae!] — Gunbuster, Gainax`s first OVA (1988), in which the Gainax bounce is found unabated in the three female characters of Noriko, Kazumi, and Jung.</description>
