<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="527292">rhymesmatter you nailed it on the head of course definitely amazing not only does Cloud kick some serious ass butt it looks so beautiful! One of my favorite movies for so many reasons... if you havent seen it watch it right now... seriously watch it!!!
P.S. Tifa is way better and hotter then Aries there i said it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="423020">One of the great one out there, but mainly for the ones who already know and love FF7. Thus said, while the story is previsible and in no way extraordinary, the graphics are so out of this world (is there any other animated work approaching reality this much, except The Spirit Within ?) and the fights so memorables that I can only recommend to see it at least one time.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="452038">A MUST SEE for FF7 Fans.
I m one of those, soo 10+ for this fanservice :D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="384952">Fantastic movie, especially if you are a fan of the game. It is brilliant and the action sequences are breathtaking.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="422558">Would i ask too much if i wanted too see the original story with these CG`s?Anyway,about 5 years have passed and there hasn`t been an anime movie that has even comparable CG`s.If only the plot was anywhere near the original then this movie would be in the top 10 anime of all time.Damn,i am thinking of replaying my favorite game for a 4th time...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="430063">Don`t call yourself the FF fans before watching this.

The best 3D animated anime in graphic and story. It has an awesome detail on graphic. You`ll get amazed by watching this.</recommendation>

<description>Two years have passed since the final battle with http://anidb.net/ch569 [Sephiroth]...
Though Midgar, city of mako, city of prosperity, has been reduced to ruins, its people slowly but steadily walk the road to reconstruction. However, a mysterious illness called Geostigma torments them. With no cure in sight, it brings death to the afflicted, one after another, robbing the people of their fledgling hope.
And so http://anidb.net/ch544 [Cloud], who walked away from the life of a hero to live in solitude, must step forward yet again.
Note: On 16.04.2009 a "complete" director`s cut version of Advent Children was released. Released on Blu-ray only, it includes approximately 26 min of extra video scenes that enhance and expand the story of the original film.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>dystopia</name>
<description>A dystopia (from Ancient Greek: δυσ-, "bad, ill", and Ancient Greek: τόπος, "place, landscape"; alternatively cacotopia, or anti-utopia) is, in literature, an often futuristic society that has degraded into a repressive and controlled state, often under the guise of being utopian. Dystopian literature has underlying cautionary tones, warning society that if we continue to live how we do, this will be the consequence. A dystopia, thus, is regarded as a sort of negative utopia and is often characterized by an authoritarian or totalitarian form of government. Dystopias usually feature different kinds of repressive social control systems, a lack or total absence of individual freedoms and expressions and constant states of warfare or violence. Dystopias often explore the concept of humans abusing technology and how humans individually and collectively cope with technology that has evolved too quickly such as the car, the flamethrower or the microwave. A dystopian society is also often characterized by widespread poverty and brutal political controls such as a large military-like police.</description>

<name>improbable physics</name>
<description>The physics in this anime have little to do with real-world physics, and are actually very much exaggerated.
Examples: Cars hitting a tiny obstacle, but then flying through the air for no apparent reason, or flimsy bullets slamming heavy characters clear across the room.</description>

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

<name>post-credits scene</name>
<description>A little bit of the story is found after the credit titles. A little bonus for those patient enough!
This applies regardless of if the credits play over an ED sequence, or over the "regular episode" that continues to air into the credits.
A sequence at the end of an episode, showing what will happen in the next episode, is NOT a post-credits scene; that is a preview.</description>

<description>Abbreviation for "three-dimensional computer generated animation" or "computer graphics" (CGI). The traditional 2D art is enhanced by 3D imagery developed through computer modeling software. Done in the right way, this union of 3D in a 2D animated world can be a very beautiful relationship.
The difference lies in what lacks the traditional 2D animation all together and may give term to something produced entirely with 3D graphics (such as the 2006 remake of "Appleseed" , 2007`s "Vexille", the 2008 addition to the "Biohazard" series and the more well known "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within" and "Advent Children").</description>

An independent and strong-willed young woman with a motherly streak, Tifa is quick to hide her true feelings due to her shyness. She owns and runs a bar and restaurant called 7th Heaven, located in Sector 7 slums of Midgar, which also serves as an AVALANCHE hideout.

She is the last of the Cetra, an ancient race with powerful magical abilities, and so the Shinra Electric Power Company hunts her throughout her life seeking to exploit her powers. Aerith is portrayed as an independent, outgoing and kind young woman who displays an intuitive understanding of others at times, and is deeply in-tune with nature. During Final Fantasy VII Aerith is killed by Sephiroth, an event that has been cited as one of the most famous and influential moments in video game history.

<description>Sephiroth is the primary antagonist of Final Fantasy VII, and one of the major villains of its extended universe. A prototype SOLDIER and the strongest alive, Sephiroth is initially revered for his strength and hailed as a hero, until he learns and misinterprets his origins. Believing himself as the last of the Ancients, Sephiroth enacts a vendetta against mankind, with the ultimate goal of becoming a god and controlling the Planet. Sephiroth`s goals later on include defeating Cloud Strife, who has consistently foiled his plans. To this end, Sephiroth is frequently depicted as Cloud`s arch-nemesis.
Sephiroth is arguably the most popular Final Fantasy series villain - his appearance, name, and musical theme are all highly praised among fans and he has appeared in many spin-off titles. He is also consistently voted as one of the top video game villains in polls and lists on video game websites, such as GameFAQs and IGN.

<description>Red XIII, real name Nanaki, is a red lion-like beast that serves as one of the playable characters in Final Fantasy VII. Red XIII was the name he received as a specimen designation while held captive and experimented upon by Professor Hojo. Even though he is 48 in human years, his age is comparable to around 15 to 16 years old by his own species` standards. He fights alongside Cloud and his allies to fulfill his duty to the Planet to defend it as a warrior.
Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children:
At the intro, Red XIII is seen with two younger members of the species running in a barren area. And also when Edge was under attack by Bahamut SIN in 0009, he hastens there with Cait Sith on his back, and uses his claws and teeth to battle Bahamut SIN. He appears later in the film, aboard the Shera and once more in Aerith`s church. He is only given one line in the entire film, commenting on how some children still have Geostigma, and has a slight accent.

Despite his brash and sometimes violent attitude, Barret has a good heart, and is torn between fighting and caring for his adopted daughter Marlene.

<description>Kadaj is the main antagonist throughout most of Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. The leader of the Remnants of Sephiroth, Kadaj`s goal is to find Jenova, who he believes is his Mother, and conquer the planet. However, unknown to him is the influence of Sephiroth over Jenova`s remains, and so Kadaj is unaware that he is merely a tool for Sephiroth`s resurrection, although he knows that Sephiroth is more favoured by Jenova.
Kadaj, above his brothers, is aware of the existence and plans of Jenova and Sephiroth, as neither Loz or Yazoo even indicate they know Sephiroth exists. In spite of, or perhaps because of this, Kadaj`s dedication to his Mother`s cause is accompanied by a deep insecurity over his inferiority to Sephiroth in her eyes. Despite this, he is still a highly skilled warrior and a strong leader.</description>

He is described as being the embodiment of Sephiroth`s physical strength, as well as his fondness and emotional instability concerning "Mother" that Sephiroth shows during the Nibelheim incident. While physically the strongest of the three, Loz has a real soft spot, especially on the topic of Jenova, as he apparently cries a lot, a fact that Yazoo points out, often in mockery.
He is physically very bulky and muscular, akin to the likes of Barret Wallace. His silver hair is short and slightly spiky with sideburns, and he has green eyes. He wears his weapon, the Dual Hound, on his left arm and uses a Velvet Nightmare handgun otherwise. His torso is also covered over with crossing black straps and shoulder guards.</description>

He is, like his brothers, very strong and agile, although not as much as Loz. In battle Yazoo typically uses his agility to keep his distance and shoot his opponents up with his Velvet Nightmare - he is a skilled marksman with the weapon and is able to shoot off Cloud`s goggles at point-blank range while only scratching Cloud`s face. He usually battles alongside Loz, whose melee attacks and brute strength compliment Yazoo`s agility and long-range tactics perfectly.</description>

Rude is rarely seen without his long-time partner Reno and is rather quiet and taciturn, tending to relegate the talking to Reno. Rude is a superb physical fighter and prefers to use his fists in battle. He has a soft spot for Tifa Lockhart, demonstrated by the fact that he will not attack her if she battles him in their many encounters in Final Fantasy VII. In one of his rare lines of dialogue in Final Fantasy VII, he reveals to Reno he has a crush on Tifa, who is also a phenomenal physical fighter, although nothing ever comes of this crush.
