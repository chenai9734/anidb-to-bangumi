<name>moe</name>
<description>Moe is a Japanese slang loanword that refers to feelings of strong affection mainly towards characters in anime, manga, and video games. Moe, however, has also gained usage to refer to feelings of affection towards any subject. Moe can be related to lust; however, pure lust without other feelings is considered outside its scope. The word Moe originated in the late 1980s and early 1990s in Japan and is of uncertain origin, although there are several theories on how it came into use.
At the anime level, the http://anidb.net/t7146 [cute girls doing cute things (CGDCT)] tag may also apply.

<name>onmyoudou</name>
<description>Onmyoudou (also in`youdou, lit. "The Way of Yin and Yang") is a traditional Japanese esoteric cosmology that mixes natural science and occultism. A practitioner of onmyoudou is called an onmyouji.
Onmyoudou is based on the Chinese philosophies of Wu Xing (five elements) and yin and yang, introduced into Japan at the beginning of the 6th century and accepted as a practical system of divination. These practices were further influenced by Taoism, Buddhism and Shintoism, evolving into the system of onmyoudou around the late 7th century.
Onmyoudou was under the control of the imperial government, and later of the Tsuchimikado family of courtiers, until the middle of the 19th century, at which point it became prohibited as superstition.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>magic circles</name>
<description>A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised.
Traditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for non-magical work such as meditation.
Generally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Abe no Masahiro is the protagonist in the series. He is an Onmyouji in training and the grandson of the legendary http://anidb.net/ch8099 [Abe no Seimei]. When he was young, Masahiro`s spiritual sight was so strong that Seimei temporarily sealed it away until he was old enough to properly use it. After meeting http://anidb.net/ch8097 [Mokkun], Masahiro regained his spirit sight and embraced his destiny as an Onmyouji in service to the emperor.
He is friendly and kind to both youkai and people whom he seeks to protect from evil demons that had taken up residence surrounding the imperial capital. Although he is sometimes cocky and clumsy, there are moments when he utilizes powers beyond those of a mere apprentice, which is why Seimei claims he is the only one who can succeed him. Masahiro greatly resents being known only as Seimei no Mago (晴明の孫, Seimei`s grandson) and trains hard to surpass his grandfather.
He has two older brothers whom both are married and has families of their own. Narachika is the eldest in the family. His second older brother, Masachika is ten years older than him.
According to Ten`itsu, children in the Abe residence were often taken care by the twelve Shinshou. It was seen through flashbacks in the anime that Masahiro was taken care by http://anidb.net/ch8098 [Guren].
In addition to his magic, Masahiro later receives a sword called the Gouma no Tsurugi, a sword which was forged by Seimei which previously belonged to Suzaku. He was also given Kagutsuchi (軻遇突智) by Takao no Kami, flames that has the power to kill gods, in order to destroy the corrupted Guren.
In addition, he erased Guren`s memories that are about him, meaning that Guren will never remember the time when he met Masahiro in the form of a mononoke or the time when they were fighting demons together.
He cares a lot about his friends, his family and his love, http://anidb.net/ch8096 [Fujiwara no Akiko] whom he vows to protect no matter what.</description>

<description>Fujiwara no Akiko is an imperial princess and the daughter of the minister of the left. She and Masahiro first meet in the Imperial Palace after his coming of age ceremony and the two become good friends after he saves her from a demon attack. As the series progresses, both of them fall in love with each other.
Akiko is special, as she possesses the Kenki ability (the ability to see demons). Moreover, because of this, during the beginning of the series, the foreign demons constantly attack her to deliver Akiko as a sacrifice to their master. They manage to capture her but Masahiro and his allies were able to save her, but not before the demons gave a curse wound on her hand.Halfway through the series, Akiko`s father attempted to introduce her into the imperial court as a wife for the Emperor, thereby separating her from Masahiro forever. In her moment of sadness, Kyuuki was able to put a powerful curse through her wounded hand. While the curse was eventually removed, according to Seimei the after-effects of the curse were so serious to Akiko that an onmyouji was required keep the curse from overwhelming her.
As a result, she was not sent to imperial court -as that would bring bad luck to the Emperor- so her half-sister Shouko, who looks the same as her, was sent into the palace in her place. Akiko was instead sent to live with Seimei`s family to deal with the curse under the identity as distant relative of theirs. (There are suggestions that Seimei tricked Akiko`s father into thinking that so she and Masahiro could remain close, since he knows about their feelings for each other. However, it is also revealed Seimei was having difficulty in finding an auspicious date to send Akiko to court.)
It should be also noted that her Kenki ability is stronger than both Seimei and Masahiro because she was able to see a spirit that was possessing Masahiro while neither Masahiro nor Seimei could.
At the Abe residence, Akiko remains a strong help to Masahiro and helps around the house, learning to do things what an ordinary girl does, like going shopping by herself thanks to the help of Tsuyuki, Masahiro`s mother.
During the middle of the series (episode 10), Masahiro promises Akiko that he will show her fireflies at Kifune mountain next year at summer time. In the final episode of the anime, he is shown fulfilling his promise

<description>The greatest onmyouji in the history of Japan, Abe no Seimei is the grandfather of Masahiro. He is in his 80`s and he has twelve shikigami called the Shinshou whom he calls his friends under his command and is able to protect his soul, which takes the form of his younger self, outside of his body in order to aid Masahiro in combat. However, by doing so leaves his body defenceless if an enemy attacks.

Unlike the other members of the Shinshou, she specializes more in magic than combat, particularly healing and clairvoyance. However, she is still able to create defensive shields with her magic. When someone has a very serious wound, she heals it by transferring the wound on her, something her lover and fellow Shinshou Suzaku distresses over.

Suzaku has bright red hair and wears a white strip of cloth around his forehead, which was Ten`itsu`s. He is very much in love with Ten`itsu and is fiercely protective of her due to her wound transfer ability, going as far as to hit Masahiro after Ten`itsu saved him.

<description>Rikugou`s primary role is to be the on-call bodyguard to Seimei but he will leave Seimei`s side to aide Masahiro should he be ordered to. His sense of loyalty is so strong that he was willing to put aside his doubts regarding Masahiro`s abilities and accepted him as Seimei`s successor on little more than his master`s assurances. He differs from the other Shinshou in that he rarely use magical attacks, preferring instead to fight opponents with a barbed spear. He can also use his cape as a shield and create an explosive 360-degree shock wave of air by striking the ground with his weapon. He also has a chain that was used against the corrupted Guren but he overpowered him.

She specializes in close range fighting with twin sai. Unlike the others, Kouchin does not resent Guren as much and is actually his close friend shown in that he refers to Kouchin as `Kou`. When Masahiro asks him about this, he refused to respond. She has also watched over Masahiro when he was a baby together with Guren. She is very observant and has a clear grasp of all of the Shinshou`s personalities. She is also very good at noticing small details. Her second name from Seimei is Keito, (慧斗).

<description>Taiin is a wind user who resembles a young girl with high pigtails. She also has a childish personality despite living for so long. She was said to be rash by a fair few of the Shinshou. Tai`in attacks with mini tornadoes and can also use the wind to communicate and pass messages. She can also `read` the wind to know what is happening at other places but she is not good at it. Because of her personality, she is often at the receiving end of one of Byakko`s lectures with the current record that lasts 8 hours. Taiin does not like slimy things and often appears with Genbu. She can create a tornado to transport people to other places but the ride is usually very rough. A recurring gag in the series is that whenever she uses this, Masahiro and Genbu falls on the ground with only the other Shinshou remaining standing.

His second name from Seimei is Shouran (宵藍). Seiryuu cares about Seimei`s wellbeing more than any of the others. However, he always shows his care through anger.
