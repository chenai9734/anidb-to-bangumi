<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="63560">This has more story packed into it`s four episodes then sign had in 26, I recommend this to anyone who`s enjoyed any of the other .hack series anime.  Interesting story with likable characters.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="375241">Really atmospheric one, and a superb music score.
In some parts reminded me GitS SAC, which I like a lot :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="371481">Worthy continuation of .hack series following .hack//SIGN by giving new perspective to the whole matter called "The World". Animation is decent, it lacks action, romance or fanservice, but it doesn`t matter as it gives an excellently told story accompanied by great background music - Kajiura Yuki proved herself once more - in return. Thrilling journey to unveil the truth about a heritage, artificial world intertwined with reality and its influence on our society and a solid detective work make the show.

Underrated and most likely uncomprehended series that deserves more attention since it`s another world you can explore.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="377550">Definately worth a shot! Helps you to understand the story better if you haven`t played the games.</recommendation>

<description>http://anidb.net/ch9967 [Minase Mai] visits The World, a MMORPG, for the first time together with a friend, http://anidb.net/ch60065 [Tomonari Kasumi], using the hardware at the school club. Shortly thereafter she and her friend are found unconscious and are hospitalized. Mai regains consciousness quickly enough, but her friend stays in a coma. She decides to find out what caused this accident, for her sake and that of her friend. Mai suspects that the game had something to do with it, unthinkable, especially since 20 million users are playing it. But an encounter with a middle-aged man, http://anidb.net/ch60064 [Tokuoka Jun`ichirou], who had previously worked for the game company that created The World, confirms her worst suspicions. They decide to team up and investigate further...

<name>detective</name>
<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometers, about 30% of Earth`s total land area and 8.7% of the Earth`s total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

<name>ensemble cast</name>
<description>A show with an ensemble cast focuses on a larger group of main characters in a single plot narrative; anime containing several segmented plot narratives (such as episodic or arc-based plots) are excluded. As such, it doesn`t really have a "main" or "lead" character; instead, every member of the central main character group plays an important part in the show`s grander scheme; no single character is more important or prominent than the others (equality of importance). Further, subplots (if any) lead by each character in the ensemble have equal weighting in importance (or lack of weight).

* In a show where no single main character is more important or prominent than the others, 4+ main characters is almost always an ensemble cast.
* A show with 3 main characters of equal importance is likely also an ensemble cast; equality of importance must be considered carefully.
* A show with 2 main characters of equal importance is generally not an ensemble cast situation; however, on an exception basis where neither main character is considered an antagonist, a 2-main-character anime may be considered an ensemble (e.g. http://anidb.net/a11829 [Kimi no Na wa.]).

<description>For some people it is just a card- or board game. For others it is not just a matter of life and death — it is much more important than that.
Serious business basically describes a situation, when a show revolves around an activity where a sizeable portion of the in-series population takes it far more seriously than it should. If something`s popularity rivals that of Elvis, or if there are mainstream schools devoted to it instead of teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic; it is serious business.</description>

<description>Tokuoka Jun`ichirou is the former director of Japanese-language version of the game The World.
During his work he learned about strange events taking place in the game when players loose consciousness and fall to coma. Since the company - CC Corp - did not want to admit there is a flaw in the game, he was forced to resign from his position. He blamed himself as well as CC Corp for not realizing the flaw in the game earlier; as a result, he started investigating the comatose victims and their possible connection to find the main cause of this effect to get a proof against CC Corp.
His investigations lead him to http://anidb.net/ch9967 [Mai Minase] - a girl who felt unconscious, but awake shortly after. To help her boyfriend http://anidb.net/ch60065 [Tomonari Kasumi], who is still in coma, Mai agree to help him with his investigations. The clues they gather lead them to other two characters mentioned in the logs of Sieg, a character of Tomonari - Yuki-chin (http://anidb.net/ch9968 [Yuki Aihara]) and Kyo (http://anidb.net/ch9969 [Kyoko Tohno]). Together, they investigate the strange events taking place in The World as well as in the reality around them. In the end, they come across reference to the Epitaph of Twilight, a poem on whose bases The World was created. By the same time, they are contacted by Helba, a wavemaster and a skilled hacker offering them a help ... .</description>

<description>Tomonari Kasumi is the owner of powerful character in an online game The World named Sieg. His class in the game is a blademaster. Tomonari is a boyfriend of http://anidb.net/ch9967 [Mai Minase]. Moreover, he is one of the coma victims.

He conveys his feelings towards Mai shortly before the incident. As he asked her out, he wanted to show her The World since Mai never played the game before and teach her how to play it properly. After creating her a character and inviting her to the game, they are attacked by a strange PC. This results into them falling to coma. Unlike Tomonari, Mai awakes shortly after in a hospital. To help her boyfriend, Mai agrees to help to http://anidb.net/ch60064 [Junichiro Tokuoka] who investigates the cases of players falling to coma due to mistakes in The World.
