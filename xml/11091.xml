<description>The story takes place in two mountain villages separated by a fast flowing river. The divided communities feud with each other, with the young boys calling names and throwing rocks at each other across the deep gorge. A young girl on one side of the river collects flowers which she offers the boys on the other side of the river as a gesture of goodwill, but she is cruelly struck down by stones. A young boy tries to stop his older peers from continuing to throw stones at her and is struck down himself. From that moment on the feelings blossom between the girl and the boy, but the terrible current of the river and the traditions of their communities keep separating them. Eventually, the boy grows into a young man and decides to build a bridge to connect the two villages.

<name>puppetmation</name>
<description>A puppet is an inanimate object or representational figure animated or manipulated by a puppeteer. It is usually (but by no means always) a depiction of a human character, and is used in puppetry, a play or a presentation that is a very ancient form of theatre. The puppet undergoes a process of transformation through being animated, and is normally manipulated by at least one puppeteer.
There are many different varieties of puppets, and they are made of a wide range of materials, depending on their form and intended use. They can be extremely complex or very simple in their construction. They may even be found objects. As Oscar Wilde wrote, "There are many advantages in puppets. They never argue. They have no crude views about art. They have no private lives".</description>

<name>short movie</name>
<description>Typically used when an OVA only has one part and is less than the usual 20 to 25 minutes in length.
So instead of calling it a `short episode`, the `short movie` tag is more appropriate.</description>
