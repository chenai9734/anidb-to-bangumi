<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="303972">the pic threw me off a bit, but i rly loved this series from start till finish. There isn`t as much comedy in the 2nd season, and the OVA`s aren`t great, but the story kept me pretty much interested the whole time.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="558725">When i first started watching this anime i wasn`t expecting much, but after a few episodes i found myself charmed by the world of Kaleido Stage and couldn`t wait to see what Sora will do next. I strongly recommend this anime to anyone.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="558451">I still can`t believe how much I loved this! It is surprisingly good and hooking. At the beginning I was unsure whether or not I`d like it, but boy, I was sooo wrong. I loved it. I`ve watched this many times now and I would not remove even one episode of it. This will bring tears to your eyes and make you laugh. It is a great must see journey!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="534780">Just watched it again for the second (and entire) time and this show aged pretty well. Probably amont the best family-oriented motivational shoujo series of the 2000s. Loveable and evolving cast that get fleshed out until the end. And animation is top notch, particularly acrobatics. I recommend this series to any anime fan that respects itself. It`s a shame many forgot it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="400185">It`s a definite must see! It will bring tears to eyes due to extreme laughters, emotional scenes, both sad and joyful. Characters will make you root for them and at times will make you angry. It`s a series packed full of all kinds of emotions. Don`t miss it because of some premature prejudice.</recommendation>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

<description>A circus is a company of performers that may include clowns, acrobats, trained animals, trapeze acts, musicians, hoopers, tightrope walkers, jugglers, unicyclists and other object manipulation and stunt-oriented artists. The term circus also describes the performance which has followed various formats through its 250 year modern history. 
Philip Astley is credited with being the father of the modern circus when he opened the first circus in 1768 in England. Early circuses were almost exclusively demonstrations of equestrian skills with a few other types of acts to link the horsemanship performances. Performances developed significantly through the next fifty years, with large scale theatrical battle reenactments becoming a significant feature. [...]

All issues in the anime have been resolved, the love polygons sorted out, the conflicts resolved, the guy gets the girl (or the other way around), and everyone else lives on blissfully.
(Not very realistic, but then again this is anime.)</description>

<description>The story and its characters give off good vibes — includes elevated feelings of affection such as tenderness, sympathy and love, all in one package.

<name>tarot</name>
<description>The tarot is a pack of playing cards, most commonly numbering 78, used from the mid-15th century in various parts of Europe to play a group of card games such as Italian tarocchini and French tarot. From the late 18th century until the present time, the tarot has also found use by mystics and occultists for divination. Tarot cards are used throughout much of Europe to play card games. In English-speaking countries, where these games are largely unplayed, tarot cards are now used primarily for divinatory purposes.

<name>Layla Hamilton</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Layla is an accomplished and seasoned performer. She is a stubborn character and plays an antagonist-like role in the beginning of the story, but like many of the other characters, she finally befriends Sora after they become partners for Arabian Nights.
Layla is the daughter of Mr. Hamilton, a wealthy hotel chain owner; he would prefer Layla to be an actress and is frequently trying to push her into doing so, and he`s also very work-a-holic and had little time for his daughter. Layla eventually stands up to her father and rejoins the circus; she loves the Kaleido Stage because she clearly remembers how her deceased mother enjoyed going there. At the end of the first season, after attempting the great Mystical Act and seriously injuring her shoulder Layla gives up the circus and retires to Broadway.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Sora is the primary protagonist of Kaleido Star. Her parents took her to Kaleido Stage when she was young. Although they died shortly thereafter, and Sora was adopted by her father`s cousin and his wife, Sora is inspired by this childhood memory to become a member of the Stage when she reaches adulthood. With her adoptive parent`s hesitant approval she travels to the United States to audition.
While Sora wanders around lost, her bag is stolen. As a consequence of chasing the thief and speaking to the police, she is late to the audition; Layla will not allow her to audition, but the owner Kalos gives her a chance to perform in the actual show. Most of the cast do not accept Sora at first because of the special circumstances through which she joins; Sora wins them over with persistence and hard work along with a magnetic personality.</description>

<description>The daughter of a struggling standup comedian, Anna joined Kaleido Stage at the same time as Mia and Sora, and the three of them are all good friends. Anna`s boyish appearance appeals to many of the Kaleido Stage`s female fans. Anna feels that it is her duty to introduce comedy to Kaleido Stage and wants to focus on playing comical parts. However Anna`s ideas for comedic improvisation are usually pretty far fetched and are promptly shot down by Sora and Mia before they get off the ground.</description>

She has been a diabolo prodigy since she was nine years old, when she won her first diabolo tournament, and once went by the nickname of "The Diabolo Machine" due to her flawless performances and cold personality. Like Layla, Sora helps change Rosetta`s outlook on everything when they become friends. When Rosetta joins the main cast in the second season, she sees Sora as a role model figure and wants to be just like her while a strong sister like bond grows between them.</description>

May is a really good cook and she is often seen singing quietly to herself while doing activities. She also makes up names for maneuvers and everything she does like bursting through doors or going down the elevator. She also has many younger brother and sisters that root for her.

<description>Yuri, like Layla, is an experienced performer, yet he`s deeply traumatized by a terrible tragedy. His father, Arlon Brass, died attempting the Mystical Act, and he never forgave Kalos for letting his father die. Yuri plays a pivotal role in the second half of the first season when he betrays the stage, first by stealing away a good portion of the cast and later by buying out the stage and taking control of it. He later agrees to return it to Kalos if Layla and Sora accomplish the same Mystical Act that caused his father`s death; when they manage to do so, he fulfills his promise. In the second season, Yuri helps Sora get into the Circus Festival in Paris. He appears to be a bitter rival of Leon`s, and feels that he is responsible for the death of Leon`s sister, Sophie who was a lot like Sora in many ways.</description>

She is an avid fan of martial arts, and frequently proposes bizarre alternative methods to help Sora achieve her objectives.
Sarah is well acquainted with Kalos and has been with the Stage from the beginning, when she and Kalos were performing on the streets with another friend. This friend, Andy, returns once to try to persuade Sarah to leave Kaleido Stage with offering her a singing career, but she refuses.</description>

<description>Kalos is the head manager and boss of the entire Kaleido Stage and gives Sora many helpful pieces of advice throughout the anime. He also maintains high expectations of everyone he encounters. Before Kaleido Stage, Kalos was a stage magician and acrobat and used to perform on the street with Sarah and Andy; their past relationship is rather vague. Kalos founded Kaleido Stage with the money he got from the insurance company after he injured his fingers during an audition for a spot in Las Vegas. As a professional, he has strict standards when it comes to how things are run at the Kaleido Stage and how his performers should conduct themselves. While he`s firm in his decisions, occasionally he`ll give in and let people spread their wings as they please. Kalos is also the one who trained Yuri`s father, Arlon Brass, for the Mystical Act, but sadly this failed and Arlon died, traumatising Yuri and embittering him. He is the only person who can tell Layla and Sora how to train for the act.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Cathy Taymor is introduced in episode 34 during Season Two [Episodes 27-51] as the Writer and Director of "Salome In Vegas;" an Off-Broadway Stage-play starring Layla Hamilton. She is also presented as Layla`s "New Career Partner" who gave her the desire to perform once again after Layla exits Kaleido Stage due to an injury. Although she initially introduces herself kindly during Sora`s second one week leisure from Kaleido Stage; Cathy Taymor`s character is a fast-talking-fast-paced-brash-and-outspoken 30-something fireball of energy! Cathy`s relationship with Layla as her "New Partner" emotionally distresses Sora at first. Later in the series, much like with Simon Park [Episode 17], Karlos once again outsources an experienced Director to mentor Kaelido Stage`s budding Writer and Director Mia Guillem. This experienced Director is Cathy.
During production of "Romeo And Juliet" Mia Guillem falls in love with Cathy`s direct and take-no-prisoner`s-style and begins to look up to Cathy as her mentor. Later during the production of "Swan Lake" Cathy and Mia become close and trusting friends and together come up with amazing ideas for Kaleido Star`s version of "Swan Lake". Cathy is not presented in the series until after Leon Oswald and May Wong are theatrically introduced and Rosetta decides to join Kaleido Stage. Although Cathy`s introduction is somewhat more subtle in the second season of Kaleido Stage; Cathy is an important character who inspires and motivates nearly every character either directly or indirectly in Kaleido Stage.</description>
