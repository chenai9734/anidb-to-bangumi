<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>elements</name>
<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<description>Mecha in Japanese basically means mechanical things; everything from an electric whisk or a car to a spaceship or a robot. Here however we limit it to the more exotic things usually referred to as mecha anime: robots, whether controlled by a human or not, and their ilk. See Androids, Piloted Robots, Power Suits, Robot Helpers, Transforming Robots for a more specific classification.</description>

<name>Excellen Browning</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A purely fun loving entertainer it`s Excellen`s habit to tease younger and thus less experienced crew-members, especially Bullet, on private matters like relationships, always speaking in an unserious cutey-girly manner. She`s always first to add weird nicknames on others and intentionally mistakes idioms for some daily slapstick. Though showing this light hearted attitude most of the time, she still knows to act serious on occasions, as indeed she is very skilled in range fight and dodging attacks. Despite his cold treatment of her on the outside, she deeply loves her Kyousuke, always supporting him either on battlefield or financially after another lost bet. She`s also a hard-drinking woman, accompanying her superiors at times, as she just loves to entertain.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kyosuke is of hotblooded nature, a fierce close combatant, but stays quiet most of the time outside the battlefield, also making him an excellent tactician, whos foresight of enemy behavior never seems to fail. Famous for his unbelievable good luck to survive terrible accidents and dangerous combats likely unharmed, he also loves to gamble, always betting on the worst odds` side. He and Excellen form up a great combination in their PTs, also being a couple in private. Though Kyosuke constantly seems to ignore his girlfriend and her lovey-dovey sweet talk in public, he holds her dear more than anything else, so whoever might dare to harm her will be doomed to have summoned her darling`s true rage. He still holds his former commander Zanger in high regards, despite his betrayel, as he respects his reasoning and both share a similar personality, mostly stoic but "do-or-die"-mentality in battle. With Zanger gone, Kyosuke becomes also a mentor to Bullet, whos impetuous behaving has to be tamed at times.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Brooklyn "Bullet" Luckfield is a fictional character in the Super Robot Wars series. In the Original Generation universe, Bullet is already an Earth Federation Army pilot and student of the Jigen-Ryu tradition of swordsmanship, under the tutelage of Master Rishu Togo, alongside his senior, Sänger Zonvolt, to whom he shows great respect for (in the Alpha universe, Bullet does not actually meet Sanger until Alpha 3, and it is directly from Sanger that he trains to refine his skills). Bullet does not meet Kusuha until after the Divine Crusaders War, when he and the rest of the ATX Team are ordered to attack Kusuha and members of the SRX Team in a live-fire exercise. Bullet, upon discovering that a girl (Kusuha) is the pilot of the opposing Grungust Type-2, refuses to lay a hand on her. Although he is slightly reprimanded for his conduct, he is smitten with Kusuha the moment he sees her in person, but is too shy to display any romantic feelings for her.</description>

<name>Raidiese F. Branstein</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Younger son of Maier von Branstein and so brother to Elzam Rai didn`t follow a military career in the ranks of the Colony Corps as he broke away from his noble family early and left their home of colony Elpis. He adopted the name of Fujiwara from his late sister-in-law Kathreia, who he held in high regards, as he blamed her husband for her death during the terrorist encounter known as " the Elpis-incident". Still being a highly skilled pilot he shifted to Earth Alliance as test pilot for the RTX-007 Hückebein. A catastrophic malfunction of its black hole-engine left him heavily wounded, the reason he is hiding his crippled left hand under a glove. A calm and collected person with great pride from the start, this past forged him a slightly sinister character with lacking humor, resulting in the early quarrels between him and Ryu after being assigned to SRX-team thanks to Irm`s recommendation. Though just being a year older Rai always criticized and lectured him in an arrogant manner as he saw his team mate just as an inexperienced robot maniac-child without any sense of tactics and only limited pilot skills, but later acknowledges him due to his improvements as a comrade and also kind of rival. He feels a bit uncomfortable about the admiration 7 years younger princess Shine holds for him, as he became her "prince on his white horse", but indeed cares for her. Still he has to solve his issues with his brother as well as his cousin Leona as she tried to mediate between both. Being the only SRX-pilot without any T-LINK abilities Rai is in charge of the Tronium-engine of the machine.</description>

<name>Ryuusei Date</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>At 18-years old, Ryuusei Date is an extremely hot-blooded young individual. A mecha otaku, Ryuusei is heavily into mobile machines, specifically those of the super robot type. When he receives his R-1, he was disappointed at the fact that it was a real robot, but was surprised at the specifications of the SRX, where it is classified as a super. Ryusei has an odd habit of naming certain attacks, and often shouts them aloud when performing them, á la classic super robot pilots. He abbreviates some of the SRX`s and Banpreios` attacks with the words "Tenjou Tenga", literally meaning "Heaven and Earth".
Before joining the SRX Team, Ryuusei was a childhood friend with Kusuha Mizuha. Though she initially developed a crush on him, Ryuusei didn`t return the same feelings, either due to his obsession with mecha, or because he simply didn`t share them. He does show some support for the relationship she develops with Brooklyn Luckfield, however. His relationship with the rest of the female cast of Original Generation is still in question, but it seems he is exceptionally close with Latune Subbota and Aya`s sister, Mai. While he doesn`t show much interest in women, he usually says that mechs with feminine shapes and appearances, like Lune Zoldark`s Valsione, Lamia Loveless` Angelg or Virtual-ON`s Fei-Yen the Knight, are cute or sexy.
Ryuusei proves influential to the women he is close with. Both Latune and Mai have begun imitating his otaku nature in attempt to garner his attention, though this has yet to produce any significant results.</description>

<description>21-year old Aya Kobayashi is the oldest daughter of Dr. Kenzo Kobayashi, the creator of the T-Link System. As captain of the SRX Team, she often looks out for the well-being of her teammates, both on and off the battlefield. Aya is also an adept Psychodriver, in fact, a very powerful one, for she is the key in forming the mighty SRX machine. A nice, charming woman, who enjoys walking around art museums, she looked up to ex-SRX Team Commander Ingram Prisken a lot before he betrayed the team and allied with the Aerogaters.</description>
