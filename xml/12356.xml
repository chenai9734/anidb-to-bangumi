<description>After humanity became a spacefaring civilization, it encountered many aliens. However, upon discovering that these aliens were not yet developed, humanity established a Ministry of Supporting Foreign Civilizations, which uses Foreign Civilization Observation Officers to support and lift up these aliens behind the scenes until they become spacefaring civilizations. One such young officer named Tsujimoto Tsukasa and three female androids make failed first contact with Suwarisu, which throws the whole galaxy into turmoil.
