<description>Long ago, on an island called Altomare, there lived an old man and woman. One day, the couple found two small children lying on the shore, badly wounded. The couple took them in and took care of them, and the children quickly recovered. But then, the island was attacked by monsters. Within moments the island fell into the monsters` wrath. But then...Before the old man and lady`s eyes, the children who they had taken care of transformed into the Eon Pokemon, Latios and Latias. They called their family from the sky. They came, and carried a stone with them containing the power to force the monsters away. This gem was known as the "Soul Dew". Peace returned to the island. However, later in the present, a criminal duo - Zanner and Lions - are seeking Latios and Latias in order to take control of the Soul Dew. Taking a short break in Altomare, Satoshi befriends Latias and is now dragged into the situation helping to save Altomare from becoming swallowed up by destruction again.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<description>Any anime that is based on a role-playing game aka RPG. A role-playing video game is a video game which includes elements of non-electronic role-playing games. The player assumes control of one or several fictional characters (a party) who have joined forces in order to perform quests and overcome a great number of challenges and enemies, usually monsters inspired by fantasy, and, to a lesser extent, science fiction and classic mythology. During the course of the game the characters, or avatars, which are generally defined by quantized characteristics, evolve and improve in that their various attributes increase, as well as by gaining more powerful artefacts.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Wartortle known as the Turtle Pokémon, is a larger and stronger form that Squirtle takes when it gains enough experience. In the main Pokémon game series, a Wartortle is only acquired when a Squirtle grows past experience level 16 and is evolved into a Wartortle. Wartortle are more aggressive than Squirtle, and their shells often feature scratches obtained in battles with other Pokémon. Their ability to swim is greatly aided by their long ears and long, fluffy tail for balance. Their tails are long enough that when a Wartortle withdraws into its shell, part of the tail still sticks out. They can apparently live for thousands of years.</description>

<description>Caterpie known as the Worm Pokémon, are larval Pokémon found in the wild early in the Kanto and Johto regions. In main series Pokémon games set in these regions, Caterpie are among the earliest and easiest Pokémon species caught by players, as they are very weak. They can be evolved into their cocoon-like Metapod form and eventually into the butterfly-like Butterfree form. Caterpie in the wild employ biological adaptations to survive, much like real caterpillars, in that their green bodies are useful for camouflage in foliage, their eyes are patterned to scare away predators, their suction-cup feet allow them to climb any surface, and the osmeterium on their heads can project a horrid stench to repel predators. It bears a resemblance to the spicebush swallowtail caterpillar.
In the anime, Caterpie as the first Pokémon Ash ever caught in his trainer career, and it eventually evolved into a Butterfree and was later traded for a Raticate on the S.S. Saint Anne but is traded back later in the episode. Ash releases it later so it could mate with a pink Butterfree.</description>

<description>Beedrill, known as the Poison Bee Pokémon, are fully-developed, hornet-like Pokémon that have hatched from their pupal Kakuna forms. In main series Pokémon games, Beedrill are only acquired by training a Kakuna past experience level 10 and evolving it into a Beedrill; whereas many other Pokémon evolve into their final forms at much later levels, Beedrill`s early availability makes it a temporarily strong asset to Pokémon Trainers starting out on their journeys. Beedrill are extremely territorial, and will be set off by anything that approaches a Beedrill nest. When angered, Beedrill attack in a furious swarm, and the sharp ends of their stingers and the poison stored in their abdomens will definitely be put to use.</description>

<description>Pidgey, known as the Tiny Bird Pokémon, is a bird-like Pokémon, whose original name in the English beta version of Pokémon Red and Blue was "Pidge". Pidgey was first introduced in the United States in Red and Blue. They are one of the first wild Pokémon that players encounter in those games. Pidgey does not like to fight, and will use its wings to stir up clouds of sand in an attempt to distract its would-be opponent and escape. Pidgey also uses this technique to bring its preferred prey of small insects into the open. Pidgey seems to possess magnetoception, as it is capable of returning to its nest from any location without fail.
Pidgey also appeared in the first television episode, Pokémon, I Choose You!, when the main character, Ash Ketchum, attempts to catch one. He fails when it uses its Gust attack to blow him away and escapes. Afterwards, it uses its Sand Attack to blind Ash, allowing it to get away.</description>

<description>Spearow is a small, bird Pokémon with short wings and a small, stubby beak. It is noted for being frail, but it makes up for that with its "Mirror Move" ability. It eats insects in grassy areas by flushing them out with its wings, and plucking at them with its beak. Its wings aren`t good for long distance travel or high flying, but it is able to fly at high speeds by flapping its wings very rapidly. It is very territorial, constantly buzzing about and calling with a loud cry that can be heard from half a mile away. It serves to scare away predators and keep in touch with other Spearow, which usually is used to alert them of danger. The golden spearow has golden wings and a golden beak, it also has a lighter color of brown feathers.</description>

<description>Vulpix is a fox-like creature with six curled tails, based on the Japanese fox spirit kitsune. Most commonly female, Vulpix are especially known for being beautiful. As Vulpix undergo Pokemon evolution, their red fur turns pale yellow and they grow three extra tails. Vulpix usually have a friendly, if not spoiled, temperament. Because of the flame in their bodies, when the temperature outside increases, they let flames out of their mouths to prevent their body temperature from getting too hot. In the wild, Vulpix will feign injury to escape from more powerful predators.
During the first season of the Pokemon anime, Vulpix appears often as one of Brock`s Pokemon. It was given to him by a girl named Susie who felt she could not take care of it well. Brock, who felt he was only "babysitting", gives it back to Susie in the season four episode called "Beauty and the Breeder".
Its Japanese name, Rokon is a portmanteau of six (六, roku) and kon (from kon kon, an onomatopoeic word describing the bark of a fox), or an alternate reading of the Japanese word for kitsune (狐, kitsune), meaning fox - in this case, the reading is ko (こ). Its English name may have been derived from the scientific name for a group of foxes, Vulpes.</description>

<description>Oddish are a weed-like Pokémon found in all regions throughout the Pokémon world. (with the exception of Pokémon Blue and Pokémon Leaf Green) Oddish looks like a small animated onion/turnip plant with a rounded body. Its body is blue or purple with two small feet and red eyes. On top of its head grows a large clump of 5 long green blades of grass. Its name likely came from the words "odd" and "radish".
Oddish is a nocturnal Pokémon, using moonlight rather than the sun`s rays for photosynthesis. During the day, Oddish avoids the sun`s heat and brightness by burying itself into the earth, leaving only the leaves on top of its head visible above ground. In this way it disguises itself as a plant, misdirecting its carnivorous diurnal predators.
While buried, Oddish nourishes itself by absorbing nutrients from the soil using its feet, which are said to temporarily change into a root-like structure for this purpose.
Oddish has been known to use its leaves as hands, such as one who used this to climb a rope net and tried to fly like a Hoppip.
If anyone pulls at Oddish`s leaves and tries to uproot it while it is buried underground, Oddish will react by shrieking in a cute, high-pitched voice. This mirrors the behavior of the legendary mandrake in a similar situation, although it seems that Oddish`s squeaks do not have the same dire consequences as a mandrake`s.</description>

<description>Diglett is a basic mole-like creature that can be found only in Diglett`s Cave. Capable of burrowing at the speed of sound, it thrives in dark underground caves since exposure to bright light can weaken it. The burrow and excretions left by a Diglett, rather like those of a real-life earthworm, keep the soil aerated and fertile. For this reason, Diglett are prized by farmers.
The mysterious feet or hands of Diglett are unknown of what they look like, for the fact that Diglett can use moves such as slash and fury swipes. Only the head of a Diglett can be seen popping out of the ground.</description>

<description>Golduck are large bipedal ducks, with blue skin and strong, webbed appendages that given them the ability to swim at high speeds. Due to their bluish color and webbed hands and feet, Golduck are sometimes mistaken for Kappa. They have more formidable psychic powers than the Psyduck they evolve from, and they lose the headaches that they constantly suffer from. The gem on their heads glows when they use psychic powers as well as when they swim at full speed.
They live in fresh-water lakes and rivers, where they are seen gracefully swimming, especially at dusk. As the fastest swimmers out of all Pokémon, they can out swim even the most athletic of humans, though they often train with swimmers. As they are able to swim in severe storms, they are sometimes found rescuing people lost at sea from danger.</description>

<description>Geodude has a rock for a head, no nose, and two long arms that start with a bulging muscle and end with rock hands resembling a human`s. Geodude most frequently are found in fields and on mountains. People step or trip on them from time to time, mistaking them for rocks. Its arms are so strong that it can use them to climb mountains. Rhyperior sometimes accidentally shoot Geodude from their cannon-like arms. Geodudes are one of the few Pokémon to have appeared in every Pokémon game.
In the video games, Geodude is commonly found inside caves and mountains, and sometimes appears when Rock Smash is used. Geodude are also found in the Nintendo 64 game Pokémon Snap, hanging from mountainsides by their arms. In the Super Smash Bros. Melee battlefield "Poké Floats", a Geodude is the last float the fighters ride on before returning to the Squirtle float.
Geodude is a recurring character in the Pokémon anime. It first appeared in the fifth episode, "Showdown in Pewter City," used by Gym Leader Brock to battle Ash. Brock became a travel companion of Ash and owned Geodude for the first five seasons. Navel Island Gym Leader Danny and Rustboro City Gym Leader Roxanne have also used Geodude. In the anime, Geodude is able to levitate above the ground.
Geodude`s name comes from the word "Geode" as in a rock with a sparkly inside, and "Dude," usually used to describe a certain kind of male person.</description>

<description>Graveler resembles a large boulder with four arms and two legs. It lives and feeds on rocky mountains. It will climb the slope of a mountain daily, snacking on small rocks along the way, and roll back down once it has reached the peak. Though it is not very fast when walking, a Graveler rolling down a mountain trail is a very dangerous thing to encounter. Carefree by nature, Graveler ignores most obstacles that may appear in its path, such as grass, trees, boulders or even hikers, since it can roll through or over them more often than not. It is not essentially harmed rolling down the slope, even if the odd jutting piece of its body gets broken off. Machop are known to use Graveler as training weights.</description>

<description>Golem is a megaton Pokémon made from living stone, and one of the heaviest of all Pokémon species. Golem inhabits rocky mountains and volcanoes, often disguising itself as an inanimate boulder. It will annually shed its skin like a reptile, with its new shell often being bigger than the one before. Its body is almost impenetrable, able to withstand dynamite blasts; it can even detonate its own body, launching itself great distances in order to travel from mountain to mountain. When earthquakes occur near where Golem live, they will tumble down mountains, rolling at an incredible speed.
In the video games, the only way to obtain Golem is to evolve a Graveler by trading it to another player.
Golem has made numerous appearances in the Pokémon anime. It first appeared in the episode "The Bridge Bike Gang," in which Chopper, the leader of a bicycle gang, uses one to battle Ash`s Charmander.
Golem`s name comes from the word "golem," which is a humanoid clay or stone statue associated with Jewish mysticism.</description>

<description>Rapidash is a Fire-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Ponyta starting at level 40.
In Galar, Rapidash has a Psychic/Fairy-type regional form. It evolves from Galarian Ponyta starting at level 40.
Rapidash is an equine Pokémon with cream-colored fur and a pointed horn on its forehead. It has small, red eyes and triangular ears with reddish interiors. Yellow and reddish-orange flames stream from the back of its head to form a long, flowing mane. A short version of the mane trails down its back to its equally fiery tail. Flames are also present on its fetlocks. It has slender legs, each with a single black hoof.
Rapidash is a very agile Pokémon. It runs at about 150 mph (240 km/h), chasing everything that moves in hopes of racing it. With incredible acceleration, it reaches its top speed in only ten steps. At full gallop, its hooves barely touch the ground. The faster Rapidash goes, the longer the swaying flames of its mane will become. At an all-out gallop, its blazing mane sparkles, a feature which is said to enhance its beautiful appearance. Rapidash lives in grasslands, but it can also be seen on mountains in Pokémon Snap.</description>

Its name a portmanteau of slow (as in "slow-witted") and bro (as in "brother", probably relating to the fraternal relationship it shares with the Shellder on its tail). Slowpoke becomes Slowbro when a Shellder clamps down on its tail, yet it is so slow and dopey it is sometimes unaware of the change until it gets out of the water. Its Japanese name is most likely derived from 宿借り yadokari (hermit crab). The Shellder which bites on its tail sucks on the aforementioned syrup, and so it is hard to remove. Also toxins which leak from the bite pass into Slowbro, which numbs its immunity to pain even more. The relationship between Slowpoke and Shellder is symbiotic; being attached to the Slowpoke enables the Shellder to travel on land, whereas the weight of the Shellder on its tail enables the Slowpoke to walk on its hind legs, freeing the use of its arms.</description>

<description>Dewgong`s name is derived from the real animal which has a similar, but much larger, body: the dugong. In the beta versions of Red/Blue, Dewgong`s name was originally going to be Manaty, a reference to the manatee. The Pokémon first appears in the arsenal of a trainer named "Allison" outside of Saffron City, who cites her similar body fat percentage as a reason for her choosing to utilize the Water/Ice type Pokémon.</description>

<description>Gengar is a dual-type Ghost/Poison Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Haunter when traded. It is the final form of Gastly. It can Mega Evolve into Mega Gengar using the Gengarite. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Gengar is a dark purple, bipedal Pokémon with a roundish body. It has red eyes, a wide mouth that is usually curled into a sinister grin, and pointed ears. On its back are numerous spikes and it has smaller spikes on top of its head similar to tufty fur. Its arms and legs are short with three digits on both its hands and feet. It also has a stubby tail.
Gengar has the ability to hide perfectly in the shadow of any object, granting it exceptional stealth. However, Gengar`s body acts as a heat sink. Its presence cools the temperature of the surrounding area by nearly 10°F (5°C), because it absorbs the warmth. The anime has shown that Gengar can fly and possess people and other Pokémon. In the past, Night Shade was its signature move.
Gengar is very mischievous, and at times, malicious. It enjoys playing practical jokes and casting curses, such as pretending to be one`s shadow, then behaving erratically. When the quarry notices, the Gengar takes delight in its victim`s terror. However, Gengar has been known to be loyal to a Trainer who treats it well. Being the result of an evolution via trading, Gengar is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in caves and dark places where shadows form. It is especially fond of urban areas such as cities and back alleys, but only during the night.
As Mega Gengar, a portion of its body sinks into the ground and its arms and tail lengthen. The lower portions turn a more reddish purple, and a third eye appears on its forehead. This new unblinking eye is oval, yellow, and allows it to see into other dimensions. The spikes on Mega Gengar`s back are more numerous and pointed and additional spikes appear on its hands and tail. Its ears are now considerably longer and tilt backward.
Mega Gengar has the ability to access other dimensions and has a vicious nature. Mega Gengar has no itnerests in opponents unless perceived as prey. Its relationships are warped due to Mega Evolution. It now desires to take the life and curse anyone or anything in its path It may even curse its own Trainer. Mega Gengar sinks into an another dimension to wait for a chance to attack.
As Gigantamax Genger, it becomes larger with portions of its body sinking into ground. Only the head, tail, and arms remain. Also it changes to from a dark purple to lighter purple. The eyes change to the color white with yellow sclera. The inside of the mouth changes to resemble a tunnel with a long purple tounge sticking out. Three red clouds surrounds the top of Gengar’s head.
There’s a rumor where Gigantamax Gengar’s mouth does not lead into its body. Due the cursed energy, it’s believed to instead lead into the afterlife. By laying a trap, it hope to steal the lives of those it captures. Should someone stand near its mouth, they can hear the voices of their loved ones calling out to them.
Gigantamax Gengar is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Terror.</description>

<description>Onix is a subterranean creature that bores its way through the ground at a rate of 50 mph (80 km/h) in search of food. The tunnels it leaves behind as it burrows through the earth are used as pre-dug homes by other subterranean Pokémon such as Diglett and Geodude. Within Onyx`s member is a structure nigh identical to a magnet, which allows it to determine its heading, its depth underground, and other such information useful for a subterranean Pokémon to know. It acts quite like a compass. As Onix ages, it burrows deeper underground, and its rocky member becomes progressively harder, rounder, and smoother. Around the age of 100, the pressures exerted on its stone member become so high that it is compressed into a much harder, diamond-like composition, although it is closer to metal in nature.
In the anime, an Onix is owned by Brock as part of the many Pokemon owned by the training gym that Brock`s family runs. Brock had initially received the Onix from his father, who is a specialist in rock-type Pokemon. When Brock feels the need to travel with Ash Ketchum yet again, he entrusts the care of the Onix to one of his many younger brothers. This takes place in Pokémon Chronicles. It eventually evolves into a Steelix.</description>

<description>Voltorb are aggressive red and white ball shaped Pokémon that looks strikingly similar to a Poké Ball. Coincidently it was discovered shortly after Poké Balls were invented, some believe there is a connection. Though roughly ten times larger, many trainers get a surprise when they pick one up thinking it is a Poké Ball. The strength of their explosions is dependent on how much electricity they store in their bodies. When jarred or angered, a Voltorb can and will explode, causing massive damage to their aggressor and themselves (as seen in the video games when they use the moves `Self-Destruct` or `Explosion`, both of which causes fainting to the user). It is so unstable that even the slightest bump in the road will make it explode spontaneously. Voltorb do not have a mouth, but do have two eyes that are normally slanted into an aggressive or angry stare.</description>

<description>Electrode is a red and white ball shaped Pokémon that looks strikingly similar to a Pokéball with its colors reversed (white on top and red on bottom instead of red on top and white on bottom, like Voltorb). They are known to explode at the slightest shock and without warning. Electrodes feed on and stores electricity from power plants and lightning storms, but rarely do they use it to attack foes. It instead uses its stored electric to increase its rolling speed. The amount of electricity in an Electrode is relative to how powerful its explosions are. The stored energy also generates strong static electricity around Electrode`s body, sometimes paralyzing enemies on contact. If it is bored, it often amuses itself by exploding. Electrode has two beady eyes and an almost nonstop grin.</description>

<description>Weezing is a Poison-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Koffing starting at level 35.
In Galar, Weezing has a Poison/Fairy-type regional form. It evolves from Koffing starting at level 35. All Koffing in Galar evolve into this form regardless of their origin.
Weezing is a purple Pokémon consisting of two spherical heads connected by a thin tube with another sphere in the center. The heads have differing sizes and features. The left head is larger and has prominent eyebrows, pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw, and two flat teeth in its upper jaw. The smaller, right head simply has two pointed teeth, one at each corner of its mouth. The larger head has a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking below its face, while the smaller head has a ring marking instead. It is covered with many geyser-like protrusions, which usually expel mustard-colored gases. Weezing is said to form when poisonous gases pool and two Koffing fuse over many years. Very rarely, two Koffing can become a Weezing in a short timespan because of a sudden mutation. Triplet Weezing have been discovered, although they are extremely rare.
Each of Weezing`s heads contains a different toxin. It mixes its gases by inflating one head and deflating the other. When its gases mix, Weezing becomes more toxic and putrid. Weezing can hover in midair, presumably due to gases lighter than air, as is the case for Koffing. Despite their stench and poison, Weezing`s gases can be used to make top-grade perfume by diluting them to the highest level.
Weezing lives in urban areas. It seeks a dirty, unkempt house and nests there. At night, when the people in the house are asleep, it will go through the trash. Weezing feeds on the dust, microorganisms, and especially gases emitted by garbage and toxic waste. Weezing`s body expands and smells worse upon inhaling poisonous gases. The Kantoian Weezing used to be common in Galar and created more potent toxins than their Galarian relatives.
In the Galar region, its appearance has changed due to absorbing polluted air from factories. It has a grey body with with the skull, crossbones, and ring changed to color yellow. Both heads have a hat-like tube located on top of them that constantly release purified air. Five green puffs of poison gas clouds can be seen floating around it. The larger head has a cloud-like mustache, while the smaller has clouds on its face in the shape of eyebrows and a beard.
Galrian Weezing consumes particles from the polluted air. It expels clean air instead of droppings. The toxins within Weezing`s body are accumulated into poison gas clouds that leaks and drifts around it. The gas is Weezing`s best weapon in battle, being potent enough to stun and immobilize an opponent with just a whiff.
Galarian Weezing is the only known Pokémon capable of using the the move Strange Steam.</description>

<description>Rhyhorn is a rhinoceros like Pokemon with a rock like hide consisting of plates. Ryhorn stands on all four legs and evolves into Rhydon. Rhyhorn is a portmanteau of rhinoceros (which it resembles) and horn. Its spelling is also influenced by the rock rhyolite. Its Japanese name is a portmanteau of sai (犀), meaning rhinoceros and horn (ホーン). Rhyhorn are easily angered and will not hesitate to charge at what ever or who ever angered it. Rhyhorn are powerful enough to topple buildings with their tackle. Rhyhorn are prime examples of "more brawn than brains", as they often charge head first into things but forget why. In Gold, Silver, and Crystal, Brock uses a Rhyhorn to battle. There is also a Rhyhorn in the Brock Gym Leader set of the trading card game.</description>

<description>Starmie is an aquatic starfish Pokémon that evolves from Staryu through use of a Water Stone. It moves through the water by spinning its star-shaped body in a manner like that of a propeller. It consists of two five-point, purple star-shaped structures superimposed on top of each other. At its center is a large gem, surrounded by a golden crest like structure. Starmie`s center section - the gem - is known as its "core". This gem is considered very valuable among collectors. The gem`s hue can change to any color in the visual spectrum, earning Starmie the nickname "the gem of the sea". When Starmie is weak, the core grows dim and starts flickering whilst producing distinctive warning sounds.
In the Pokémon world, the aforementioned peculiar properties of Starmie`s anatomy leads some people to theorize that Starmie`s origins are not of this planet, and that its luminescent core is used to send electromagnetic signals into outer space. It may have some connection with Deoxys having a similar core and the ability to regenerate. In ancient times, Starmie was attributed an equally mystical origin: that it was created from the reflection of the stars upon the waves at night.
In the anime, Starmie is one of the Pokémon used in Misty`s team during the most of the Kanto arc, along with its pre-evolved form, Staryu. Misty also often used Starmie outside of battle for transportation through water or for fire-fighting purposes. Misty eventually left Starmie in the care of her sisters at the Cerulean City Gym, and later reobtained it upon her return.</description>

<description>Scyther is a mantis Pokémon. Its English name was originally going to be Stryke, as revealed in the 1999 Nintendo Official Magazine Pokémon Special #2. Scyther`s most impressive feature is its scythe-like arms that can easily cut through metal. Scyther is also noted for its agility. While hunting in the wild or in a battle between trainers, it relies on its speed to strike quickly and to avoid being struck in return by its foe. Its high-supernatural speed can make it seem to be in more than one place at once, or to seem invisible as it moves in, strikes, and leaves the opponent before he can feel the blow. Scyther`s wings are capable of flight, but this is rare; it is not a fast or an agile flier, and it is a better hunter on its own feet.
In the anime, Tracey Sketchit catches a Scyther in the Orange Islands. It is aged and was recently removed from its clan by a younger, stronger Scyther. The bug Pokémon reconcile their differences through the interference of Team Rocket, and Tracey`s Scyther is allowed to leave with him with its conflicts fully resolved. Tracey`s Scyther is incredibly strong-willed, preferring to keep watch over the travellers while they sleep, as opposed to staying in its Poké Ball.
In the episode "Showdown at Dark City", two gangs were fighting in a dusty town. The leader of one team had an Electabuzz while the other had a Scyther. When Ash poured ketchup barrels on both Pokémon, they locked into each other in a death grip, meaning that Scyther and Electabuzz are possibly provoked by the color red.</description>

<description>Magikarp is a commonly found Pokémon that can survive in rivers, lakes,and oceans. Despite its adaptability, the Pokédex states that the Magikarp species has grown weaker over time, and it is one of the least viable for battling in the series. It eventually evolves into another, far more powerful Pokémon, Gyarados.
Magikarp is commonly thought of as the weakest Pokémon. They are only able to learn three moves: Splash (does absolutely nothing), Tackle (a weak attack), and Flail (which does more damage as Magikarp is more damaged.)
In the anime, Magikarp has appeared several times, most notably as the subject of a running gag in which a salesman attempts to trick Team Rocket into buying Magikarp in various guises. (This man also appears in Pokémon Red, Blue, Yellow, FireRed, and LeafGreen.) Team Rocket later adopted a Magikarp-shaped submarine.
Magikarp also appear many times in the video games. They can be found in almost any pond, river, lake, or sea. Many trainers have them, along with other weak Water Pokémon like Goldeen or Horsea. In Pokémon Pearl, one trainer named "Ander," found outside Lake Valor, possesses a Magikarp whose move "Quake" replaces the normal Magikarp`s equally useless "Splash".</description>

<description>Lapras is a dual-type Water/Ice Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, it has a Gigantamax form.
Lapras is a large sea Pokémon that resembles a plesiosaur. It has a blue hide with darker blue spots and a cream-colored underside. It has large brown eyes, a short horn on its forehead, and tightly curled ears. It has a long neck and four flippers. The foremost flippers are larger than the hind. On its back is a heavy, gray shell covered in blunt knobs.
Lapras is a gentle, helpful Pokémon that enjoys ferrying people across bodies of water. In the past, its docility made it an easy target for hunters, and it was driven to near-extinction. Recent protection efforts have seen Lapras become overabundant instead, which is now affecting the fish Pokémon numbers in some areas. An intelligent Pokémon, it is able to understand human speech. Lapras have been known to travel in large pods across the seas, spanning both polar and tropical areas. To keep in touch with other of its kind, it sings enchanting melodies. In the anime it was shown that Lapras is able to develop psychic abilities such as telepathy.
As Gigantamax Lapras, it becomes larger in size and more armored. Its shell resembles a cruise ship with four gray and red stripes surrounding it, and it has four spikes on top of its shell with one steel spike resembling a funnel, which has three red clouds surrounding it. The sclera in Lapras` eyes change colors to white, yellow, and blue. A light blue ring of fine thin lines resembling a musical sheet created from ice particles circles around its shell.
5,000 people can ride on the shell of Gigantamax Lapras for a very comfortable ride without any issues. Lapras can use it giant ring to break any icebergs that may prevent it from swimming.
Gigantamax Lapras is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Resonance.</description>

<description>Vaporeon is one of the evolutions of Eevee that is caused by radiation from a water stone. Upon evolving, it gains fins and gills that give it the ability to live underwater. It has small scales that are hard to see. Its finned tail is similar to a mermaid`s, so it is often mistaken for one. Vaporeon`s cells are similar in structure to water molecules, and this allows it to have a unique control over the water around it. This includes being able to transform itself into liquid as a form of camouflage (this being portrayed in the games as its ability to learn the attack Acid Armor), and detect rain through subtle vibrations in its fins. Its base scale color is aqua with darker aqua that makes a line along the spine from the tail to the neck where it forms into a base for its white frill. A darker-aqua patch on the head is similar in shape to a diving cap, and upon the head are three yellow fins, two resembling ears, and the middle one, a Dorsal fin. Its ability is `Water Absorb`, which allows it to gain HP when struck with a water type move.</description>

<description>Porygon is the first man-made Pokemon, the product of extensive research by Silph Co. It consists entirely of programming code, allowing it to convert itself entirely back to program data. This allows it to move freely in cyberspace. This code is copy protected in order to prevent duplication. This code is fairly restrictive, limiting Porygon to certain pre-programmed motions, actions, and reactions. As it does not need to breathe, it is used in various environments, even some normally considered inhospitable.
In the Pokemon world, Porygon is only available as a prize from slot machines. As a result, a large number of people have taken to playing the slots seeking to win a Porygon. These gamblers are especially visible in the towns of Kanto and Johto. Porygon are not available in Hoenn at all. However, Porygon actually run wild in Sinnoh. Porygon is cheaper to obtain in some Pokémon versions than in others.
Porygon`s most significant appearance in the Pokemon Anime to date is Dennou Senshi Porygon, an episode notorious for having caused hundreds of children to have epileptic seizures during its broadcast in Japan. Even though Pikachu caused the `seizure attack`, it was Porygon (and its evolved forms) who were banned from the Pokemon anime. Aside from that, Porygon has had only a few minor cameo appearances.</description>

<description>Kabutops is the evolved form of Kabuto. It lives in the water, and can move at high speeds by folding its limbs against its body. The creature comes out of the water to hunt. Kabutops is a predator, but its nature of feeding is vampiric; instead of killing its prey, it uses its razor sharp claws to open wounds in its prey, and then drink its blood. It attempts to avoid killing prey, so it may feed at a later date. Kabutops is loosely based on trilobites as a counterpoint to Omanyte and Omastar representing ammonites. This can clearly be seen with the enlarged cephalon and the pygidium and thoracic spines. It was introduced in Pokémon Red and Blue, where the player-character plays a part in reviving the assumed-extinct species by giving a Fossil to the Scientist on Cinnabar Island.</description>

It captures its prey with its talons and brings it to its nest. However, if the prey resists, it may use its razor-sharp teeth to immobilize it. When attacking its enemies or opponents, it goes for the throat with its saw like fangs. Aerodactyl is heavy and rough-skinned, leading to the development of strong wings.</description>

A Chinchou`s eyes are yellow and their pupils have the shape of plus signs. When blinking or closing its eyes, only the vertical parts close, making the pupils look like minus signs. Its habitat is the dark depths of the ocean floor. In the absence of any other light, Chinchou sees its surroundings and communicates by shooting positive and negative charged electricity particles between the tips of its antennae, creating an electric current and thus light. This can be said to be a form of bioluminescence. The charges Chinchou shoots between its antennae can also be used offensively, to stun its opponents with a flash of light or shock them with electricity.</description>

It uses this light to attract and blind prey, and then swallow the immobilized prey in a single gulp. The light is also useful for Lanturn to navigate through the deep, murky waters. The light from its antenna is produced by bacterial symbiosis. Bioluminescent bacteria in Lanturn`s antenna cause a chemical reaction with Lanturn`s bodily fluids to create the bright light.</description>

<description>Natu are very small, spherical, green birds with underdeveloped, textured wings, red talons, red tail feathers, and a red plume on each of their foreheads. Since their wings are not fully grown, Natu are unable to fly and therefore must hop around in order to get around. As a result of this, however, Natu`s jumping abilities are quite developed and they can hop great distances. They are diurnal herbivores that live in savanna areas. They forage for food on the ground by custom, but when a lack of food on the ground is apparent, Natu turn to the trees that grow in the savannas. With their strong jumping ability in their talons, Natu may either charge forward and quite literally run up the trunk of a small tree to reach a branch or use both their legs and their flapping wings to propel themselves onto higher tree branches well over seven feet off the ground. Once there, they peck at and feed on the tree`s recently grown shoots.
Natu have a peculiar nature in observing. Whenever they are seen, they always appear to be looking at something intently in particular. When a human makes eye contact with a Natu, the Pokemon will unfailingly stare back intently at him or her without hopping to safety, even though humans in comparison should be intimidatingly large. However, if that human moves even slightly, the Natu will suddenly hop away to safety.</description>

It will also meditate from morning to sunset without moving. Xatu is said to be overwhelmed by the visual feedback of seeing two different time periods at once, or in terror at seeing the perils the future holds.

<description>Azumarill is the evolved form of Marill. Azumarill resembles a blue, bipedal rabbit with a large, ellipsoid body, long blue ears with red insides, and a blue ball on the end of its thin, elastic black tail. The white bubble-like pattern on its lower stomach helps it to camouflage itself from potential predators when it is in the water.
Azumarill`s long ears act as sensors to identify sounds even in fast running rivers. Otherwise, when alone, Azumarill plays in water as a natural pastime, though it must roll up its elongated ears to prevent the sensitive sensory materials inside them from getting wet. The ball at the end of its tail can act as a sensor and guide it while under water. It can make thick, liquid balloons out of thin air with the saliva-water stored in its body. If it spots a drowning Pokémon in any body of water, it fashions such air balloons and jumps in to give the troubled Pokémon air balloons to help it breathe.
In the Pokémon anime, Paul owned an Azumarill which he used in a gym battle against Roark. Although it knew powerful Water attacks like Hydro Pump, it lost to Roark`s Geodude, which prompted Paul to give it to a Pokémon trainer passing by, being disappointed by its strength.</description>

<description>Aipom resembles a purple squirrel monkey with its face forever frozen in a maniacal grin that can be described as rictus and a blank stare from its round eyes. On its thin tail is a three fingered hand-like appendage that is very dexterous. It provides both propulsion and balance while Aipom leaps from tree to tree. Aipom is not aggressive by nature and will attempt to tire its natural opponents through dexterous dodging of the opponent`s attacks in hope that the enemy will be discouraged and leave. Otherwise, if the enemy is persistent, the Aipom will try to retreat, but if it is unable to, it will attack by diving at its opponent from the trees.
In the anime, an Aipom steals Ash`s hat, and follows his group around until Ash battles and captures it. Ash`s Aipom is quite attached to him, getting incredibly jealous when it sees Pikachu on Ash`s shoulder. Aipom has the distinction of being the only Pokemon aside from Pikachu that Ash brought with him to Sinnoh, although inadvertently. Aipom seems to enjoy contests, and Dawn believes it prefers contests over battles. In "Throwing the Track Switch!", Ash trades Aipom for Dawn`s Buizel because both Pokemon seemed more interested in the other trainer`s training. In "Journey to the Unknown", Dawn`s Aipom evolves into Ambipom.</description>

<description>Yanma physically resembles a dragonfly. It has a large green head on a long red thorax, six legs and two pairs of wings. Its head has a pair of segmented eyes and two red spikes on top. Yanma has extremely well-developed wing muscles; in fact, they can generate enough force to break glass by means of the resulting shockwave. Frightened Yanma have been recorded as breaking the sound barrier. Yanma is aided when hunting by its prodigious flying ability; it navigates so perfectly that it can abruptly change direction in mid-flight without slowing down. It can evolve into a Yanmega.</description>

<description>Wooper are similar to Axolotl. They are light teal-colored Pokémon with round feet, no arms, and a long tail. Their simplistic face consists of mainly of a large mouth, primarily while open. They have purplish barbed antennae on the sides of their head. Three purple, though sometimes shaded blue or pink, gills are on its stomach. Wooper will usually live in cold water: however, they occasionally come out onto land in search of food. When doing so, they coat their bodies with slimy, poisonous film. Touching the slime with bare hands will cause a shooting pain. Male Wooper have two barbs on their antennae, while female Wooper have one barb. Males also have larger gills.</description>

<description>Murkrow is a small black crow with red eyes. The top of its head is styled as a witch`s hat and its tail bristles out like a broomstick. Murkrow is rather unpopular in the Pokémon world. Its dismal appearance and nocturnal nature have long caused it to be considered an omen of ill fortune to all who see it. If a Murkrow finds itself wounded, it fights back by leading its pursuer to dark mountain trails in an attempt to get him hopelessly lost in the darkness.
Murkrow is also attracted to bright, shiny objects, which it collects to stash in its nest. This, of course, leads to many arguments between Murkrow and Meowth, who both share a common love of stashing things - and taking from each other! It does not hesitate to steal such objects if necessary and has even been known to attempt to snatch rings off their owner`s fingers (and complete strangers too, for that matter). With the addition of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, it is revealed that some Murkrow are servants to its evolved form, Honchkrow, who spends all of its time preening and ordering the Murkrow around. Also with Diamond and Pearl`s release, Murkrow, like many other Pokémon, have gender differences. In this case, Males have a taller "hat" - technically, the crest that resembles a three-pointed witch hat - than females would. Murkrow can only be found wild in the Pokémon Diamond Version in Eterna Forest, while Misdreavus can only be found in Pokémon Pearl at the same location.</description>

<description>Qwilfish is a porcupinefish-like fish that has a round body with many toxin-containing spikes and a teardrop-shaped tail. The spikes give it trouble swimming, but it also has defensive measures against predators. Qwilfish can swallow large quantities of water in very short notice, causing itself to inflate to a much larger size, which it uses to intimidate larger opponents. If the opponent isn`t scared, Qwilfish uses the pressure of the water it swallowed to shoot out its toxic spikes at, thus weakening, the opponent.</description>

<description>Remoraid is a Remora-based suckerfish that scavenges for food and has a somewhat symbiotic relationship with Mantine. Remoraid will attach itself to the underbelly of Mantine with its dorsal fin, eating scraps of food that Mantine drops as well as the parasites on them that causes them to itch. In return, the Mantine helps defend the Remoraid from enemies. When not scavenging for food, Remoraid will strike down its own prey with precise accuracy using fast streams of airborne water, which Remoraid shoots from its mouth using abdominal muscles. Remoraid can move faster through the water by blasting water from its mouth in the opposite direction of where it intends to move.</description>

<description>Mantine is a dark blue manta ray with two large wings branching off its body. It is often depicted having a Remoraid attached to its side eating Mantine`s leftovers. In the anime, Mantine protects Remoraid`s offspring, while the parent Remoraid help the Mantine in tough decisions. Mantine swims in open sea, participating in schools. Its large and well-developed wings enable it to briefly leap over the sea`s surface if it builds up enough speed, in a manner similar to some real aquatic species. Mantine is a filter feeder, like whales; its diet consists of most things that happen to enter its mouth while swimming.</description>

<description>Sealeo lives in herds among the ice floes of Arctic regions, and these herds consist of both itself and its other evolutionary forms Spheal and Walrein. Its flippers are quite powerful: they are strong enough to shatter ice with well-placed flaps. Five times a day, Sealeo dives into the sea to hunt prey.
Sealeo`s behavior revolves mostly around its sensitive nose; Sealeo uses it to investigate new things. It lifts new objects up with its nose, and rolls them around. While rolling an object, Sealeo checks the object`s aroma and texture in order to learn about it. This is what it does to differentiate food from anything else, making it a vital ability for survival. However, Sealeo also takes a liking to balancing and spinning a younger Spheal on its nose for entertainment.</description>

<name>Latias</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Latias is the female Eon Pokémon from the Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald series of games and is one of a duo of Psychic/Dragon-type Pokémon, the other being Latios. These two are the only legendary Pokémon in the games that have genders (other than Heatran and Cresselia, which first appear in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.)
Latias is a red-and-white dragon Pokémon with small arms and feet, and spiky wings on her back. She has triangle-shaped blue markings on her belly that are similar to those of a Togepi. She is able to use a form of active camouflage by enfolding her body with her glass-like coat of down and refracting light in unique ways, allowing her to become invisible or even take on the appearance of a human.
Latias is highly sensitive to the emotions of people and can telepathically communicate with them. She rarely makes contact with people or other Pokémon. If Latias senses any hostility, she ruffles the feathers all over her body and cries shrilly to intimidate her foe. Like Latios, Latias is highly intelligent. Latias has been occasionally sighted in small herds of several members, although she is unable to breed in the video games.
Latias`s only anime appearance was in the fifth Pokémon anime film, Pokémon Heroes. Latias also appears in the non-Pokémon-exclusive video game Super Smash Bros. Brawl appearing in tandem with Latios as Pokémon appearing from Poké Ball items.
Latias can be found in Pokémon Sapphire after completing the Pokémon League. She is found on a random-encounter basis, similar to that of Raikou, Entei, and Suicune in Gold, Silver, and Crystal. She can also be found in Emerald after completing the Pokémon League, but in Emerald, the player`s mother tells him or her to watch a TV news story, which explains that a Pokémon (its name cannot be heard) has been seen. This gives the player a choice of capturing either Latias or Latios. Latias can also be obtained via the Eon Ticket, given to the player after attending a Nintendo promotional event for Pokémon Ruby.</description>

<description>Latios is the male Eon Pokémon. They are a blue and white, dragon-like, legendary Pokémon with small arms and feet, and spiky fighter aircraft-like wings on their back. They appear to have white flesh underneath their blue carapace. They appear extremely similar to Latias, only blue, and more angular. It is said that by folding their arms close to their body, they can fly faster than a jet. Latios are all male.
Latios` intelligence allows them to understand human languages. They have a docile temperament and dislike fighting. A Latios will only open his heart to a trainer with a compassionate spirit. Their signature attack, Luster Purge, may reduce the target`s special defense. Like Latias, Latios can also render themselves invisible.
Latios, along with Latias, have a starring role in the movie Pokémon Heroes as guardians of Altomare, a city modeled after Venice, Italy. At the end of the film, Latios sacrifices himself to protect Altomare from a tremendous tsunami. It is notable that Latios marks the first actual Pokémon death in the anime series so far (the imaginary Entei and Celebi do not count). This may have been the fact that Latios is based on Jesus in characteristics.</description>

<description>Team Rocket is a highly organized criminal syndicate "in pursuit of evil" headed by Giovanni (called "The Boss" by his underlings) and based in Kanto. Its main focus is in stealing or capturing, then selling, rare and/or strong Pokemon, but it also conducts cruel experimental research on Pokemon. According to the Generation II games, the Team Rocket Oath says: "Steal Pokemon for profit. Exploit Pokemon for profit. All Pokemon exist for the glory of Team Rocket." Team Rocket`s final goal is to take over the world using Pokemon.
In the anime, Team Rocket is based in Kanto, with many smaller branches reaching out in Kanto and Johto. Giovanni is the Gym Leader of Viridian City during the early part of Ash`s journey. There is also an underground school for training aspiring Team Rocket members. In addition, Team Rocket had its headquarters near Pallet Town and Viridian City, but this was destroyed by Mewtwo in its rage; it is unknown where the headquarters are now. All that is known is that the headquarters are now in a large building built at the end of a canyon and guarded by many grunts, seen when Jessie, James, and Meowth returned from the Hoenn region to report back to Giovanni.</description>

<description>Jessie is one half of of the Team Rocket duo that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokemon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
Jessie`s mother, Miyamoto, was a high-ranking Team Rocket agent. When Jessie was around the age of three, Miyamoto left on a mission to the Andes Mountains to record the voice of the elusive Pokemon Mew. However, Miyamoto disappeared, and Jessie was put into a foster home which had very little money. There were times when she had no choice but to eat snow because of a lack of more nourishing food.
When she was old enough, she left home to become a Pokemon nurse in Jouto. However, the school she was enrolled in was literally for Pokemon nurses (i.e. Chansey), so she failed to graduate and left, leaving behind a Chansey she had befriended there. It is assumed that she then traveled back to Kanto, where she enrolled in Pokemon Tech, a trainer`s school, met James, and subsequently failed and dropped out. After this, Jessie and James joined a bicycle gang in Sunny Town, where Jessie was known for swinging a chain above her head as she rode her bike (nicknamed "Chainer Jess").
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between Jessie and James after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Sometime before joining Team Rocket, and it is not known when, Jessie obtained a Contest Pass in the Hoenn region. Also during the years before Team Rocket, she had several boyfriends, all of whom left her and/or treated her badly. In "Xatu the Future", she revealed that she had once worked at a T.V. station as the Weathergirl. In "From Cradle to Save" is also revealed that she once was a ninja.
She has a long-standing bitter rivalry with Cassidy, another member of Team Rocket. Another member, Wendy, held a grudge against Jessie for failing to pay for a drink (making Wendy pay), but got her revenge when she added the charge to Jessie`s overall Team Rocket bill.
In the episode "Ignorance is Blissey", Jessie was reunited with her friend Chansey from the Pokemon nurse school; Chansey had since evolved into a Blissey.
Starting in Hoenn, Jessie has become a Pokemon Coordinator, entering every contest that she could. She frequently makes it to the battle round, but usually loses there. However, in "Borrowing on Bad Faith", she finally succeeded in winning an (unofficial) contest by using Ash`s Aipom, which she had saved earlier in the episode. And, in "Team Shocker!", she finally wins an official contest with her Dustox in at Solaceon City. Later she also won a ribbon with help of her Yanmega. She has Contest Passes to compete in the Hoenn, Kanto, and Sinnoh regions.
While Jessie`s role in the Pokemon anime has not yet ended, in Toshihiro Ono`s manga, "The Electric Tale of Pikachu", she ended up married to James and with child.
Jessie seems to have a special preference for snake-like Pokemon, owning both an Arbok and a Seviper. In "The Ninja Poke Showdown", she expressed a preference for Poison-type Pokemon in general.
For unknown reasons, she, James and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation.
In the Kanto contests, Jessie disguises herself as Jessebella (which is similar to James former fiancee Jessiebelle) wearing a red dress and glasses. Eventually, Ash, Brock, Max and May finds out her true identity at the last contest.
During the Kanto Grand Festival, Jessie dresses up as Jessadia (Japanese: キャンディ・ムサリーナ Candy Musalina). and wears glasses, long white socks, a yellow and orange dress, and has her hair in pigtails. She works there as an announcer and Lilian Meridian`s assistant; Lilian herself says she may not really like "Jessadia"`s style, but recognizes her talent. In the Latin American dub, she enters Super Contests under the name Jessiebella (referencing Jessiebelle again). Jessie currently still continues to use the Jessalina disguise while participating in Super Contests.
In "Pruning a Passel of Pals!" and "Strategy With a Smile!" she once again used her Jessadia disguise to report on the Wallace Cup.
Although Jessie had entered mostly every contest in Hoenn &amp; Kanto, she lost in every single one, whether it was the first match of the Battle Rounds or the finals. But in the Sinnoh Region, she has so far won 2 ribbons using her Dustox and Yanmega.</description>

<description>Meowth is a very unique Pokémon as it has many of the characteristics of a human. It walks on two feet, talks and is as smart as any human. Meowth is currently a member of Team Rocket and he travels around with Jessie and James trying to capture Pikachu and other rare Pokémon for Giovanni.
Meowth generally finishes his sentences with "Nyaa (ニャー)" which is the equivalent of "meow" in English. This helps people remember that despite his ability to talk like a human, he still has cat character traits.
Meowth is also known for coming up with his many schemes to try to capture Pikachu. While Jessie and James always agree with Meowth and think his plans are brilliant, they are generally foiled by Ash and his friends.
Long Con to Access Raimon City Pokémon Center
Meowth schemed with Jessie, James and Doctor Zager to figure out a way for them to infiltrate the Raimon City Pokémon Center where high-leveled Pokémon are stored in a vault that is protected by a security machine scan system that would only open if Nurse Joy (Isshu) or Nurse Joy`s Audino were scanned. Meowth pretended to be no longer part of Team Rocket making up a story that his made an error while executing a certain operation and when headquarters hear of his mistake, they told him he was fired.
Ash, Iris and Cilan believed him and allowed Meowth to travel with him. Pikachu though didn`t trust Meowth even though Meowth proved on numerous occasion that it should be trusted. Meowth`s plan was put into action when they arrived at the Raimon City Pokémon Center and as soon as Nurse Joy`s Audino was scanned to open the door, Meowth turned on Pikachu and the other and captured all the Pokémon in the vault. The long con had been a success and Meowth met up with Jessie and James below the Pokémon Center. Unfortunately, they weren`t able to get away as Ash and his friends realized that Meowth had just been conning them and they were able to stop Team Rocket.</description>

<description>James is one part of of the Team Rocket trio that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokémon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
James is mostly a comedic parody of bishounen characters; the English dub in particular tends to give him a melodramatic and even campy tone. He is somewhat famous for carrying a rose, though in more recent episodes he does not display it often. Mostly, his rose is displayed in the Team Rocket motto.
The only child of millionaires, James was forced to endure formal society. At a young age, he was forcefully engaged to a girl of whom he was terrified, Jessiebelle, all because his parents wanted to have a wealthy daughter-in-law. Thus, he ran away from home, leaving behind his beloved pet Growlie. He attempted to enroll in Pokémon Tech, a trainer`s school, but, along with his new friend Jessie, flunked out. Then, with Jessie, he joined the Sunny Town bicycle gang, where he was popular for being the only gang member to have to use training wheels (nicknamed "Trainer Jim"). Eventually James, Jessie, and the bike gang went their separate ways.
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between James and Jessie after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Since he is proficient in several activities, including Pokémon haiku and PokéRinger, it is possible that he developed his skills during his temporary separation from Jessie, but this is not known for sure.
In the episode "Holy Matrimony!", James returned to his home as a result of a trap by his parents, who pretended to be dead. He was reunited with his old pet Growlie and managed to avoid marrying Jessiebelle. Growlie stayed behind when James returned to Jessie and Meowth.
James has a tendency to be swindled by a Magikarp Salesman, who has on many occasions tricked him into buying a Magikarp or other useless Pokémon and items for large sums of money.
James also has a tendency to cross-dress, but has not done it since "Pros and Con Artists". He does, however, dress up like famous celebrities as well, such as Professor Oak, Juan, and Norman.
James loves rare bottle caps and has an impressive collection of them. In the episode "All That Glitters!" it is revealed that he has "drunk enough soda pop to float an aircraft carrier".
For unknown reasons, he, Jessie and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation. However in newer episodes the balloon is shown with `jets` attached to explain how they get from one place to another faster than walking.</description>

<description>Annie is the partner and older sister of Oakley.
Both she and Oakley are named after Annie Oakley, in the same manner as the Rocket duos Jessie and James, Butch and Cassidy, and Attila and Hun.
Unlike her younger sister Oakley, Annie is a little less concerned with the task at hand, and appears to be slightly more vain. Prettier and more suave than Oakley, Annie is enchanted by the beauty of the Soul Dew, rather than the abilities of the Defense Mechanism of Alto Mare, or capturing Latias and Latios for Giovanni - she even screams that her outfit is ruined when she falls into a canal.
Ditzy as she appears, Annie is more in control than Oakley is, as Oakley goes somewhat mad with power when commandeering the Defense Mechanism of Alto Mare (DMA), despite Annie`s concerns about using it
Not much is known about Annie nor her sister before Pokémon Heroes, but their reputation precedes them; James instantly recognizes them.
In the dub, they were assigned a mission by Giovanni, implying Team Rocket membership, but this is not present in the original.
Excellent at balance and athletics, she has no trouble making huge leaps and cartwheels while fighting Latios and Latias and keeping perfect balance on a beam which Jessie, James and Meowth have trouble with. She also have some very advanced technology at hand - she has glasses which can identify Latias when disguised and can see Latias and Latios when invisible, and they capture Latios using what appears to be a net of energy.
However, Annie is rarely seen using these devices; it usually falls to Oakley.
At the very end of Pokémon Heroes, Annie climbed into the DMA to join Oakley and ended up getting stuck inside it. They were rescued by police, and ended up in a heavily-guarded prison. The last we see of the two is them in said prison, looking at a picture book about the events of the second movie. Presumably, both are still behind bars.</description>

<description>Oakley is one of the main antagonists from Pokémon Heroes. She is the partner and younger sister of Annie.
Both she and Annie are named after Annie Oakley, in the same manner as the Rocket duos Jessie and James, Butch and Cassidy, and Attila and Hun.
Although the younger sister, Oakley appears to be the brains behind the operation. Annie may be more suave, but it is Oakley who masterminds the plan. Unlike Annie, Oakley has a lust for power - Oakley is quick to use the DMA, and once at its helm, her desires for power take over - in the dub, "I can control the whole world from in here!"; in the original, "Now this city is mine!" (もうこの町はあたしのもののよ!).
She only uses it briefly, but Oakley is quick to learn how to use the DMA. In that time, she floods Alto Mare, almost drowns Ash, resurrects Kabutops and Aerodactyl fossils, among other things. Adept as she may be at using it, however, she does not know where to stop, and that eventually proved to be her downfall.

<description>The Beginning
Ash is the main character of the Pokémon anime. Raised in Pallet Town, he started his journey to become a Pokémon Master at the age of 10. On the day that he started his journey, Ash carelessly woke up late despite being told by his mother, Delia Ketchum to get to bed. He rushed to Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory only to find out that the beginner Pokémon - Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander - had already been given out to trainers who arrived on time. However, Professor Samual Oak mentioned that there was one more Pokémon available - Pikachu. Despite constantly hitting Ash with Electric-type attacks and refusing to return to its PokéBall, Ash decided to take Pikachu along with him on his journey to become a Pokémon Master. Pikachu is cold towards Ash at first and laughs at his failures; however, when Ash saves Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow, he begins to warm up to his new trainer and the two finally become friends. After the battle with the flock of Spearow, a Ho-Oh is seen flying towards a rainbow in the sky. The PokéDex reveals that the Ho-Oh is an unidentified Pokémon. Thus, the journey of Ash and Pikachu begins.
Captures in Viridian Forest
While making his way towards Pewter City and his first Kanto League Gym Battle, Ash came upon a wild Caterpie deep within Viridian Forest. Instead of using Pikachu to battle against the wild Pokémon, Ash took his chances and threw a PokéBall without weakining the Caterpie first. Luckily, he was able to catch the Pokémon without any trouble. The capture of Ash`s Caterpie marked Ash`s first capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Caterpie the second Pokémon to join his team.
The next day, while continuing the trek through the Viridian Forest, Ash came up on a wild Pidgeotto. He tried to just throw a PokéBall like he did with Ash`s Caterpie, but Pidgeotto swatted the PokéBall away. Misty informed that he must weaken the Pokémon first before attempting to capture it. He called out Ash`s Caterpie to battle against, but Misty quickly informed him that Bug-type Pokémon are weak against Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeotto. After Pidgeotto dealt significant damage to Ash`s Caterpie, Ash recalled it and sent out Pikachu. Pikachu was able to use its Thundershock to weaken Pidgeotto and allow Ash to capture it with a PokéBall. Thus, this capture marked Ash`s second capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Pidgeotto the third Pokémon to join his team.
Later on, while still in the Viridian Forest, Ash was approached by Team Rocket, who attempted to steal his Pokémon. After defeating Meowth, James`s Koffing, and Jessie`s Ekans, Ash`s Caterpie evolved into Ash`s Metapod.
Some of Ash`s greatest accomplishments have been at the various Pokémon Leagues. He was the victor at the Orange League and the Battle Frontier. He also competed in the Indigo League and the Johto Silver Conference where he placed admirably in both those competitions as well.
Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup
Ash participated in the Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup at the Kagome Town stadium. In the first round he was in the fifth match and faced off against Marris. The match was quickly showcased and Ash won the battle and advanced to the second round while Marris was eliminated from the tournament.
The Isshu League
Ash participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where he was matched up against Trip. Trip`s Serperior was sent out to battle Pikachu and Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior`s speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter Trip`s Serperior speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round. The two met in the Pokémon Center after the battle, and Trip vowed that the next time they met that he would win. The two shook hands and parted ways.
In the first main round, Ash`s opponent was shown on the match up electronic board but not much else is known about the battle. Ash`s Scraggy participated in the second main round of the Isshu League tournament where it faced off against a Darumakka. It was able to defeat it so that moved on to the next round.
In the third round, Stephan was matched up against Ash. Cilan noted that the two of them have a very direct taste and that it would be a good battle. It was only a 3 on 3 battle but the both of them gave it their all. The first two battles of the third round setup the final match up of Stephan`s Sawk vs Ash`s Krookodile, both of which were very injured from the previous battles. Both of them did their best to muster up their reserve strength but in the end a surprise move of Aerial Ace by Ash`s Krookodile was super effective against Stephan`s Sawk and it knocked it out to give Ash the victory while eliminating Stephan from the tournament. Stephan realized after the battle that the reason that Ash withdrew Waruvial after the first battle was because Ash knew that Stephan would definitely send out Dageki, so he didn`t reveal that it knew Aerial Ace and saved until the end.</description>

<description>The Beginning
On the morning that Ash was to start his Pokémon journey, he woke up late and by the time he reached Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory, all of the beginner Pokémon were already taken. However, Professor Samual Oak did have one Pokémon left, a wild Pikachu. At first, Pikachu did not like Ash and would refuse to enter his PokéBall. He would often laugh at Ash`s failures and refused to listen to him. However, after Ash proved his loyalty to Pikachu by protecting him from a flock of Spearow, and thus began to earn Pikachu`s trust and respect. The two have since become best friends and Pikachu never leaves Ash`s side.
Since the day Team Rocket first encountered Pikachu, it has been their sole goal to capture it. Day after day, their plan to capture Pikachu has been thwarted mainly due to Pikachu`s amazingly powerful Thunderbolt that keeps on blasting them off.
On numerous occasions, Pikachu has made it evident that he is happy being a Pikachu and has no desire to evolve into a more powerful Raichu. It has proven time and time again that it is a powerful and worthy opponent to any Pokémon that dares to battle it.
Gym Battle against Burgh`s Leavanny
Pikachu was then sent out to battle Burgh`s Leavanny. Burgh`s Leavanny managed to tie up Pikachu with String Shot but unlike Ash`s Swadloon who was able to break free, Pikachu ended up getting hit with a couple of Leaf Storm attacks and a Hyper Beam before it rolled into another of Burgh`s Leavanny`s Leaf Storm attacks to break the string off its body so it could attack. Freed from the String Shot, Burgh`s Leavanny tried to tie it up again but Pikachu managed to avoid it with its speed and then knocked Burgh`s Leavanny out with a combination of Iron Tail and Electro Ball.
Gym Battle against Elesa
Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy and was then matched up with Pikachu. Pikachu made quick work of Elesa`s Emolga and knocked it out with one attack, its Iron Tail.
Elesa`s Tynamo was the last Pokémon that she used in her gym battle against Ash. It was matched up against Pikachu who had just defeated her Emonga. Pikachu had a hard time defending against the fast Tackle attack that Elesa`s Tynamo kept hitting it with but Pikachu used its Thunderbolt to create a large dust cloud leaving only a small corridor for Pikachu to focus on it and so Elesa`s Tynamo couldn`t maneuver out of the way. Pikachu one hit K.O`d Elesa`s Tynamo with a Iron Tail. The loss gave Ash the overall victory.
Battle against Alder`s Bouffalant
Ash challenged Alder to a battle and he accepted though he had been walking all night and was actually quite tired. Alder sent out his Buffron to battle Pikachu but just as the battle started, Alder fell asleep standing up and didn`t give any orders to his Buffron. Alder`s Bouffalant stood still as Pikachu began hitting it with attack after attack until it Alder`s Bouffalant finally got mad at Alder and charged at him and set him flying into a tree. After that, Alder`s Bouffalant no longer wished to battle and Alder conceded the battle.
Gym Battle against Skyla
In Skyla air battle simulation, Ash`s Tranquill was matched up against Skyla`s Unfezant and since her Pokémon was the highest evolved form, she determined that her Pokémon would be the winner in that match-up. In the actual gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was up against Skyla`s Unfezant which was the match-up just after Ash`s Tranquill had defeated Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla`s Unfezant proved to be stronger and faster than Ash`s Tranquill, so Ash recalled it and set out Pikachu. Pikachu had a definite advantage over Skyla`s Unfezant with its electric attacks and it quickly knocked it out with its Electro Ball attack.
Ash Just after Pikachu ended up knocking out Skyla`s Unfezant, Skyla`s Swanna was sent out to battle against it. Skyla had been watching her grandpa`s battle videos and noticed that he used the move Aqua Ring to defend against Electric attacks. She used that same defense against Pikachu which nullified its Electric attacks. It`s Iron Tail also couldn`t hit it so high in the air. Ash then noticed the rings in the air and Pikachu jumped up on them and managed to hit Skyla`s Swanna but not directly. Pikachu was now up in the air though and Skyla`s Swanna had the advantage there and it quickly knocked Pikachu out with a powerful Brave Bird attack.
Battle Against Trip`s Serperior at the Isshu League
Pikachu participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where it is was matched up against Trip`s Serperior. Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter its speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round.</description>

<description>While Wobbuffet is technically Jessie`s Pokémon, it has been around so long that it has become a main character, appearing in almost every episode of the series since it debut.
Wobbuffet was first seen walking around with Benny, his previous trainer. Jessie traded her Lickitung for Wobbuffet and it has been with her ever since that day.
Wobbuffet rarely battles but when he does, his Counter and Mirror Coat moves have proved to be very effective. Unfortunately, Jessie`s tactics aren`t always sufficient to master Wobbuffet`s superior defensive skills.
Wobbuffet also randomly comes out of his Pokeball, especially during the Team Rocket motto. He is also seen blasting off with Jessie regardless if he was actually part of the action.</description>

<description>He is a Pokémon researcher that was once a competitive Trainer, and is generally considered the best in his field. As such, his role in the Pokémon games and anime is that of a mentor to young Pokémon Trainers, a source of information and an occasional plot device. Amongst other things, he is credited with inventing the Pokédex. He also hands out a Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander to beginning trainers (depending on which Pokémon the trainer chooses) to start their adventure in the Kanto Region. Although he is an expert on all matters relating to Pokémon, Professor Oak specializes in Pokémon behavioural science. He appears in Pokémon 4Ever as a child who was pulled into the future by Celebi. Additionally, it is apparent after Pokémon 3: The Movie that he knew Delia Ketchum since she was a child; this most likely is the reason he occasionally exhibits parental-type concern (mainly in the form of scolding Ash as he is doing something that is dangerous). He also creates poems centred around Pokémon and is known as the rhyming professor by Dawn.</description>

<description>Lawrence III is a Pokémon Collector who captured the three legendary bird Pokémon Moltres, Zapdos and Articuno in the Orange Archipelago. He began his collecting with an Ancient Mew card and legendary Pokémon were always his passion. His goal was to use the legendary birds to summon Lugia so he could capture it.
He was very familiar with the ancient legend regarding the Legendary birds which states: Disturb not the harmony of fire, ice or lightning, lest these titans wreak destruction upon the world in which they clash. Though the water`s great guardian shall arise to quell the fighting, alone its song will fail, and thus the earth shall turn to ash. O Chosen One, into thine hands bring together all three. Their powers combined tame the Beast of the Sea. He thought that he was the Chosen One when he read this legend.
Moltres, Zapdos and Articuno all attacked his flying ship enough to disable it and cause it to crash but that did not stop Lawrence from attempting to still capture Lugia. Realizing that it would be captured, Lugia attacked his airship and destroyed the remains, thwarting Lawrence`s attempt to capture Lugia. Lawrence vowed to restart his Pokémon collection though after he picked up his Ancient Mew card off the ground near the ruble of his ship.
In the fifth Pokémon movie, Lawrence III appears in a book during the ending credits that Annie and Oakley were reading.</description>
