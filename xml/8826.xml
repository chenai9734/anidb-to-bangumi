<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

The player assumes control of one or several fictional characters (a party) who have joined forces in order to perform quests and overcome a great number of challenges and enemies, usually monsters inspired by fantasy, and, to a lesser extent, science fiction and classic mythology. During the course of the game the characters, or avatars, which are generally defined by quantized characteristics, evolve and improve in that their various attributes increase, as well as by gaining more powerful artefacts.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>In our terms, a proxy battle is a battle where humans use creatures/robots to do the fighting for them, either by commanding those creatures/robots or by simply evolving them/changing them into battle mode. Often the training aspect is also involved, or in some cases the proxies are nothing more than holographic representatives of some other variation of competition (like for example a card game). While many popular shounen anime fit under this category, it`s not limited to shounen anime.</description>

<description>Bulbasaur is known as the Seed Pokemon. Bulbasaur looks like small, rounder turquoise dicynodon, a mammal-like reptile from the Permian Period. Bulbasaur`s most distinctive feature is the green bulb planted on its back. The plant sprouts and grows with the Pokemon. The bulb synthesizes solar rays. It can later use the energy stored for recovering itself (Synthesis) or release it in the form of a Solarbeam. Because of this Bulbasaur is usually seen napping in bright sunlight. The bulb constantly takes in nourishment from the sun, allowing both the Bulbasaur and the bulb to grow over time. It also allows them to go days without eating by using the nutrients stored in the bulb.</description>

<description>Ivysaur is known as the Seed Pokémon. While almost the same as Bulbasaur the bulb on its back has grown. Having grown much larger, the bulb forces their legs to become stronger and thicker to accommodate the weight, and makes it harder for them to stand on their hind legs. Both the Ivysaur and the bulb grow stronger and larger from sunlight. When the bulb is ready to bloom, they will spend more time lying in sunlight, and the bulb will give off a sweet scent.</description>

<description>Venusaur known as the Seed Pokémon, is the final stage in Bulbasaur evolution. The seed finally bloomed into a huge flower, vaguely resembling a Rafflesia. The flower constantly draws in sunlight for nutrition, characterized by vivid colors and a soothing aroma, and power, which is much more substantial in the summer. They are always on the move to absorb more sunlight, though they usually remain quiet and still while absorbing it. After it rains, the aroma is much stronger, which attracts other Pokémon. Female Venusaur have a seed coming out of the flower, possibly representing a pregnancy. Being the final form of Grass starter, Venusaur can learn Hyper Beam, Giga Impact and Frenzy Plant.</description>

<description>Charmander known as the Lizard Pokémon, is a fire type Pokémon. The Name comes from "Charcoal" (a material used to Create Fire) and "Salamander". They are selectable as one of three "Starter Pokémon" at the beginning of the games of the main series of Pokémon RPGs that are set primarily in the Kanto region (Pokémon Red and Blue for Game Boy, as well as their remakes Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen for Game Boy Advance). Charmander are not acquirable anywhere else in the main series aside from Pokémon Yellow. Charmander is a Fire Dinosaur-Lizard Type Pokémon. It`s name is from the words char meaning to cook and mander meaning a salamander which is a lizard-like amphibian. The end of a Charmander`s tail is alight with a flame, and the flame`s status reflects both the physical health and the emotions of the individual. If the flame were to ever go out, the Charmander would die.</description>

Charmeleon are excessively savage and short-tempered by nature, and they are made to be powerful fighters as a result. The flame on its tail, carried over from its Charmander stage, may burn a bluish white when the Pokémon is excited, and the air temperature often raises to very high levels when the tail flame is waved around.</description>

<description>Charizard is a dual-type Fire/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Charmeleon starting at level 36. It is the final form of Charmander. It can Mega Evolve into two forms: Mega Charizard X using Charizardite X and Mega Charizard Y using Charizardite Y. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Charizard is the game mascot of Pokémon Red and FireRed Versions.
Charizard is a draconic, bipedal Pokémon. It is primarily orange with a cream underside from the chest to the tip of its tail. It has a long neck, small blue eyes, slightly raised nostrils, and two horn-like structures protruding from the back of its rectangular head. There are two fangs visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is closed. Two large wings with blue-green undersides sprout from its back, and a horn-like appendage juts out from the third joint of each wing. A single wing-finger is visible through the center of each wing membrane. Charizard`s arms are short and skinny compared to its robust belly, and each limb has three white claws. It has stocky legs with cream-colored soles on each of its plantigrade feet. The tip of its long, tapering tail burns with a sizable flame.
Charizard has two Mega Forms. Both feature a shorter snout, white, vertical slit pupils, and a bright underside reaching the lower jaw.
As Mega Charizard X, its body and legs are more physically fit, though its arms remain thin. Its skin turns black with a sky-blue underside and soles. Two spikes with blue tips curve upward from the front and back of each shoulder, while the tips of its horns sharpen, turn blue, and curve slightly upward. Its brow and claws are larger, and its eyes are now red. It has two small, fin-like spikes under each horn and two more down its lower neck. The finger disappears from the wing membrane, and the lower edges are divided into large, rounded points. The third joint of each wing-arm is adorned with a claw-like spike. Mega Charizard X breathes blue flames out the sides of its mouth, and the flame on its tail now burns blue. It is said that its new power turns it black and creates more intense flames.
As Mega Charizard Y, it becomes sleeker in appearance but retains its normal coloration. It has three pointed horns on the back of its head, the middle of which is longer. Its snout has larger fangs and a ridge on the nose. Its neck is shorter, but its torso is thinner and longer. It features longer digitigrade feet. Its hands are less developed, with extremely shortened fingers that are no longer separated from each other. Small wings develop on its wrists, while the ones on its back become larger, lose the wing finger passing through their membrane and end up with ragged edges. The back of its tail has a large spike at the base and three smaller ones near the tip, which now burns with a longer flame. Mega Charizard Y is said to have incredible flying prowess that is greater than a jet fighter.
As Gigantamax Charizard, it becomes larger and physically fit. The lower part of its body glows white with several yellow diamonds located on the lower belly. There are also diamond-shaped spots located on the front legs. The claws located on its hand and feet become longer and sharp. The feet become longer and digitigrade, retaining small glowing soles under the forefeet. The wings are transformed into literal flame wings extending to the shoulder blade and two flames located on the horns. The colossal, flamed wings were created from the energy of Gigantamaxing. The sclera of the eyes becomes yellow. The glow of a flame can be seen in the mouth, and the teeth grow, with the lower front teeth and three teeth in the middle now protruding when the mouth is closed. The flame on the tail extends out and has three red clouds surrounding it. The flames within Gigantamax Charizard burns hotter than 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit. When it roars, the temperature can climb to even higher lengths. The wings are capable of being hotter than magma which Charizard uses to burn its opponents.
Charizard flies in search of powerful opponents to battle, and its fire will burn hotter as it gains experience. Its fiery breath is capable of melting boulders, massive glaciers, and has been known to accidentally cause forest fires. In the past, Blast Burn was its signature move. Charizard typically inhabit mountains and valleys, such as the Charicific Valley in Johto. The anime has shown that only a weak Charizard would show off its power. It also showed that Charizard can swim underwater, with Pokémon Origins further showing that the flame on the tip of the tail can still keep burning underwater. The wings of Charizard can carry to an altitude of 4,600 feet.
Charizard is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Wildfire.</description>

Squirtle are not acquirable anywhere else in the main series aside from Pokémon Yellow. The name "Squirtle" is a portmanteau of the words "squirt" and "turtle". When feeling threatened, Squirtle withdraw their limbs into their shells and spray water from their mouth with great force, either to attack their opponent or merely to intimidate it.</description>

Wartortle are more aggressive than Squirtle, and their shells often feature scratches obtained in battles with other Pokémon. Their ability to swim is greatly aided by their long ears and long, fluffy tail for balance. Their tails are long enough that when a Wartortle withdraws into its shell, part of the tail still sticks out. They can apparently live for thousands of years.</description>

In the main Pokémon game series, a Blastoise is only acquired when a Wartortle grows past experience level 36 and evolves into a Blastoise. As a Blastoise, two sections of the hefty shell open up to reveal cannon-like spouts on the Pokémon`s back that can fire pressurized water at a target with enough force that even concrete walls and thick steel can be punctured. The spouts are also very accurate, since a Blastoise can strike distant tin cans with the water from its spouts!</description>

<description>Caterpie known as the Worm Pokémon, are larval Pokémon found in the wild early in the Kanto and Johto regions. In main series Pokémon games set in these regions, Caterpie are among the earliest and easiest Pokémon species caught by players, as they are very weak. They can be evolved into their cocoon-like Metapod form and eventually into the butterfly-like Butterfree form. Caterpie in the wild employ biological adaptations to survive, much like real caterpillars, in that their green bodies are useful for camouflage in foliage, their eyes are patterned to scare away predators, their suction-cup feet allow them to climb any surface, and the osmeterium on their heads can project a horrid stench to repel predators. It bears a resemblance to the spicebush swallowtail caterpillar.
In the anime, Caterpie as the first Pokémon Ash ever caught in his trainer career, and it eventually evolved into a Butterfree and was later traded for a Raticate on the S.S. Saint Anne but is traded back later in the episode. Ash releases it later so it could mate with a pink Butterfree.</description>

In main series Pokémon games set in these regions, Metapod are among the earliest and easiest Pokémon species acquired by players, either by catching one in the wild or training a Caterpie past experience level 7 and evolving it into a Metapod. They can evolve into the butterfly-like Butterfree when raised past experience level 10. A Metapod`s exterior is regularly hardened to protect its soft and tender innards while undergoing metamorphosis to eventually become a Butterfree. To conserve energy for this event, the Metapod barely moves.</description>

<description>Butterfree is a dual-type Bug/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Metapod starting at level 10. It is the final form of Caterpie. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Butterfree resembles a vaguely anthropomorphic butterfly with a purple body. Unlike true insects, it only has two body segments and four light blue legs. The upper pair of legs resembles small, three-fingered hands, while the lower pair resembles long, digit-less feet. Butterfree has two black antennae, a light blue snout with two fangs underneath, and large, red compound eyes. Its two pairs of wings are white with black venation. Two oval scales on a female Butterfree`s lower wings are black, but they are white on a male.
As Gigantamax Butterfree, its size increases to gigantic length with altered look. The wings and its pattern changes to light and dark green color with white. The antennae change to bright green and extends to the point where the tip bends, and three red clouds surround it. The eyes changes to bright glowing red. A fur-like circle is attached to both the wings and back of Butterfree. Several green scales can be seen floating around Butterfree, which are its most effective weapons, capable of releasing paralysis, poisoning, or sleep. The massive wings are powerful enough to lift a 10-ton truck through a simple flap. The wind it generates can scatter poisonous scales throughout the area, making it dangerous to be near it.
Butterfree`s wings are covered with poisonous powders that fall off continuously as it flies. It will defend Caterpie from bird Pokémon using this powder. This powder also repels water, enabling it to gather honey even in the rain. Butterfree will roam up to six miles (ten kilometers) from its nest in search of honey, which it carries with the hairs of its legs. Sometimes it has territorial disputes with Cutiefly over fields of flowers. It also consumes sap from trees pierced by Heracross, as seen in the anime. Butterfree is found in temperate forests and jungles, but it has also been observed flying near the ocean as part of its migratory breeding pattern.
Gigantamax Butterfree is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Befuddle.</description>

<description>Weedle, known as the Hairy Bug Pokémon, are larval Pokémon found in the wild early in the Kanto and Johto regions. In main series Pokémon games set in these regions, Weedle are among the earliest and easiest Pokémon species caught by players, and they are very weak Pokémon that are captured to be evolved into their cocoon-like Kakuna form and eventually into the hornet-like Beedrill form. Commonly spotted in the forests and grasslands, eating leaves, Weedle are well protected from predators by sharp two-inch barbs on their heads which secrete a strong poison, and another stinger is on each Weedle`s rear. Sniffing with its big red proboscis, a Weedle uses its extremely acute sense of smell to find the types of leaves it eats.</description>

<description>Kakuna, known as the Cocoon Pokémon, are pupal Pokémon found in the wild early in the Kanto and Johto regions, of which its larval form is the worm-like Weedle. In main series Pokémon games set in these regions, Kakuna are among the earliest and easiest Pokémon species acquired by players, either by catching one in the wild or training a Weedle past experience level 7 and evolving it into a Kakuna. They can evolve into the hornet-like Beedrill when raised past experience level 10. Within the shell, a Kakuna busily prepares itself for evolution into its adult form, and the amount of energy released by this process makes the shell quite hot to the touch. In the wild, Kakuna are often found near or on trees, and because their range of motion is extremely limited, they may be mistaken for dead. Carelessly approaching a Kakuna in this state would be extremely unwise because it can still extend the barb of its poisonous stinger to protect itself from threats.</description>

In main series Pokémon games, Beedrill are only acquired by training a Kakuna past experience level 10 and evolving it into a Beedrill; whereas many other Pokémon evolve into their final forms at much later levels, Beedrill`s early availability makes it a temporarily strong asset to Pokémon Trainers starting out on their journeys. Beedrill are extremely territorial, and will be set off by anything that approaches a Beedrill nest. When angered, Beedrill attack in a furious swarm, and the sharp ends of their stingers and the poison stored in their abdomens will definitely be put to use.</description>

<description>Pidgey, known as the Tiny Bird Pokémon, is a bird-like Pokémon, whose original name in the English beta version of Pokémon Red and Blue was "Pidge". Pidgey was first introduced in the United States in Red and Blue. They are one of the first wild Pokémon that players encounter in those games. Pidgey does not like to fight, and will use its wings to stir up clouds of sand in an attempt to distract its would-be opponent and escape. Pidgey also uses this technique to bring its preferred prey of small insects into the open. Pidgey seems to possess magnetoception, as it is capable of returning to its nest from any location without fail.
Pidgey also appeared in the first television episode, Pokémon, I Choose You!, when the main character, Ash Ketchum, attempts to catch one. He fails when it uses its Gust attack to blow him away and escapes. Afterwards, it uses its Sand Attack to blind Ash, allowing it to get away.</description>

In the main Pokémon game series, a Pidgeotto is only acquired when a Pidgey grows past experience level 18 and evolves into a Pidgeotto. A Pidgeotto is extremely territorial, generally claiming a large area with its nest built in the center. Full of vitality, it constantly patrols its territory, mercilessly attacking intruders. They fly about in circular patterns while hunting, and can spot the movements of their prey on the ground no matter how high they fly. The Pidgeotto attacks with its wickedly sharp talons and carries its prey, including Exeggcute and Magikarp, back to its nest from as far as 60 miles away - or more.
Pidgeotto was the second Pokémon Ash caught in the beginning of his career, eventually evolving into Pidgeot.</description>

In the main Pokémon game series, a Pidgeot is only acquired when a Pidgeotto grows past experience level 36 and is evolved into a Pidgeot. Pidgeot are large, powerful birds admired for their glossy plumage and their battling ability. With their powerful chest muscles at work, Pidgeot can flap their wings fast enough to whip up gusts of winds to rival tornadoes. Pidgeot are very aerodynamic, capable of soaring to an altitude of 3300 feet and reaching speeds of up to Mach 2. Like Pidgeotto, Pidgeot feed on Magikarp by swooping from the sky and snatching them out of the water with their talons. Pidgeot appear very similar to Pidgeotto, so much so that one has been easily mistaken for the other, even by official sources.
In the Pokémon anime, Ash`s Pidgeotto evolves into a Pidgeot near the end of the Kanto saga, and remained in Pallet Town to watch over a flock of Pidgey and Pidgeotto while Ash went off to the Orange Islands.</description>

It eats insects in grassy areas by flushing them out with its wings, and plucking at them with its beak. Its wings aren`t good for long distance travel or high flying, but it is able to fly at high speeds by flapping its wings very rapidly. It is very territorial, constantly buzzing about and calling with a loud cry that can be heard from half a mile away. It serves to scare away predators and keep in touch with other Spearow, which usually is used to alert them of danger. The golden spearow has golden wings and a golden beak, it also has a lighter color of brown feathers.</description>

It flies high into the sky, and swoops down at its prey. By using a combination of its neck and beak, it has a large reach, allowing it to pluck bugs from the ground or easily pluck prey from soil or water as it swoops down. If it senses danger, it avoids it if possible.</description>

<description>Pikachu is an Electric-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Pichu when leveled up with high friendship and evolves into Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone. However, the starter Pikachu in Pokémon Yellow will refuse to evolve into Raichu unless it is traded and evolved on another save file.
In Alola, Pikachu will evolve into Alolan Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone.
It also has a Gigantamax form.
Pikachu is popularly known as the mascot of the Pokémon franchise and a major representative of Nintendo`s collective mascots.
It is also the game mascot and starter Pokémon of Pokémon Yellow and Pokémon: Let`s Go, Pikachu!. It has made numerous appearances on the boxes of spin-off titles.
Pikachu is also the starter Pokémon in Pokémon Rumble Blast and Pokémon Rumble World.
Pikachu is a short, chubby rodent Pokémon. It is covered in yellow fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back. It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch for electricity storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is a patch of brown fur. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs.
The anime has shown that wild Pikachu live in groups in forested areas. Pikachu communicate amongst themselves using squeaks and tail-shaking as friendly gestures. In the anime, Alolan Pikachu are known to greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Electricity can be used to receive and send messages with each other, as well as other Electric Pokémon species. It raises its tail to check its surroundings and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups grow, they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. Pikachu forages for Berries, which it roasts with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that Pikachu inhabits a location is patches of burnt grass. It has been observed eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment.
Pikachu charges itself while sleeping overnight, though stress and a lack of sleep can affect this. It is able to release electric discharges of varying intensity. Pikachu has been known to build up energy in its glands, which it will need to discharge to avoid complications. It is also able to release energy through its tail, which acts as a grounding rod, as well as recharging fellow Pikachu with electric shocks. Pikachu can also electrify itself to use its signature move Volt Tackle.
Pikachu has three alternate forms: one, the Cosplay Pikachu appeared exclusively in Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. It is always female, has a black heart-shaped spot at the end of its tail, and can be dressed in any of five outfits corresponding to the five Contest conditions. The second form is Pikachu in a cap, which debuted as an event-exclusive Pokémon in Generation VII. It is always male and has seven variants, each wearing one of Ash`s hats from the anime. In addition to these two forms, many other Pikachu variants have appeared in various media. The last, Partner Pikachu is the Pokémon the player starts with in Pokémon: Let`s Go, Pikachu!. This Pikachu can be either gender, has higher base stats, and has access to moves that normal Pikachu do not.
As Gigantamax Pikachu, it becomes larger and chubbier. Its tail becomes longer and stores all of the electricity it generates, causing it to glow a bright yellow and enabling it to become as powerful as a lightning strike. Its power is equal to that a power plant; however, it is difficult to use it in peoples` homes since Pikachu can only remain in its Gigantamax form for a short time.
Pikachu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Catastropika, while Pikachu in a cap has its own exclusive Z-Move, 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt. Partner Pikachu is the only Pokémon capable of using Zippy Zap, Floaty Fall, Splishy Splash, and the Partner Power, Pika Papow. Pikachu is the only Pokémon capable of using the Light Ball item. Gigantamax Pikachu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Volt Crash.</description>

It also has a white underbelly, brown stripes on its back, and yellow cheeks, in contrast to Pikachu`s red cheeks and Pichu`s pink cheeks. In the main Pokemon game series, a Raichu is only acquired when an item called a Thunderstone is applied to a Pikachu so that it evolves into a Raichu. Raichu can only learn moves in the Pikachu stage, so the only way to make Raichu learn more moves is by using a TM. Raichu can generate 10,000 or even 100,000 volts of electricity, enough to knock out Pokemon several times its size, such as a Dragonite, as stated in the anime. Raichu`s name is a portmanteau of the kanji 雷 rai, meaning thunder, or lightning bolt, and chuu, which is the Japanese onomatopoeia for a mouse`s squeak.</description>

<description>Sandshrew are a species of brick-skinned mouse-like Pokémon found in several regions throughout the Pokémon world. Despite its name, Sandshrew`s appearance borrows more from the armadillo or the pangolin than from the shrew; its primary means of defense when threatened is to instantly curl up its body into a ball, leaving only its tough skin exposed. When it is rolled up like this, Sandshrew has the potential to withstand many attacks, as well as being dropped from a great height (also similar to hedgehogs). Sandshrew`s natural environment is deep underground in arid, sandy locations with very little moisture, such as a desert. It chooses this habitat to keep its hide as dry and tough as possible, while the sand also provides it with good camouflage.
In keeping with its physical characteristics, Sandshrew has high Defense in the video games, but low Speed. From Ruby and Sapphire onwards, it has the ability Sand Veil, which increases its evasion during a sandstorm. Sandshrew also appears in the spin-off game Pokémon Snap.
A Sandshrew owned by A.J. is featured in the eighth anime episode, "The Path to the Pokémon League." It had many notable traits, such as the ability to withstand water and its knowledge of Fissure, which it used to dispatch Team Rocket.</description>

Generally they are a moderately large, bipedal hedgehog or pangolin-like creature with hard yellow skin, lengthy claws, and a back loaded with an assemblage of large brown spikes. These spikes are hardened sections of Sandslash`s hide that grow to form a natural self-defense when Sandslash curls into a ball. Each spike remains on Sandslash for one year, after which it falls off and a new spike grows in its place. Sandslash can be found in desert areas, particularly close to dry forests. Sandslash`s spikes serve a number of purposes to help cope with its environment, such as providing shade to protect it from the sun and heatstroke or using them offensively to harm both predators and prey. It uses its claws to climb trees, cut up food and dig, the latter being an activity that can cause them to break if done too quickly. It cannot run very quickly, but it is very quick with its claws.</description>

Nidoking have immense upper-body strength, being able to snap a telephone pole like it were a twig. It uses its tail to smash down its target, then constrict it to break its bones. Its thick tail packs enormously destructive power capable of toppling a metal transmission tower.
As several Pokémon seem to have been designed to resemble other aspects of Japanese pop culture and mythology, it is interesting to note that Nidoking bears a resemblance to Baragon, a monster that has appeared in the Godzilla movie series.
In the main Pokémon game series, a Nidoking can only be acquired when a Moon Stone item is applied to a Nidorino so that the creature is evolved into a Nidoking. They are the masculine equivalent to Nidoqueen. Also, they are more primal, fighting other Nidoking for such matters as territory or food. (Or a Nidoqueen, in mating season.)</description>

<description>Clefairy are small, bipedal Pokémon. Popular as pets for their adorable features, Clefairy have short, pink fur, with a large brown patch on each of their two pointed ears. Between these ears is a large swirl of pink fur. They have two small eyes, no nose, and a small mouth with one tiny, protruding fang. They also have a patch of darker pink fur under each eye, which seems to resemble blushing cheeks.
Clefairy can be seen playing in groups, on the night of a full moon, retreating to their group slumber when dawn arrives. These Pokémon are noted to be able to store moonlight in the wings on their backs, giving them the power to float in mid-air. There have been sightings of Clefairy, with their evolutionary forms Cleffa and Clefable, using spaceships, and the Moon Stones used to evolve Clefairy are also rumored to come from extraplanetary locations. Clefairy seem to be based on fairies, as they are magical, winged creatures, lending credit to their name. Also, their game call seems to make a sound similar to their Japanese name.
Clefairy`s biology is somewhat unclear. While they cannot truly fly with their wings, they do travel in a bouncy skipping walk, as if walking on the surface of the moon. When they wave their finger, it stimulates the blood and triggers their brain to perform random attacks from any other Pokèmon, which is the basis of their signature Metronome attack.</description>

<description>Clefable is similar to Clefairy in appearance. It is larger than its pre-evolved form, with prominent ears and a pair of jagged wings on its back. Clefable inhabit remote mountainous areas and generally any environment that has sufficiently little ambient noise. Clefable`s hearing is extremely sensitive - it is said that it can discern the sound of a pin falling 1,100 yards (1,000 m) away, so it is averse to living in areas with sound pollution (compare with Whismur).
Clefable are also extremely timid, and rarely seen in the wild. They avoid all contact with outsiders. Even sensing the presence of others in the area (which is fairly easy thanks to their prodigious hearing) will cause it to run and hide immediately. They will, however, come into the open on quiet, moonlit nights to take a stroll on a lake.
Clefable`s wings are probably not fit for real flight, but they allow it to move in a skipping, bouncy manner as if it were walking on the moon`s surface. They can even walk across the water`s surface this way, so when it takes the aforementioned stroll on the lake, it literally takes a stroll on the lake. Clefable`s wings, its hovering walk, its timidity and elusiveness have led them to be categorized as a type of fairy in the Pokemon world.</description>

<description>Vulpix is a fox-like creature with six curled tails, based on the Japanese fox spirit kitsune. Most commonly female, Vulpix are especially known for being beautiful. As Vulpix undergo Pokemon evolution, their red fur turns pale yellow and they grow three extra tails. Vulpix usually have a friendly, if not spoiled, temperament. Because of the flame in their bodies, when the temperature outside increases, they let flames out of their mouths to prevent their body temperature from getting too hot. In the wild, Vulpix will feign injury to escape from more powerful predators.
During the first season of the Pokemon anime, Vulpix appears often as one of Brock`s Pokemon. It was given to him by a girl named Susie who felt she could not take care of it well. Brock, who felt he was only "babysitting", gives it back to Susie in the season four episode called "Beauty and the Breeder".
Its Japanese name, Rokon is a portmanteau of six (六, roku) and kon (from kon kon, an onomatopoeic word describing the bark of a fox), or an alternate reading of the Japanese word for kitsune (狐, kitsune), meaning fox - in this case, the reading is ko (こ). Its English name may have been derived from the scientific name for a group of foxes, Vulpes.</description>

<description>Ninetales is a yellow nine-tailed fox, based on the kitsune, a Japanese fox spirit. Ninetales is highly intelligent and able to understand human speech, but also vengeful; Ninetales have been recorded as putting a 1,000 year curse on anyone who grabs one of their tails, which is a focus of the plot in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team. They, along with Vulpix, have keen senses of smell, hearing, and sight. It can only be obtained by using a Fire Stone on a Vulpix. Its Japanese name Kyuukon comes from a combination of the Japanese number 9, kyu, and the sound of a barking fox.
In the anime, Ash and the gang find an abandoned mansion and Brock is deceived by a Ninetales, whose master strongly resembles Brock.
Since it has nine tails, the Pokemon`s name is very commonly misspelled as "Ninetails." Even the Game Boy Color port of the Pokemon Trading Card game uses this misspelling.</description>

<description>Jigglypuff, known as the "Balloon" species of Pokémon, are characterized by putting their enemies to sleep by singing a lullaby. Before beginning to sing, they mesmerize the opponent with their soft, glowing eyes, and if they inflate themselves, they can sing for longer periods of time. They can easily adjust the wavelength of their voices to that of the brain waves of a sleeping being, allowing for their pleasing melody to put its audience to sleep. They sing without pausing to take a breath, so if the opponent is resistant to sleeping, they potentially run out of air.
In the Pokémon anime series, Jigglypuff is a recurring character who aspires to be a great singer after the inspiration of Ash Ketchum and company. Unfortunately for it, every potential audience falls asleep before the song finishes. Jigglypuff does not usually choose an appropriate time to sing and has been a hazard many times, causing Ash Ketchum and his companions to often find themselves running away from Jigglypuff. It keeps with it a black marker, its "microphone," and uses it to scribble on anyone who falls asleep while it`s performing.
Its desire to have someone listen to the entire song was finally satisfied when it encountered a Whismur, who was able to stay awake due to its Soundproof ability.
Also, Jigglypuff`s Japanese name, Purin, translates into "pudding".</description>

<description>Wigglytuff is a relatively large pink balloon-like Pokemon with a white underbelly, large blue baby-like eyes, a pair of large rabbit ears, and a twisty tuft of pink hair on its forehead. It evolves from Jigglypuff through a Moon Stone. In fact, it`s remarkably similar to its pre-evolved form, Jigglypuff, except the ears have grown larger and it now maintains an "oval" shape. Wigglytuff`s eyes are always covered by a thin layer of tears, so that if any dust gets into Wigglytuff`s eyes, it is quickly cried away. In the games, Wigglytuff`s fur is described to be "sublime", so much so that if two of them come into close contact with each other, they are difficult to separate. In the television series, Wigglytuff is generally accepted as the most powerful Pokemon.</description>

<description>Zubat are a basic bat Pokémon species found commonly in the wild in most caves in all the regions of the Pokémon world. In caves and other dark places it navigates using ultrasonic waves. It appears that Zubat is weakened by sunlight, so it hides in caves or other dark places. At night, it will come out and hunt for fruit or Venomoth, or it sucks blood. The female`s fangs are smaller than the male`s.
In the anime, Brock catches a Zubat before entering Mt. Moon. Since then it has evolved to Golbat and then into Crobat. Crobat was given to Forest, with Onix and Geodude by Brock, becoming a Gym Leader.</description>

<description>Golbat are a larger, stronger, and more developed form that Zubat take on when they gain enough experience. In the main Pokemon game series, a Golbat is acquired when a Zubat grows past experience level 22 and is evolved into a Golbat. Golbat are found in some cave areas.
Golbat is a fierce, nocturnal Pokémon, residing in the darkness of caves, and is most active in the pitch black of night, especially if the moon is in its new phase. It is widely known and despised for its feeding behavior: Sucking fresh blood from living things in large quantities. Once it has found a living target, it attacks in a stealthy manner, often striking without warning from behind, to harshly bite down on its prey with its four sharp fangs strong enough to puncture the hide of any animal-like Pokemon, however strong the hide might be. It then proceeds to drink ten ounces of blood instantly. Golbat enjoys blood so much that it does not want to stop, even though a lot of blood will weigh it down enough so that, if it is able to even fly afterwards, it flies clumsily.
Surprisingly, after each attack and feeding sequence, Golbat`s own blood type changes into that of its victim. Once it strikes, it will not stop draining energy from the victim even if it gets too heavy to fly. Like Zubat, the female`s fangs are smaller than the male`s.</description>

<description>Oddish are a weed-like Pokémon found in all regions throughout the Pokémon world. (with the exception of Pokémon Blue and Pokémon Leaf Green) Oddish looks like a small animated onion/turnip plant with a rounded body. Its body is blue or purple with two small feet and red eyes. On top of its head grows a large clump of 5 long green blades of grass. Its name likely came from the words "odd" and "radish".
Oddish is a nocturnal Pokémon, using moonlight rather than the sun`s rays for photosynthesis. During the day, Oddish avoids the sun`s heat and brightness by burying itself into the earth, leaving only the leaves on top of its head visible above ground. In this way it disguises itself as a plant, misdirecting its carnivorous diurnal predators.
While buried, Oddish nourishes itself by absorbing nutrients from the soil using its feet, which are said to temporarily change into a root-like structure for this purpose.
Oddish has been known to use its leaves as hands, such as one who used this to climb a rope net and tried to fly like a Hoppip.
If anyone pulls at Oddish`s leaves and tries to uproot it while it is buried underground, Oddish will react by shrieking in a cute, high-pitched voice. This mirrors the behavior of the legendary mandrake in a similar situation, although it seems that Oddish`s squeaks do not have the same dire consequences as a mandrake`s.</description>

<description>Gloom is a flower-like Pokémon that is a larger and stronger evolution of Oddish. Gloom are obtained when an Oddish gains enough experience to grow up to level 21. Gloom can also be found in most grassy areas of most regions.
The fluid that oozes from its mouth is a sweet nectar that is used to attract prey. Once the prey is attracted, the nectar will cling to the prey, trapping it. The nectar mostly attracts prey that lack a sense of smell, as the nectar smells horrible.
As well as its nectar, the pistil of Gloom`s flower smells incredibly foul; it can be smelled from over a mile away. It has been found that approximately 1 in 1,000 people enjoy the scent that Gloom emits. Those that don`t enjoy the smell have been known to faint upon smelling it. When Gloom is faced with danger, the stench worsens. If it is feeling calm or secure, it does not release the horrible aroma. Oddly enough, people have been known to sniff Gloom, just to get a reaction. This is similar to real world drug addiction.
It is said to widely shower its attacks; with moves such as Stun Spore, Poison Powder, and Sleep Powder, it has the ability to cause status problems on its foes. It is also notable that Gloom has two evolved forms (from the second generation onwards), Vileplume and Bellossom. Unlike other Pokémon that evolve via level, Gloom will not evolve until it is exposed to an evolution stone; a Leaf Stone will make a Vileplume, while a Sun Stone produces a Bellossom.</description>

<description>Vileplume is a huge flower-like Pokémon that is a larger and stronger evolution of Gloom. Vileplumes can be obtained by using a Leaf Stone with a Gloom.
Vileplume is known for its extremely offensive stench that comes from its large red flower. Vileplume uses this stench in battle, catching its foes off guard when they start to back away from the horrible smell. However, Vileplume`s flower can actually be a hindrance in battle due to it being very heavy and bulky. Due to of its weight, Vileplume walks very slowly, and it often must use its hands to help support the flower. Vileplume can be found in forests and they like to stay low to the ground. When they sleep, their huge petals droop over their head and they blend in more with the plants around them. They also release toxic, dense pollen into the air in this position so animals don`t go near them. At night, they sometimes gather together to perform odd rituals - during this time they release toxic pollen to deter intruders. The white markings on this flower are larger in the female than in the male. Paul uses Vileplume to battle Tyrogue, but his Vileplume is useless for Fighting-type Pokemon.</description>

Paras is born with tiny spores covering their body, which grow as the Pokémon feeds, called tochukaso mushrooms. It is noted in that the relationship between the host and the mushrooms is a symbiotic relationship: the mushrooms will sap energy from the host, causing the Paras to continuously burrow underground in forest areas to gnaw on tree roots, since the tochukaso draws most of the energy from the roots. In return, the mushrooms defend the host by spraying toxic spores at enemies. The mushrooms themselves have strong healing properties, and are valued for their life extending properties.</description>

Venonat, though it is based on a bug, is covered in thin, stiff fur, which is said to be used for protection. It has two concentrated clusters of microscopic, red eyes. They can be used to shoot powerful beams, and also function as radar, which enables Venonat to be active at night and to easily capture its preferred prey of small, nocturnal insects. Venonat prefers the dark, inhabiting the hollows of trees and other shadowed areas, yet is attracted to bright lights.</description>

Its wings are covered in extremely toxic, dust-like scales. These scales are color-coded to indicate the effect they will have upon coming into contact with a living creature, darker colours meaning poison, and lighter colours meaning paralysis. Venomoth is similar to Butterfree in that they both flap their wings to release toxic powders. However, Venomoth seems to be the more dangerous of the two, as it is described as scattering its toxins with every flap of its wings. Much like Venonat, Venomoth is nocturnal and feeds upon small insects.</description>

<description>Meowth is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves into Persian starting at level 28. It also has a Gigantamax form.
In Alola, Meowth has a Dark-type regional form. It normally evolves into Alolan Persian when leveled up with high friendship. However, in Pokémon: Let`s Go, Pikachu! and Let`s Go, Eevee!, it instead evolves into Alolan Persian starting at level 28.
In Galar, Meowth has a Steel-type regional form. It evolves into Perrserker starting at level 28.
Meowth is a small, feline Pokémon with cream-colored fur that turns brown at the tips of its hind paws and tail. Its ovoid head features four prominent whiskers, wide eyes with slit pupils, two pointed teeth in the upper jaw, and a gold koban coin embedded in its forehead. Its ears are black with brown interiors and are flanked with an additional pair of long whiskers. Meowth is a quadruped with the ability to walk on its hind legs; while the games always depict Meowth on two legs, the anime states that Meowth normally walks on all fours. It can freely manipulate its claws, retracting them when it wants to move silently. The tip of its tail curls tightly.
Meowth is attracted to round and shiny objects and has the unique ability to produce coins using Pay Day. Being nocturnal, it is known to wander about city streets at night and pick up anything that sparkles, including loose change. Upon finding a sparkling object, its eyes will glitter and the coin on its forehead will shine brightly. It shares this intrigue with Murkrow, with whom it often fights with for objects and prey. Meowth is a playful but fickle Pokémon with the capacity for human-like intelligence. At least one member of the species teaching itself how to speak. Meowth tends to live in urban areas.
Meowth was introduced to Alola as a gift to royalty. The luxurious royal lifestyle soon led to Meowth diverging from its origins and becoming the selfish, prideful, and cunning Alolan Meowth. Alolan Meowth will turn hysterical if its coin or pride are besmirched. When the monarchy fell, the rare Alolan Meowth went feral and eventually grew as common in Alola as anywhere else. Alolan Meowth`s fur is a light blue-gray color. Instead of brown markings, the tip of its tail, whiskers, digits, and the insides of its ears a whitish-gray. Alolan Meowth`s whiskers have a slight curve compared to regular Meowth`s straighter whiskers, and it has silvery eyes.
Galarian Meowth has a shaggy, greyish-brown coat resembling a beard, as well as yellow eyes and a toothy grin. Its coin is now black and extremely hard, with the hardest coins being especially valued. Galarian Meowth`s body has partially turned to iron as a result of many years of living with a race of savage seafarers.
As Gigantamax Meowth, it has become larger and longer in size. The body extends from lower half to the shoulder, while the gold coin gains a symbol. Meowth`s eyes change to a glowing gold color. The tail grows long as well, with the end of it tips extending. Three red clouds surround it below the shoulders. The giant coin emits a lot of Gigantamax power that surrounds the area with a golden gleam. Its desire for shiny objects increases to the point where it will cause damage to skyscraper windows and exterior walls for the sake of sharpening its claws.
Gigantamax Meowth is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Gold Rush.</description>

They live in fresh-water lakes and rivers, where they are seen gracefully swimming, especially at dusk. As the fastest swimmers out of all Pokémon, they can out swim even the most athletic of humans, though they often train with swimmers. As they are able to swim in severe storms, they are sometimes found rescuing people lost at sea from danger.</description>

In battle, it subtly undulates the spiral-shape on its belly to put the foe to sleep, using a type of hypnosis. It is also capable of easily escaping the grasp of foes due to its greasy skin. Poliwhirl`s spiral goes in the opposite direction of Poliwag`s. Poliwhirl`s mouth is no longer visible after evolution, but it is concluded that it moved to the center of its spiral, since it now sprays water from there.
In the Pokémon anime, Misty had a Poliwhirl in the Johto series, which later evolved into Politoed. Red owns one in the Pokémon adventures which eventually it evolves into a Poliwrath.</description>

<description>Abra (Hocus in English-language beta versions of Pokémon Red and Blue) is a vaguely fox-like psychic Pokémon, which is always depicted to be sleeping in a sitting position. The brown upper torso seems to be armored and it appears to wear two pauldrons.
Abra are described as sleeping eighteen hours a day to conserve their psychic abilities. They also constantly use teleportation while asleep; changing their location once an hour, teleporting away when they sense danger or are attacked, and creating illusory copies of themselves. This constant use of teleportation is Abra`s defining characteristic in the video games.
In the Pokémon anime, Abra appears several times, first in Episode 21, Abra and the Psychic showdown, where it is used by the Saffron City gym leader and evolves into Kadabra. Abra has also appeared in the episode Psychic Vs. Ghost! Midnight Showdown, where he appears to have a main role in the episode.</description>

<description>Kadabra is a strong psychic Pokemon that owes much of its power to the alpha waves it emits from its body at all times. These alpha waves are affected by Kadabra`s current mental state - if it has a headache, the waves change. The psychic power it gives off can also trigger off headaches to nearby humans. It is also said to grow more powerful when faced with a difficult opponent. The silver spoon that Kadabra holds amplifies the waves` power - if it does not hold a spoon, it is said to be limited to half the usual amount of its telekinetic powers. It has been claimed that one morning, a boy with extrasensory powers woke up to find that he had become a Kadabra, but this has not been verified (it could possibly be an urban legend in the Pokemon world due the way it is told in the Pokedex, or a tongue-in-cheek reference to the way Uri Geller supposedly discovered his "psychic" powers - see below).
The alpha waves are described as being generated when all of a Kadabra`s brain cells work together or when Kadabra suffer from headaches. Kadabra are noted for being able to double the amount of alpha particles at will. The alpha waves can cause headaches in others and even cause machines to malfunction.
In November of 2000 it was reported that Uri Geller, an Israeli "psychic"-magician who claims to bend spoons with his mind, sued Nintendo over the Pokemon "Yungerer" (renamed Kadabra in English localizations) which he claimed was an unauthorized appropriation of his identity. The Pokemon in question has psychic abilities and carries bent spoons. He also claimed that the star on Kadabra`s forehead, and the lightning patterns on its abdomen, are symbolisms popular with the Waffen SS of Nazi Germany, and was outraged at the connotations that Nintendo had supposedly made. Although the symbols are derived from Zener cards, the name is a pun; the katakana n (ン) resembles the kana ri (リ) (the translation of Mr. Geller`s name into Katakana would be ユリゲラー Yuri Geraa). Geller sued for the equivalent of $100 million, but lost.</description>

<description>Alakazam loses the thick tail it once possessed as Kadabra (which might explain why it is 19 pounds lighter than Kadabra). It stands on two legs and always holds two silver spoons. Parts of Alakazam`s body are brown, but its predominant coloring is gold. Alakazam has a long, gold moustache - nonetheless, some Alakazam are female, though in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, females have dramatically smaller moustaches, while the males have longer ones.
Alakazam are described as extremely intelligent. With an IQ of 5,000, they can outperform supercomputers and can memorize anything. Alakazam use their superior intelligence to immediately identify their opponents` weaknesses and gain the edge in battles. This intelligence and superb memory are said to come from the fact that Alakazam`s brain cells never stop multiplying - as a result, the overly large head must be supported by its telekinetic powers. In fact, Alakazam use their psychic abilities to watch all "movement", as their muscles are too weak. Also their senses are incredibly strong: just by closing its eyes it can heighten all the other senses dramatically. Alakazam evolves from Kadabra when you trade it to another Pokémon game.
Alakazam is notable for having the highest Special Attack among non-legendary Pokémon, a statistic that affects the power of mental, fluid, and energy-based attacks, though it shares this title with another Pokémon, Porygon-Z. To balance its extremely high Special Attack, Alakazam`s other stats are atrocious, save for its high speed and average Special Defence, though this is offset by an awful HP stat. Alakazam made an appearance in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, as the leader of Team ACT.</description>

<description>Machoke evolves from Machop at Level 28. An interesting fact about Machoke is when seen in its "shiny" version, it shares a striking resemblance to that of The Hulk, being green in color.
Machoke`s name is a portmanteau of macho, meaning tough, and choke. The Japanese name Goriky is a pun on the Japanese word for superhuman strength (剛力) or godlike strength. Its name was originally "Kong-Fuu" in beta English versions of Red and Blue, which is a reference to Kung fu. Its signature moves include submission, cross chop and dynamic punch.
Machoke, along with its evolved form Machamp, is nicknamed as one of the bodybuilders of the Pokémon world, due to its humanoid appearance, huge muscles and the fact that it wears black speedos, and the belt round its waist makes it look similar to a wrestler (which is most probably what the pokemon was based on). The belt is known as a "Power Save" belt, which keeps Machoke`s power under control and helps to regulate its motions. The explanations of the belt`s purpose vary, but is quoted that because it is so dangerous, no one has ever attempted to remove it.
Machoke has had relatively few anime appearances, most of which were in the Jouto region, most notably in "Machoke, Machoke Man!", in which Machoke was Chuck`s signature Pokemon, and shared a very close bond with its trainer, who sparred and even used submission on during training. Machoke also appear as employed heavy lifters and construction workers, and can also be seen in the beginning of the games Pokémon Saphire and Ruby where a group of Machoke are seen carrying furniture into the players home, which are replaced by Vigoroth in pokemon Emerald.
Despite being measured at 4`11" in the Pokedex, whenever Machoke appear in the anime, they are always around the same height, or taller than, an adult male.</description>

<description>Machamp is a Fighting-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Machoke when traded. It is the final form of Machop. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Machamp is a large, humanoid Pokémon with four well-muscled arms. It has bluish gray skin, red eyes, and pale yellow lips. On its head, there are three brown ridges right above its eyes. It has two arms on each side of its body: a pair located in the normal position, and another pair directly above that attaches on the top of the shoulders. It has black markings that resemble briefs and wears golden power-save belt that resembles a championship belt. Its legs have considerable muscle tone, and its feet have two toes each.
Machamp punches extremely fast, throwing five hundred punches a second. With only one hand, it can move a mountain. Because of its four arms, it can hit from a multitude of angles and pin all of its foe`s limbs at once. Its arms also allow it to attack and defend simultaneously. The four arms react faster before Marchamp think. However, it has poor dexterity, and cannot handle delicate work without its arms becoming tangled. It is a rash Pokémon that rushes into action without forethought. Being the result of an evolution via trading, Machamp is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in the mountains. In the past, it claimed Low Kick, Vital Throw, and Strength as signature moves.
As Gigantamax Machamp, it has become larger with several changes. Its blueish-gray skin becomes darker. The middle ridge located on head becomes longer compare to the other two. All three ridges are also darker now. The neck extends with black markings. The fours fists are now colored dark orange with yellow lines connecting to two orange spots on each arm. The golden belt extends with several more dots. The P in the middle of the belt is colored white and connected to a single yellow circle with nothing in between. The black markings on its leg extend to the legs but stopping near the ankle.
Due to Gigantamaxing, the arms are filled with power, the punches it makes can hit as hard as bomb blasts. There is a legend where Gigantamax Machamp saved a large ship that was in trouble before bringing it to a port.
Gigantamax Machamp is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Chi Strike.</description>

<description>Bellsprout is a carnivorous, flower-like Pokémon, hunting small insects with blinding agility despite its skinny body. It is said to ensnare its prey in its vines and devour it, and can also spit a highly corrosive fluid that can melt even iron. Bellsprout`s preferred habitat is warm and humid climates, since it can absorb more moisture from the ground by planting its root-like feet. In battle, Bellsprout can take advantage of its flexibility to bend and sway its way out of the range of its opponent`s attacks, no matter how powerful they may be.
In the video games, Bellsprout is commonly found among grassy routes, and is used by many Trainers who favor the Grass-type. In Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, the Sprout Tower in Violet City is dedicated to Bellsprout.
Bellsprout has appeared numerous times in the anime series, most notably in "The Fourth Round Rumble," where Ash battled one during the Indigo League. He eventually defeated it with Muk.</description>

<description>Weepinbell is a bell-like Pokémon that resembles its pre-evolution Bellsprout, but without the vines and leaves. Instead of walking, it hops along or hangs on to tree branches and vines using the large hook on its rear end. Weepinbell immobilizes its enemies by using Poisonpowder and Acid. It will swallow anything that moves and digest it within its stomach, and produces a neutralizing fluid to keep from being affected by its own strong stomach acids. If its prey is larger than it, it will first use sharp leaves to slice it up before eating.
Players can obtain a Weepinbell by catching it in the wild, evolving Bellsprout upon reachng level 21, or Snagging a Shadow Weepinbell in Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness. In Pokémon Ranger, enemy Weepinbell can swallow the protagonist whole, knocking him or her back to the beginning of the area.
Weepinbell has appeared in relatively few episodes in the Pokémon anime. It first appeared in "The School of Hard Knocks," and later when Celadon City Gym Leader Erika battled Ash with one. James` Victreebel was also briefly seen as a Weepinbell.</description>

<description>Victreebel is a carnivorous Pokémon based on the pitcher plant. It lulls its prey with a sweet, honey-like scent, and also the vine on its head (which waves as if it were an animal) before digesting it with powerful stomach acids that can even dissolve bone. Normally, its prey are bugs, but it has been known to attack and consume small animals. Victreebel cannot be caught in the wild in any of the Pokémon video games; it must be evolved from Weepinbell with a Leaf Stone.
In the anime, James of Team Rocket had a Weepinbell which evolved into Victreebel in the episode "The Breeding Center Secret." As a running gag, it usually tried to eat him as soon as it emerged from its Poké Ball (this tradition of James`s Grass-type Pokémon hurting him was continued by Cacnea in the Advanced Generation series, and Carnivine in the Diamond and Pearl series). While most Pokèmon speak in a vocabulary consisting of its own name, Victreebel, like Lapras, communicates through loud, high-pitched shrieks.</description>

<description>Tentacool (メノクラゲ, Menokurage?) is an aquatic Pokémon based on the box jellyfish. It drifts aimlessly wherever the ocean currents take it, sometimes ending up in shallow waters where it may be accidentally caught in fishing lines. Tentacool may also end up stuck on beaches when low tide comes; since its body is largely composed of water, it will shrivel up, risking death from dehydration if it stays out of the sea for too long. Tentacool has two main weapons. At the tips of its tentacles are toxic feelers, which it uses to stab anything it touches with stinging acid. Due to its excellent camouflage in the water, Tentacool can often remain undetected by swimmers right up to the moment it stings them. Tentacool`s gelatinous, watery body can also absorb sunlight and refract it within, producing beam energy it shoots from its crystal-like eyes.
Tentacool is available in all Pokémon games to date. It is extremely common, especially while surfing on sea routes, and is in almost every single body of water.
In the anime, Tentacool was featured in the episode "Tentacool and Tentacruel" in which a raging mob of the titular Pokémon attacked the Porta Vista resort. The episode was banned after the attacks on September 11, 2001 due to its scenes depicting Tentacools and Tentacruels destroying buildings at a seaside resort.</description>

<description>"Tentacruel" is probably a portmanteau of "tentacle", the reason for which is obvious, and the adjective "cruel", referring to its personality. The name may have something to do with the deep-sea jellyfish called Tentaculata. Its name was originally going to be Man-O-War, which refers to the Portuguese man o` war. The Japanese name, "Dokukurage," is a portmanteau, of 毒 doku (poison) and 水母 kurage (jellyfish). It resembles its pre-evolution Tentacool to a small degree - the "head" of Tentacool has now been made into a hat-like shape on top of a black orb containing its eyes and two very large hooks which resembles a long nose. Also, unlike Tentacool, it has up to 80 tentacles, most of which are hidden, leaving up to 14 exposed.</description>

<description>Geodude has a rock for a head, no nose, and two long arms that start with a bulging muscle and end with rock hands resembling a human`s. Geodude most frequently are found in fields and on mountains. People step or trip on them from time to time, mistaking them for rocks. Its arms are so strong that it can use them to climb mountains. Rhyperior sometimes accidentally shoot Geodude from their cannon-like arms. Geodudes are one of the few Pokémon to have appeared in every Pokémon game.
In the video games, Geodude is commonly found inside caves and mountains, and sometimes appears when Rock Smash is used. Geodude are also found in the Nintendo 64 game Pokémon Snap, hanging from mountainsides by their arms. In the Super Smash Bros. Melee battlefield "Poké Floats", a Geodude is the last float the fighters ride on before returning to the Squirtle float.
Geodude is a recurring character in the Pokémon anime. It first appeared in the fifth episode, "Showdown in Pewter City," used by Gym Leader Brock to battle Ash. Brock became a travel companion of Ash and owned Geodude for the first five seasons. Navel Island Gym Leader Danny and Rustboro City Gym Leader Roxanne have also used Geodude. In the anime, Geodude is able to levitate above the ground.
Geodude`s name comes from the word "Geode" as in a rock with a sparkly inside, and "Dude," usually used to describe a certain kind of male person.</description>

<description>Graveler resembles a large boulder with four arms and two legs. It lives and feeds on rocky mountains. It will climb the slope of a mountain daily, snacking on small rocks along the way, and roll back down once it has reached the peak. Though it is not very fast when walking, a Graveler rolling down a mountain trail is a very dangerous thing to encounter. Carefree by nature, Graveler ignores most obstacles that may appear in its path, such as grass, trees, boulders or even hikers, since it can roll through or over them more often than not. It is not essentially harmed rolling down the slope, even if the odd jutting piece of its body gets broken off. Machop are known to use Graveler as training weights.</description>

It will annually shed its skin like a reptile, with its new shell often being bigger than the one before. Its body is almost impenetrable, able to withstand dynamite blasts; it can even detonate its own body, launching itself great distances in order to travel from mountain to mountain. When earthquakes occur near where Golem live, they will tumble down mountains, rolling at an incredible speed.
In the video games, the only way to obtain Golem is to evolve a Graveler by trading it to another player.
Golem has made numerous appearances in the Pokémon anime. It first appeared in the episode "The Bridge Bike Gang," in which Chopper, the leader of a bicycle gang, uses one to battle Ash`s Charmander.
Golem`s name comes from the word "golem," which is a humanoid clay or stone statue associated with Jewish mysticism.</description>

<description>Ponyta is a Fire-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves into Rapidash starting at level 40.
In Galar, Ponyta has a Psychic-type regional form. It evolves into Galarian Rapidash starting at level 40.
Ponyta is an equine Pokémon with cream-colored fur. It has brown eyes and triangular ears with reddish interiors. Yellow and reddish-orange flames form its mane and tail. The mane forms a short crest on top of its head and a short strip down its back to its tail. Additional flames are present behind its elbows and knees. The fire appears about an hour after hatching. It has four long legs, each ending in a single, gray hoof. These hooves are said to be harder than diamonds.
Ponyta has extraordinary jumping abilities and is capable of leaping tall buildings in a single bound. However, a newborn Ponyta is a weak runner and is actually barely able to stand. It gradually strengthens its legs and becomes faster by chasing after its parents. In the anime, it is shown that Ponyta can control its flames so that its rider is not burned by them. Ponyta live in grasslands, on plains, or anywhere that it can run freely.
In the Galar region, Ponyta has adapted to forests by being exposed to the life energy from it. It has chalk-white fur; long, purple-and-blue, cloudy fur that is also on top of its dark-purple hooves; purple eyes with light-blue irises; and a purple-and-white horn on top of its forehead. Galarian Ponyta can absorb the life energy located in the atmosphere and store it in its mane, which will then become more colorful and potentially release a shining glow if there is a lot of energy to use. The small horn contains a healing power. Ponyta can heal any slight wounds with a few rubs from its horn. By looking it the eyes of a person, it can read the contents of the heart. Should Ponyta find any evil, it will promptly go back into hiding.</description>

In Galar, Rapidash has a Psychic/Fairy-type regional form. It evolves from Galarian Ponyta starting at level 40.
Rapidash is an equine Pokémon with cream-colored fur and a pointed horn on its forehead. It has small, red eyes and triangular ears with reddish interiors. Yellow and reddish-orange flames stream from the back of its head to form a long, flowing mane. A short version of the mane trails down its back to its equally fiery tail. Flames are also present on its fetlocks. It has slender legs, each with a single black hoof.
Rapidash is a very agile Pokémon. It runs at about 150 mph (240 km/h), chasing everything that moves in hopes of racing it. With incredible acceleration, it reaches its top speed in only ten steps. At full gallop, its hooves barely touch the ground. The faster Rapidash goes, the longer the swaying flames of its mane will become. At an all-out gallop, its blazing mane sparkles, a feature which is said to enhance its beautiful appearance. Rapidash lives in grasslands, but it can also be seen on mountains in Pokémon Snap.</description>

It evolves into Slowbro starting at level 37 or Slowking when traded holding a King`s Rock.
In Galar, Slowpoke has a pure Psychic-type regional form, introduced in Pokémon Sword and Shield`s 1.1.0 patch. It will evolve into Galarian Slowbro using an item found on the Isle of Armor or Galarian Slowking using an item found in the Crown Tundra.
Slowpoke is a pink Pokémon that resembles a cross between a salamander and a hippopotamus. It has vacant eyes that never seem focused, curled ears, and a rounded, tan muzzle. It has four legs, each of which ends in a single white claw. Its long, tapering tail has a white tip. This tail drips a sweet, sappy substance that is attractive to many species of fish. Slowpoke uses the tail as a fishing lure. The tail often breaks off, but it will grow back. In Alola, its tail is often dried and used in home cooked stews.
Slowpoke has notoriously dim intellect, and often forgets what it was doing. It takes a long time to respond to outside stimuli. For example, it can take up to five seconds to process pain and can take an entire day to notice when its tail has been bitten. Slowpoke is commonly found at the water`s edge. In some places, it is believed that Slowpoke`s yawn causes rain. This Pokémon is worshiped in those areas.
In Galar, Slowpoke gains yellow markings on its forehead and tail.</description>

<description>Slowbro is a slow and dopey Pokémon that evolves from Slowpoke. Its name a portmanteau of slow (as in "slow-witted") and bro (as in "brother", probably relating to the fraternal relationship it shares with the Shellder on its tail). Slowpoke becomes Slowbro when a Shellder clamps down on its tail, yet it is so slow and dopey it is sometimes unaware of the change until it gets out of the water. Its Japanese name is most likely derived from 宿借り yadokari (hermit crab). The Shellder which bites on its tail sucks on the aforementioned syrup, and so it is hard to remove. Also toxins which leak from the bite pass into Slowbro, which numbs its immunity to pain even more. The relationship between Slowpoke and Shellder is symbiotic; being attached to the Slowpoke enables the Shellder to travel on land, whereas the weight of the Shellder on its tail enables the Slowpoke to walk on its hind legs, freeing the use of its arms.</description>

<description>Magnemite is almost more of a machine than a creature, as it is a solid ball of metal with a pair of horseshoe magnets on either side, as well as a single, lidless eye. It has a pair of screws protruding from below the eye, and a large screw forming a sort of "cap" on top of its head.
It floats through the air, through a sort of electromagnetic antigravity field generated by the two magnets on either side of its body. When defending itself in the wild or fighting in a Pokémon battle at the orders of a Pokémon trainer, it can also generate powerful electric shocks. Magnemite consumes electricity, so they`re attracted to power lines and electronic gadgets. Magnemite tend to crowd around generators and power plants, and an individual Magnemite might be attracted to someone with a pocket radio or a Pokégear.
Despite their mechanical appearance, lack of gender, and alien tendencies, Magnemite are living things; they are not built, they feel the need to eat, and they have something similar to a mating urge. A trio of Magnemite may come together to create their evolved form, Magneton.</description>

<description>Farfetch`d is a dual-type Normal/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
In Galar, Farfetch`d has a Fighting-type regional form. Galarian Farfetch`d evolves into Sirfetch`d after landing three critical hits in a single battle, regardless of if it faints.
Farfetch`d is an avian Pokémon that resembles a light brown duck with a white underbelly. It has a flat, yellow beak, brown eyes, a V-shaped black marking on its forehead similar to a unibrow, and a three-feather crest on top of its head. Its wings are as big as its body and appear to be prehensile enough to substitute for hands. It has yellow legs with webbed feet and a stubby tail.
Farfetch`d is always seen carrying a leek stalk or spring onion. It carries this sprig in its wings, but sometimes chooses to hold it in its beak or feet instead. Unable to live without its stick, Farfetch`d will defend the stalk with its life. Losing it can leave Farfetch`d defenseless. Known uses for the stick include use as a weapon, nesting material, and emergency food source. It is selective about which sticks it will use and has been known to fight over good ones. Farfetch`d is found in temperate grasslands.
Galarian Farfetch`d is a deeper shade of brown, with a more prominent black mark on its head. As the leeks in Galar are much larger than those elsewhere, it carries its leek over its wing in order to better manage its heavy weight. It is renowned for its courage in battle.
Farfetch`d and its evolution Sirfetch`d are the only Pokémon capable of using the Leek item.</description>

It inhabits and races across grass-covered plains at 60 mph. It is well-adapted to dry and arid climates. Doduo`s second head is said to have been formed by a sudden mutation thousands of years ago. Both heads normally contain identical brains, although rare cases have been observed where a Doduo has two distinctly different brains.
Interestingly, Doduo can be caught in the wild in all of the Pokémon video games. Doduo can also be found in Pokémon Snap.
In the Pokémon anime episode "Bad to the Bone," Jessie of Team Rocket battles a Doduo with her Arbok. The battle is interrupted when the Doduo`s heads begin to fight with each other.</description>

<description>Dodrio is a flightless bird Pokémon with long, powerful legs. Dodrio resembles an ostrich, and its movement is reminiscent of the roadrunner. Its name is a portmanteau of the words dodo, the extinct flightless bird, and trio, in reference to its three heads.
As the evolved form of the two-headed Doduo, Dodrio has three heads, the third head which is said to be formed by one of Doduo`s heads splitting during evolution. Each one of the heads constantly expresses a different emotion: joy, sadness, and anger. Having three heads allows Dodrio to collect more information from its surroundings, develop complex plans, and remain alert at all times by keeping watch in three different directions. On the other hand, a Dodrio`s three heads are commonly known to squabble amongst themselves, probably due to each one having a different attitude. Though Dodrio struggles to fly, it has three sets of hearts and lungs to match its heads, granting it extraordinary stamina while running at high speed. Like its pre-evolution Doduo, it inhabits dry, grassy plains.
In the video games, Dodrio are often used by Bird Keepers and Triathletes practicing in running. In Pokémon Ranger, a Dodrio is the partner of the Fall City Ranger Leader Joel. Dodrio also features in the Pokémon Stadium games as Dodrio Mode, which speeds up the games` GameBoy emulator, and in FireRed, LeafGreen, and Emerald in the mini-game Dodrio Berry-Picking.
In the Pokémon anime, Dodrio first appeared on the morning of the first episode, crowing in place of a rooster. Dario used one in the episode "The Flame Pokémon-athon," and Violet City Gym Leader Falkner battled Ash`s Pikachu with one. Gary Oak also evolved his Doduo into a Dodrio.</description>

<description>Seel are well suited to life in the most frigid reaches of the planet. They are nocturnal; in the daytime they are seen asleep on the seabed in shallow water. When hunting, Seel stay in the ocean because they cannot walk on land. Instead, they swim in a rather graceful fashion literally underneath sheets of ice floating on the water`s surface in their environment in search of their prey. Even though the air is a frigid 14 degrees Fahrenheit and the water itself is a somewhat less chilling 40 degrees, their fur hides are thick enough to insulate Seel from either degree of cold and their nostrils automatically close by themselves to ensure their ability to remain underwater. When they need to take in air, they will use their hard horns to punch holes through the ice sheet above and pop their heads out.</description>

<description>Grimer is composed primarily of putrid, hardened sludge and grime. It smells incredibly foul, and can influence the abandonment of entire cities due to its polluting nature--even weeds don`t grow where a Grimer has appeared. Grimer thrives in filthy areas, such as factories, garbage dumps, sewers and polluted water systems. It survives and matures by sucking up polluted sludge that is pumped out of factories, adding toxic waste to its already toxic girth. It enters sewers and other areas with great ease due to its rubbery and semi-viscous body; for example, it can enter barred-off areas by slipping between the narrow bars. If a person stuck his hand in a Grimer, that person would have a difficult time pulling it out from its body.</description>

<description>Muk is a living manifestation of sludge and waste. Muk thrives in toxic waste and garbage. It inhabits any polluted area; including abandoned factories, garbage dumps and sewers. It is said that its smell is comparable to that of reeking kitchen garbage, especially during hot summers. Muk itself is also a source of pollution. As Muk slides across the ground, it leaves behind a trail of highly poisonous sludge. Muk and Grimer are known for traveling into water and polluting it and killing plants with their sludge. Muk could be considered antagonistic of Suicune, a Pokémon with the ability to purify dirty or polluted water. It can also be considered antagonistic of Celebi, which can bring dead plants back to life.
In the anime, Ash and friends encounter a horde of Grimer, which is led by a Muk. After a group of Magnemits and Magnetons save them, Ash captures the Muk. When Ash first caught Muk, its smell was able to escape the Poké Ball, much to everyone`s displeasure. For this reason, Muk was given to Professor Oak. A running gag in the series involves Muk and his overly affectionate personality. He constantly expressing gratitude towards Professor Oak by hugging him, and in the process smothering him with its gooey body, he also started to do this with Professor Birch.</description>

<description>Shellder is a cheeky bivalve (oyster or clam) Pokémon; it constantly pokes its tongue out at anybody, whether friend or foe. It will also spit on foes. This tends to antagonize enemies into a rage. Its shell is very strong, apparently harder than a diamond, though only made of a single, smooth layer. Shellder becomes vulnerable when the enemy can attack its insides. When not protecting itself in battle, it will attack by squirting water at the foe. As a last resort, it will clamp the foe with its powerful shell. However, this leaves Shellder vulnerable to an attack, hence, it is rarely used. As a total last resort, Shellder may use Selfdestruct or Explosion to knock itself and the enemy out. Shellder travels by rapidly opening and closing its shell, propelling it in the opposite direction of its shell through the water. Shellder are incapable of travel on land, unless in a Poké Ball.
Shellder is integral to the evolution of Slowpoke as is the body part of Slowpoke to which Shellder bites on: its tail. Once Shellder bites the Slowpoke`s tail, the two will evolve into a single Pokémon, Slowbro. If Shellder instead attaches itself to Slowpoke`s head, it will create Slowking, a notably smarter Pokémon than the other two. This evolution can be reversed if Shellder falls off Slowbro`s tail or Slowking`s head. The evolution benefits both Pokémon: Slowpoke can now walk on its hind legs and Shellder can both eat the scraps of the Slowpoke, and finally move on land. The newly attached Shellder looks very different from its previous purple form.</description>

<description>Cloyster are bivalve Pokémon, guarded by an extremely strong, multi-layered shell. This shells cannot be opened even by those with superior strength, and they cannot be damaged even by a bomb. Nobody has seen their dark innards, which are Cloyster`s weak spot as they are very soft and vulnerable. They launch thick, powerful spikes at enemies in battle, as well as to capture prey. These spikes are even stronger than their shell. Cloyster can also crush prey by clamping their thick shell shut onto them. When being attacked, they simply shut their shells to avoid further damage. To travel through water, they swim by swallowing water and jetting it out opposite to the direction they want to move.</description>

<description>Gastly (Spirit in the Beta versions of the English language versions of Pokémon Red and Blue) is made of a very thin, gas-like substance, which grants it certain powers and weaknesses. Some say it is an other-dimensional lifeform, while others believe it is formed from toxic gas. It can sneak into any place if it so wishes thanks to the invasive properties of gas molecules. It can render itself nearly invisible and approach enemies undetected, and can envelop said enemies regardless of their size and induce sleepiness, slow poisoning through the skin, or even suffocation.
On the other hand, Gastly`s negligible weight and gaseous nature make it very easy for it to be blown off or even scattered to nothingness under a strong wind (although it is presumed the molecules can regroup later). A Gastly will not appear in windy weather if it can help it, but when it finds itself threatened by a strong wind, it clusters in groups under the eaves of houses to protect itself.</description>

However, when approached by people, it has a habit of reverting to a spherical form that obscures its eyes, mouth, and hands. Haunter is considered in the Pokédex to be a `gas type` Pokémon, because of the overall structure of his body. Because of its ability to slip through block walls, Haunter is said to be from another dimension. They seem to eat by first paralyzing their opponent with Lick, then draining a bit of their life force, although it`s possible they may eat other food as well, such things like Pokéblocks. It is also said to eat people`s dreams by going inside them and scaring them to death. It is the lightest of all discovered pokemon.</description>

<description>Gengar is a dual-type Ghost/Poison Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Haunter when traded. It is the final form of Gastly. It can Mega Evolve into Mega Gengar using the Gengarite. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Gengar is a dark purple, bipedal Pokémon with a roundish body. It has red eyes, a wide mouth that is usually curled into a sinister grin, and pointed ears. On its back are numerous spikes and it has smaller spikes on top of its head similar to tufty fur. Its arms and legs are short with three digits on both its hands and feet. It also has a stubby tail.
Gengar has the ability to hide perfectly in the shadow of any object, granting it exceptional stealth. However, Gengar`s body acts as a heat sink. Its presence cools the temperature of the surrounding area by nearly 10°F (5°C), because it absorbs the warmth. The anime has shown that Gengar can fly and possess people and other Pokémon. In the past, Night Shade was its signature move.
Gengar is very mischievous, and at times, malicious. It enjoys playing practical jokes and casting curses, such as pretending to be one`s shadow, then behaving erratically. When the quarry notices, the Gengar takes delight in its victim`s terror. However, Gengar has been known to be loyal to a Trainer who treats it well. Being the result of an evolution via trading, Gengar is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in caves and dark places where shadows form. It is especially fond of urban areas such as cities and back alleys, but only during the night.
As Mega Gengar, a portion of its body sinks into the ground and its arms and tail lengthen. The lower portions turn a more reddish purple, and a third eye appears on its forehead. This new unblinking eye is oval, yellow, and allows it to see into other dimensions. The spikes on Mega Gengar`s back are more numerous and pointed and additional spikes appear on its hands and tail. Its ears are now considerably longer and tilt backward.
Mega Gengar has the ability to access other dimensions and has a vicious nature. Mega Gengar has no itnerests in opponents unless perceived as prey. Its relationships are warped due to Mega Evolution. It now desires to take the life and curse anyone or anything in its path It may even curse its own Trainer. Mega Gengar sinks into an another dimension to wait for a chance to attack.
As Gigantamax Genger, it becomes larger with portions of its body sinking into ground. Only the head, tail, and arms remain. Also it changes to from a dark purple to lighter purple. The eyes change to the color white with yellow sclera. The inside of the mouth changes to resemble a tunnel with a long purple tounge sticking out. Three red clouds surrounds the top of Gengar’s head.
There’s a rumor where Gigantamax Gengar’s mouth does not lead into its body. Due the cursed energy, it’s believed to instead lead into the afterlife. By laying a trap, it hope to steal the lives of those it captures. Should someone stand near its mouth, they can hear the voices of their loved ones calling out to them.
Gigantamax Gengar is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Terror.</description>

<description>Onix is a subterranean creature that bores its way through the ground at a rate of 50 mph (80 km/h) in search of food. The tunnels it leaves behind as it burrows through the earth are used as pre-dug homes by other subterranean Pokémon such as Diglett and Geodude. Within Onyx`s member is a structure nigh identical to a magnet, which allows it to determine its heading, its depth underground, and other such information useful for a subterranean Pokémon to know. It acts quite like a compass. As Onix ages, it burrows deeper underground, and its rocky member becomes progressively harder, rounder, and smoother. Around the age of 100, the pressures exerted on its stone member become so high that it is compressed into a much harder, diamond-like composition, although it is closer to metal in nature.
In the anime, an Onix is owned by Brock as part of the many Pokemon owned by the training gym that Brock`s family runs. Brock had initially received the Onix from his father, who is a specialist in rock-type Pokemon. When Brock feels the need to travel with Ash Ketchum yet again, he entrusts the care of the Onix to one of his many younger brothers. This takes place in Pokémon Chronicles. It eventually evolves into a Steelix.</description>

<description>Drowzee is a creature with an elephant`s trunk, the body and color pattern of a tapir, and a hunger for dreams, traits that characterize Drowzee. Its name comes from the English word "drowsy", which reflects on the fact that Drowzee`s primary ability is to put foes to sleep. The "-zee" comes from the sleeping phrase "ZzZzZ". Its Japanese name, Sleepe, is a corruption of the English word sleep. Drowzee`s original biology was based on the tapir and its appearance and dream-eating behavior are inspired by the Japanese folkloric creature Baku. However, its nature is much unlike the real-world animal it was based on.
Drowzee eats dreams; in order to eat, it must put its prey to sleep. A nightmare or night terror will give it indigestion, and it prefers the dreams of human children to those of adults or other pokémon. It`s psychic, but it has limited abilities, compared to other Pokémon; it does not display telekinesis, for example. However, its telepathy allows it to detect people who are asleep, even while asleep itself. Its memory when it comes to dreams is eidetic, and it has the ability to show anyone any dream it has eaten. If one thinks he/she had a good dream, but is unable to remember it, it was possibly eaten by a Drowzee.</description>

<description>Hypno is a humanoid creature with a fur covering its neck, and always carrying its favorite pendulum in its hand, which it uses to put others to sleep. The name "Hypno" originates from the word "hypnosis", as Hypno hypnotizes foes with its pendulum.
Hypno is a curiously sinister Pokémon that puts other Pokémon and people to sleep. It does so by swinging the pendulum, which it carries in its hand all the time. When hunting for prey, it will polish the mysterious pendulum.
Eating the dreams of its foes is another sinister ability of Hypno. However, stomach pains will ail Hypno if it eats a nightmare. At dusk, some Hypno will appear near schools and less-traveled roads. This may be to scare children and travelers at night and hypnotize them. In fact, there was once an incident where Hypno hypnotized and kidnapped a child.
It is possible that Hypno never sleeps, as evident by its Insomnia ability. Instead of sleeping, it probably energizes itself with meditation and by eating the dreams of those it puts to sleep. Hypno`s menacing and semi-parted eyelids look sleep deprived.</description>

<description>Krabby is a crab with large pincers. Krabby is an omnivore and a scavenger; it rarely hunts for itself. It can also act as a filter feeder by digesting the bacteria in sand, but this is rare. It is territorial, and in beaches where there is little food, fights between Krabby are common. Krabby also uses camouflage; it can form mucus sacs about itself if threatened, making it seem larger or making it harder to spot against sea sand. It is usually very small, but it makes up by its aggressiveness.
Krabby first appeared at a beach in episode 13, Mystery At The Lighthouse, when Ash Ketchum wanted to prove that he could catch a Pokémon alone. After the capture (which involved Krabby attacking Ash`s finger), it was automatically transferred to Professor Oak`s lab, because Ash already had six Pokémon with him. To Ash`s great surprise, Gary had also caught another Krabby, which was much larger than his. Ash used Krabby in his first battle at the Indigo Tournament. Krabby won against an Exeggutor and evolved into Kingler, despite the fact that Krabby had never battled before.</description>

<description>Kingler is a Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Krabby starting at level 28. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Kingler is a crustacean Pokémon resembling a crab. Its strong shell covers the outside of its body, featuring a red upper half and a light tan lower half. Its upper half is topped with six tall, thin spikes that resemble a crown. Its light tan arms are also connected to its upper body. Its lower half doubles as its jaw with six fangs overlapping its upper body. Its two outer fangs are much larger than the inner four and are roughly half as tall as Kingler`s entire body. Its hips visibly protrude from its lower body and connect to its four long, thin legs. Each leg has a single, claw-like foot. Kingler`s main feature is its red pincers. Its left claw is roughly twice as large as the other and hard as steel.
Kingler is often found on the edges of water, usually the ocean. It its powerful claws have 10,000 horsepower and are capable of prying open the shells of Shellder and Cloyster. While Kingler`s large, left claw is its main tool for offensive maneuvers, it is so large and heavy that Kingler can barely lift it. It causes balancing problems and Kingler may quickly become fatigued from continuous use. However, it has been shown to communicate with other Kingler by waving its pincers around. In the past, Crabhammer was its signature move.
Gigantamax Kingler is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Foam Burst.</description>

<description>Voltorb are aggressive red and white ball shaped Pokémon that looks strikingly similar to a Poké Ball. Coincidently it was discovered shortly after Poké Balls were invented, some believe there is a connection. Though roughly ten times larger, many trainers get a surprise when they pick one up thinking it is a Poké Ball. The strength of their explosions is dependent on how much electricity they store in their bodies. When jarred or angered, a Voltorb can and will explode, causing massive damage to their aggressor and themselves (as seen in the video games when they use the moves `Self-Destruct` or `Explosion`, both of which causes fainting to the user). It is so unstable that even the slightest bump in the road will make it explode spontaneously. Voltorb do not have a mouth, but do have two eyes that are normally slanted into an aggressive or angry stare.</description>

It instead uses its stored electric to increase its rolling speed. The amount of electricity in an Electrode is relative to how powerful its explosions are. The stored energy also generates strong static electricity around Electrode`s body, sometimes paralyzing enemies on contact. If it is bored, it often amuses itself by exploding.

They use telepathic signals only they can receive to remain in their balanced formation; even if one is separated, it will quickly rejoin its swarm. Each member of the swarm have a different appearance in number of cracks, deformations, personalities and expression. Some Exeggcute can have such severe cracking and breakage that a Yolk can be seen inside. The middle body often has the fewest or no cracks at all, and is assumed to be the boss of the group.</description>

<description>Exeggutor`s name is believed to be derived from the name of its previous evolutionary stage (Exeggcute), whose name is derived from egg and the word execute so Exeggutor`s name is a combination of egg and executor.

The heads are considered fruit or nuts and each has a different expression on its face similar to Exeggcute. When an Exeggcute evolves into Exeggutor, any and all cracks and breaks are mended as they turn yellow and combine to form the new Exeggutor. Living in a good environment will allow it to grow lots of heads, and it is said that they occasionally fall off to form new Exeggcute.</description>

Its Japanese name is most likely a pun on 空 kara (emptiness), 殻 kara (shell), and/or からから karakara (dried-up). In the Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow a Cubone is adopted by Mr. Fuji after its mother is killed by Team Rocket. Cubone is also a playable character in Pokémon Red Rescue Team and Pokémon Blue Rescue Team. The skull a Cubone wears on its head is said to be the skull of its mother, who dies whenever a Cubone is born. Because it never removes its skull helmet, no one has ever seen a Cubone`s actual face. Its cries for its mother are often heard echoing inside the skull.</description>

Any punch or hand based moves bred into or learned by a Tyrogue will carry into either of its evolved forms. This means that even a Hitmonlee can be taught punching moves, such as Mach Punch and Fire Punch.</description>

Hitmonchan`s name is a combination of hit (suggesting its role as a martial arts pokémon), mon (a common abbreviation for `monster` in various collectible monster games -- such as Digimon and Pokémon), and chan (an allusion to actor and martial artist Jackie Chan). Its Japanese name is a reference to world champion boxer Hiroyuki Ebihara. Hitmonchan Have two natural Boxing Glove shaped hands as well as a training clothes. Unlike Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan have heads with spiky ridges similar to that of Tyrogue. Any kick or foot based moves breed into or learned by a Tyrogue will carry into either of its evolved forms. This means that even a Hitmonchan can know a move like High Jump Kick or Rapid Spin.</description>

<description>Koffing is a Poison Type Pokémon that evolved into Weezing. Koffing is a spelling variant of coughing, one of the reactions experienced when in proximity of Koffing`s noxious gases. The Japanese name uses the English loanword "gas" (which is used by Japanese to refer to both gasoline and the state of matter), with the prefix "do" meaning "bad" or "poisonous". Koffing are often found near abandoned buildings (burned out preferred), Caves and Volcanic rich environments. Koffing spew gases from their crater like ridges that cover their body. Koffing have a Cyclops like Skull and Cross Bones symbol on their chest and stomach. The Skull has three teeth detailed on it. Koffing have two small fangs protruding from the top of its mouth. Koffing often have a jolly or spaced out expression on their face while looking up. James from Team Rocket used a Koffing until it evolved into a Weezing. In Pokémon Snap, Koffings can be seen following Jigglypuffs around causing Jigglypuff discomfort. Koffing is also one of the Pokémon signs as well as a star constellation in the game.</description>

<description>Weezing is a Poison-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Koffing starting at level 35.
In Galar, Weezing has a Poison/Fairy-type regional form. It evolves from Koffing starting at level 35. All Koffing in Galar evolve into this form regardless of their origin.
Weezing is a purple Pokémon consisting of two spherical heads connected by a thin tube with another sphere in the center. The heads have differing sizes and features. The left head is larger and has prominent eyebrows, pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw, and two flat teeth in its upper jaw. The smaller, right head simply has two pointed teeth, one at each corner of its mouth. The larger head has a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking below its face, while the smaller head has a ring marking instead. It is covered with many geyser-like protrusions, which usually expel mustard-colored gases. Weezing is said to form when poisonous gases pool and two Koffing fuse over many years. Very rarely, two Koffing can become a Weezing in a short timespan because of a sudden mutation. Triplet Weezing have been discovered, although they are extremely rare.
Each of Weezing`s heads contains a different toxin. It mixes its gases by inflating one head and deflating the other. When its gases mix, Weezing becomes more toxic and putrid. Weezing can hover in midair, presumably due to gases lighter than air, as is the case for Koffing. Despite their stench and poison, Weezing`s gases can be used to make top-grade perfume by diluting them to the highest level.
Weezing lives in urban areas. It seeks a dirty, unkempt house and nests there. At night, when the people in the house are asleep, it will go through the trash. Weezing feeds on the dust, microorganisms, and especially gases emitted by garbage and toxic waste. Weezing`s body expands and smells worse upon inhaling poisonous gases. The Kantoian Weezing used to be common in Galar and created more potent toxins than their Galarian relatives.
In the Galar region, its appearance has changed due to absorbing polluted air from factories. It has a grey body with with the skull, crossbones, and ring changed to color yellow. Both heads have a hat-like tube located on top of them that constantly release purified air. Five green puffs of poison gas clouds can be seen floating around it. The larger head has a cloud-like mustache, while the smaller has clouds on its face in the shape of eyebrows and a beard.
Galrian Weezing consumes particles from the polluted air. It expels clean air instead of droppings. The toxins within Weezing`s body are accumulated into poison gas clouds that leaks and drifts around it. The gas is Weezing`s best weapon in battle, being potent enough to stun and immobilize an opponent with just a whiff.
Galarian Weezing is the only known Pokémon capable of using the the move Strange Steam.</description>

<description>Rhyhorn is a rhinoceros like Pokemon with a rock like hide consisting of plates. Ryhorn stands on all four legs and evolves into Rhydon. Rhyhorn is a portmanteau of rhinoceros (which it resembles) and horn. Its spelling is also influenced by the rock rhyolite. Its Japanese name is a portmanteau of sai (犀), meaning rhinoceros and horn (ホーン). Rhyhorn are easily angered and will not hesitate to charge at what ever or who ever angered it. Rhyhorn are powerful enough to topple buildings with their tackle. Rhyhorn are prime examples of "more brawn than brains", as they often charge head first into things but forget why. In Gold, Silver, and Crystal, Brock uses a Rhyhorn to battle. There is also a Rhyhorn in the Brock Gym Leader set of the trading card game.</description>

<description>Rhydon appears to be a cross between a rhinoceros and a dinosaur. It is a massive, gray, bipedal creature with clawed forepaws and hindfeet and a long tail. Rhydon`s head has two horns: one is on its forehead, and another one at the end of its snout. The latter is bigger and seems to be styled after a drill. After the production of Pokémon Diamond/Pearl, it is revealed that the male Rhydon has a longer drill horn than the female.
Rhydon`s brain is considerably more developed than that of its pre-evolved form Rhyhorn, which allows it to exhibit some signs of advanced intelligence, including the ability to stand upright and walk on two legs. It is capable of living in molten lava under the ground.
Rhydon is notable for being one of the very few non-water rock type Pokémon to learn the move surf.</description>

Chansey gives their eggs to injured people and Pokémon, and are known to be delicious. Chansey are rare and few in number outside of a Pokémon Center. In the Anime it is revealed that Chansey attend a nursing school. Jessie of Team Rocket was not accepted into the same school as Nurse Joys, and was forced to attend a Chansey nursing school where she became friends with a Chansey. Chansey is the best pokemon ever!
Chansey is the evolved form of Happiny and the pre-evolved form of Blissey</description>

If a vine is lost or damaged it will grow back the next day. The vines always jiggle, which easily unnerves its foes.</description>

<description>"Gold-" refers to the fact that it resembles a goldfish. The "-een" is most likely "queen," but it is possible that it is a simple feminine suffix (misspelling of "-ine"). The Japanese name plays on tosakin (土佐金), which is a kind of goldfish. In the original Beta version, it was known as Goldy. Goldeen evolves into Seaking at lvl33.It is considered to be one of the most beautiful Pokémon in the world. Its sharp horn can do serious damage, but it can`t fight on land.

<description>Seaking is a goldfish Pokemon. The "sea" in Seaking`s name refers to the fact that it is a water-inhabiting Pokemon. "King" is probably a reference to its unevolved form`s name, Goldeen (a portmanteau of "gold" and "queen"). Hence, its name means "king of the sea." Its Japanese name refers to Azumanishiki (東錦) for one kind of "goldfish" and Ou (王) for "king". Seaking was originally called Neptune in the beta. Seaking is a goldfish Pokemon with a sharp horn, much like a narwhal. It uses the horn for boring holes in a rock for its nest. In spawning season, they can be seen swimming up rivers and streams.</description>

<description>Starmie is an aquatic starfish Pokémon that evolves from Staryu through use of a Water Stone. It moves through the water by spinning its star-shaped body in a manner like that of a propeller. It consists of two five-point, purple star-shaped structures superimposed on top of each other. At its center is a large gem, surrounded by a golden crest like structure. Starmie`s center section - the gem - is known as its "core". This gem is considered very valuable among collectors. The gem`s hue can change to any color in the visual spectrum, earning Starmie the nickname "the gem of the sea". When Starmie is weak, the core grows dim and starts flickering whilst producing distinctive warning sounds.
In the Pokémon world, the aforementioned peculiar properties of Starmie`s anatomy leads some people to theorize that Starmie`s origins are not of this planet, and that its luminescent core is used to send electromagnetic signals into outer space. It may have some connection with Deoxys having a similar core and the ability to regenerate. In ancient times, Starmie was attributed an equally mystical origin: that it was created from the reflection of the stars upon the waves at night.
In the anime, Starmie is one of the Pokémon used in Misty`s team during the most of the Kanto arc, along with its pre-evolved form, Staryu. Misty also often used Starmie outside of battle for transportation through water or for fire-fighting purposes. Misty eventually left Starmie in the care of her sisters at the Cerulean City Gym, and later reobtained it upon her return.</description>

<description>Mr. Mime is a dual-type Psychic/Fairy Pokémon introduced in Generation I. Prior to Generation VI, it was a pure Psychic-type Pokémon.
It evolves from Mime Jr. when leveled up while knowing Mimic.
In Galar, Mr. Mime has an Ice/Psychic-type regional form. It evolves into Mr. Rime starting at level 42. All Mime Jr. in Galar evolve into this form regardless of their origin.
Mr. Mime is a bipedal, humanoid Pokémon. Blue growths resembling clown hair extend from the sides of its pale pink head, and there is a magenta circle on each cheek. Its jaw is curved inward, resembling the mouth of a wooden dummy. It has a round, white body with a magenta spot in the middle, light pink arms and legs that connect to its body via magenta spheres, and small white coverings over its knees. Its white hands resemble gloves with magenta pads on the tips of its white fingers and its dark blue feet curl upward at the tips.
From birth, this Pokémon is an excellent pantomime. As it matures, it gains the ability to solidify air molecules by vibrating its fingertips. This ability allows it to create invisible objects with its gestures. It punishes those who interrupt its act or are not impressed by slapping them. Mr. Mime is usually very rare, but can be found in suburban areas. In the past, Substitute was its signature move.
Galarian Mr. Mime are mostly blue and white. Much like other Mr. Mime they also have blue growths resembling clown hair, however, these also extend and cover its cheeks. They have wider-shaped eyes then other Mr. Mime and they have a blue nose. Their bodies have a white top and a blue bottom and they have a diamond made of ice that resembles a tie. They have blue shoulder spheres, but lack these spheres on their legs. Unlike other Mr. Mime, Galarian Mr. Mime do not have defined fingers and instead have mitten-like hands. Their feet are more defined, resembling blue shoes with light blue soles, presumably made out of ice. Rather than miming, Galarian Mr. Mime`s main talent is tap dancing. Their feet radiate chilliness and can be used to create a floor of ice, which they can kick up to act as a barrier.</description>

<description>Scyther is a mantis Pokémon. Its English name was originally going to be Stryke, as revealed in the 1999 Nintendo Official Magazine Pokémon Special #2. Scyther`s most impressive feature is its scythe-like arms that can easily cut through metal. Scyther is also noted for its agility. While hunting in the wild or in a battle between trainers, it relies on its speed to strike quickly and to avoid being struck in return by its foe. Its high-supernatural speed can make it seem to be in more than one place at once, or to seem invisible as it moves in, strikes, and leaves the opponent before he can feel the blow. Scyther`s wings are capable of flight, but this is rare; it is not a fast or an agile flier, and it is a better hunter on its own feet.
In the anime, Tracey Sketchit catches a Scyther in the Orange Islands. It is aged and was recently removed from its clan by a younger, stronger Scyther. The bug Pokémon reconcile their differences through the interference of Team Rocket, and Tracey`s Scyther is allowed to leave with him with its conflicts fully resolved. Tracey`s Scyther is incredibly strong-willed, preferring to keep watch over the travellers while they sleep, as opposed to staying in its Poké Ball.
In the episode "Showdown at Dark City", two gangs were fighting in a dusty town. The leader of one team had an Electabuzz while the other had a Scyther. When Ash poured ketchup barrels on both Pokémon, they locked into each other in a death grip, meaning that Scyther and Electabuzz are possibly provoked by the color red.</description>

<description>Jynx is a humanoid Pokémon. Jynx walks in a dance-like fashion, wiggling its hips in a seductive manner. Its bouncing motions are alluring enough so that any person seeing it feels compelled to copy the motion. Jynx is known for its smooching habit, which it actually uses as a battling tool. A Jynx usually gives a sleep or confusion-inducing kiss to its opponents, using its signature attack, "Lovely Kiss." Jynx vocalizes a mysterious language, similar to that of humans, understood only by other Jynx, and no human or other Pokémon is able to understand it.
In 2000, children`s book author Carole Boston Weatherford published an article complaining that Jynx`s original design bore a striking resemblance to blackface actors, an image from America`s past that is now considered racist. An episode of Pokemon portrayed this, The Ice Cave. She has described the Pokémon as "a dead ringer for an obese drag queen," In response to this controversy, in 2000 Nintendo changed Jynx`s face from black to purple and its hands from blue to purple in localized versions, a change which would be reflected several years later in the Japanese versions of the games and the Advanced Generation anime series. The newly-redesigned Jynx has white arms instead of red arms.</description>

<description>Since Electabuzz is electric, he feeds on electrical currents. Its methods of securing its food vary: during thunderstorms, an Electabuzz climbs to the highest place possible, in hopes that it will be struck by lightning. As a result, many towns in the Pokémon world employ an Electabuzz in lieu of a lightning rod. Electabuzz also lurk around power plants, feeding off the electricity generated there. This behavior is dangerous to the public, as occasionally blackouts are caused by an Electabuzz overindulging itself at a power plant, or worse, walking down to a city and drawing electricity from there.
Due to its unique diet, Electabuzz`s body is constantly discharging stored electricity, to the point that it glows whitish blue in darkness and static electricity effects manifest. An Electabuzz can control the electric current coursing in its body to communicate with other Electric-type Pokémon, especially with another Electabuzz. It originally is lone in its evolutionary line, but it gains a previous form, Elekid, in Pokémon Gold and Silver, and an evolution, Electivire, in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.
Like Scyther, as seen in the anime, Electabuzz is most likely provoked by the color red.</description>

<description>Magmar is born in the proximity of an active volcano, and if possible it spends its entire life there, or at least in a place hot enough to sustain its body temperature of 3,300 degrees Fahrenheit. If a Magmar finds itself in a cold place, it will try to make it more habitable by blowing scorching flames around. It has the ability to expel orange-colored fire from every part of its body, including its mouth. This serves both offensive and defensive purposes: a Magmar cloaked in flames resembles a big ball of fire. Together with its matching body coloration, Magmar can quite easily hide itself among flames, escaping detection. If Magmar is actually wounded, it can heal itself by dipping its wound(s) in lava. When it emerges, damp soil clings onto its body. In Gold and Silver, Magmar gets a pre-evolution, Magby, and in Diamond and Pearl, an evolution, Magmortar.
Magmar has appeared in the anime owned by various people but the ones of note are the Gym Leader Blaine, Ash`s now ex-rival, Gary Oak, and his new rival, Paul. Paul had been looking for a new fire Pokémon since the release of Chimchar in "Glory Blaze" and captured Magmar sometime between capturing Gliscor in ""Gliscor and Gligar: Getting Through the Wind Maze" and his Gym Battle, with Maylene which was shown as a flashback in "Lucario and the Aura Sphere of Rage."</description>

<description>Tauros is a bull known for its violent urges and rowdy, aggressive disposition in general, as supplied by a tremendous amount of natural stamina. Any given Tauros finds it impossible to keep up its spirits in life without near-constant rampaging. It always tries to find opponent Pokémon to battle outright to serve this purpose, but if it is alone, it will instead concentrate on charging at and knocking down thick trees to calm itself. By locking horns with other Tauros, it fights to assert dominance in a herd. The protector of the herd is usually noted by battle torn horns. As Tauros is based on a bull, it is a male-only Pokémon; its female equivalent is the more cowlike Miltank.
Tauros has a special habit that specifically affects its ability to battle, both in the wild and in trainer-directed Pokémon battles: It whips itself with its three long snapping tails. When it targets an enemy, it heightens its will to battle by whipping its own backside with its tails before charging at full speed.
In the anime, Ash Ketchum captures a herd of thirty Tauros in the Safari Zone (though the episode which features this was banned in America due to its flagrant gun use and politically incorrect humor). They usually remain in Professor Oak`s fields, Ash occasionally picks one up for various tournaments or important battles.</description>

<description>Magikarp is a commonly found Pokémon that can survive in rivers, lakes,and oceans. Despite its adaptability, the Pokédex states that the Magikarp species has grown weaker over time, and it is one of the least viable for battling in the series. It eventually evolves into another, far more powerful Pokémon, Gyarados.
Magikarp is commonly thought of as the weakest Pokémon. They are only able to learn three moves: Splash (does absolutely nothing), Tackle (a weak attack), and Flail (which does more damage as Magikarp is more damaged.)
In the anime, Magikarp has appeared several times, most notably as the subject of a running gag in which a salesman attempts to trick Team Rocket into buying Magikarp in various guises. (This man also appears in Pokémon Red, Blue, Yellow, FireRed, and LeafGreen.) Team Rocket later adopted a Magikarp-shaped submarine.
Magikarp also appear many times in the video games. They can be found in almost any pond, river, lake, or sea. Many trainers have them, along with other weak Water Pokémon like Goldeen or Horsea. In Pokémon Pearl, one trainer named "Ander," found outside Lake Valor, possesses a Magikarp whose move "Quake" replaces the normal Magikarp`s equally useless "Splash".</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Gyarados is the evolved form of Magikarp. It is a dramatically large change from Magikarp, going from a small fish to a long draconic, serpentine body. Gyarados tend to be very aggressive, and are powerful enough to destroy entire cities. They have a reputation for appearing where there is conflict, and shrivelling everything up with the Hyper Beam attack. Rampages like this have been known to last upwards of an entire month, and will not end until everything around them has been destroyed. Because they have been known to sink ships as well through the seastorms their rage causes, they are considered legendary among sailors, especially the red/ golden variety. Its big change in behavior is said to be attributed to a structural change occurring in its brain while evolving from Magikarp.
In the beta version of Pokémon Red and Green, Gyarados had the name of Skullkraken.
Shiny Gyarados is a particularly rare variety of Gyarados. While Gyarados are normally blue in color, there are some rare red/ gold scaled Gyarados. Though no more powerful than their more common blue counterparts, red Gyarados are valued for their rarity and individuality. This is caused in Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal and the anime by a radio frequency transmitted by Team Rocket to force the Magikarp to evolve. The red coloration comes from the Magikarp evolving prematurely, and not undergoing the conversion from red to blue scale pigment. Thus, they retain the same color they had as a Magikarp. Red Gyarados are more commonly called Shiny Gyarados, or even Golden Gyarados due to the contrasting coloration.
In Generation II Pokémon games, a red Gyarados at the Lake of Rage is a main part of the plot. After its defeat or capture, a Red Scale is obtained, which can be given to Mr. Pokémon, or Marcus Spanier, in exchange for an Exp. Share. The red Gyarados is the only Pokémon in the Generation II games that will be shiny without fail.
In the anime, one is owned by Misty. At first, she fearfully dislikes Gyarados due to a traumatic experience, but manages to get over the fear, take over the Cerulean City Gym, and add one to her team. The red Gyarados in the anime is caught by Lance, the dragon trainer, to rescue it from Team Rocket. Team Rocket also uses a Gyarados-shaped submarine in early episodes, but trades it for a Magikarp-shaped submarine in later episodes.
Gyarados was noticeably larger in the Indigo Series, but has since become a lot smaller. Gyarados` most powerful attack is said to be Dragon Rage (however, this is not true in the games, given that Dragon Rage only ever does 40 damage), where many other Gyarados appear around the main Gyarados, then they start spinning around at such a speed they became one huge tornado, as seen in Episode #18: Island of The Giant Pokémon.</description>

<description>Lapras is a dual-type Water/Ice Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, it has a Gigantamax form.
Lapras is a large sea Pokémon that resembles a plesiosaur. It has a blue hide with darker blue spots and a cream-colored underside. It has large brown eyes, a short horn on its forehead, and tightly curled ears. It has a long neck and four flippers. The foremost flippers are larger than the hind. On its back is a heavy, gray shell covered in blunt knobs.
Lapras is a gentle, helpful Pokémon that enjoys ferrying people across bodies of water. In the past, its docility made it an easy target for hunters, and it was driven to near-extinction. Recent protection efforts have seen Lapras become overabundant instead, which is now affecting the fish Pokémon numbers in some areas. An intelligent Pokémon, it is able to understand human speech. Lapras have been known to travel in large pods across the seas, spanning both polar and tropical areas. To keep in touch with other of its kind, it sings enchanting melodies. In the anime it was shown that Lapras is able to develop psychic abilities such as telepathy.
As Gigantamax Lapras, it becomes larger in size and more armored. Its shell resembles a cruise ship with four gray and red stripes surrounding it, and it has four spikes on top of its shell with one steel spike resembling a funnel, which has three red clouds surrounding it. The sclera in Lapras` eyes change colors to white, yellow, and blue. A light blue ring of fine thin lines resembling a musical sheet created from ice particles circles around its shell.
5,000 people can ride on the shell of Gigantamax Lapras for a very comfortable ride without any issues. Lapras can use it giant ring to break any icebergs that may prevent it from swimming.
Gigantamax Lapras is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Resonance.</description>

<description>Ditto has the form of an amorphous blob with a simplistic face. Ditto is purple and is able to rearrange its cellular structure into anything at will, but it usually changes into another Pokémon nearby. It takes on the exact form of the Pokémon and can use all of its abilities. The only things that can make it change back are being defeated and the Ditto laughing. During the night, it transforms into a rock to avoid being attacked. If it tries to transform from memory, or if it is inexperienced, it will likely mess up on certain details such as leaving its own face or staying its own size. The only other Pokémon capable of transforming is the legendary Pokémon Mew.
In the games, with the exception of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, it takes on the type and attacks of its opponent, but each attack has 5 PP. However in a battle between two dittos when it transforms its pp is reset to 5. Being its only move this forms an continual loop. It can also breed with any Pokémon that is capable of breeding, including genderless Pokémon such as Staryu or Porygon. In the anime, two Ditto are owned by Duplica, a girl who can easily imitate people. The first Ditto is used to help her run a theater. At first it cannot correctly transform its face, but with the help of Team Rocket, it overcomes that barrier. The second Ditto, "Mini-Dit", cannot change its size at all.
In Mystery Dungeon Red and Blue Rescue Team, when Ditto transforms it cannot copy any of the transformed Pokémon moves. Therefore it has only 2 attack choices -- use the attack unique to Mystery Dungeon, or use Struggle.</description>

<description>Eevee is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves into one of eight different Pokémon through various methods. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Eevee is the game mascot and starter Pokémon in Pokémon: Let`s Go, Eevee!, as well as for the main characters of Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness and Pokémon Conquest. It is also the rival`s starter Pokémon in Pokémon Yellow, although Professor Oak originally intended to give it to the player.
Eevee is a mammalian, quadruped Pokémon with primarily brown fur. The tip of its bushy tail and its large furry collar are cream-colored. It has short, slender legs with three small toes and a pink paw pad on each foot. Eevee has brown eyes, long pointed ears with dark brown interiors, and a small black nose. Eevee is rarely found in the wild and is mostly only found in cities and towns. However, Eevee is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure that is easily influenced by its environment. This allows it to adapt to a variety of habitats by evolving. Eevee is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Extreme Evoboost.
In Pokémon: Let`s Go, Eevee!, the player starts with a special Eevee known as a Partner Eevee. The Partner Eevee has purple eyes and a lighter shade of fur. These design elements likely taken from the anime, which implemented similar traits starting in the Advanced Generation series. The marking on the tip of a female Partner Eevee is heart-shaped. Before Pokémon Sword and Shield, this trait was unique and wasn`t found on other female Eevee. Partner Eevee has higher base stats and access to moves that normal Eevee do not. Partner Eevee is the only Pokémon capable of performing Bouncy Bubble, Buzzy Buzz, Sizzly Slide, Glitzy Glow, Baddy Bad, Sappy Seed, Freezy Frost, Sparkly Swirl, and the Partner Power, Veevee Volley. In Pokémon Sword and Shield, the unique pattern is present on all female Eevee as a true gender difference.
As Gigantamax Eevee, it has become larger and more fluffy. The fur collar becomes longer with several triangular furs pointing straight up. The right ear has three red clouds surrounding it like a circle. Due to the fur becoming fluffier and luxurious, any enemies caught in it will lose the will to fight due to being enamored by its presence. Due to Gigantamaxing, Eevee becomes even more playful and rambunctious, desiring to play with its opponent and often unintentionally crushing them with its size.
Gigantamax Eevee is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Cuddle.</description>

<description>Vaporeon is one of the evolutions of Eevee that is caused by radiation from a water stone. Upon evolving, it gains fins and gills that give it the ability to live underwater. It has small scales that are hard to see. Its finned tail is similar to a mermaid`s, so it is often mistaken for one. Vaporeon`s cells are similar in structure to water molecules, and this allows it to have a unique control over the water around it. This includes being able to transform itself into liquid as a form of camouflage (this being portrayed in the games as its ability to learn the attack Acid Armor), and detect rain through subtle vibrations in its fins. Its base scale color is aqua with darker aqua that makes a line along the spine from the tail to the neck where it forms into a base for its white frill. A darker-aqua patch on the head is similar in shape to a diving cap, and upon the head are three yellow fins, two resembling ears, and the middle one, a Dorsal fin. Its ability is `Water Absorb`, which allows it to gain HP when struck with a water type move.</description>

<description>Jolteon is one of the evolutions of Eevee that is caused by radiation from a thunder stone. Jolteon is covered with spiky, bright yellow fur, with white spiky fur surrounding its neck. Its fur sparks with electricity constantly; it can be soft to the touch or turn into sharp needles that can be fired when it is angered. Jolteon is able to gather negative ions from the atmosphere, using the resulting electricity to create lightning bolts of up to 10,000 volts. Its individual cells also create small electrical charges on their own, which combined with the static electricity caused by its body can result in powerful electric-type attacks. It`s very sensitive which causes it to constantly charge as it quickly changes moods. It can also make lightning and cause small thunderstorms. In the Pokémon video games, Jolteon can absorb electric attacks and turn them into HP (Health Point, or Health) with the ability `Volt Absorb`.</description>

<description>Flareon is one of the evolutions of Eevee that is caused by exposure to a Fire Stone. It has a red body and thick, yellow fur on its face, head, neck, and tail. Its ears are as long as the Jolteon`s. It stores thermal energy from the sun, causing its body temperature to skyrocket to more than a range of 1600 degrees Celsius, releasing its flames from an internal sack. Its ability is `Flash Fire` which negates fire-type moves against it and increases its attack by 1.5 times damage if hit by a damaging fire attack.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Porygon is the first man-made Pokemon, the product of extensive research by Silph Co. It consists entirely of programming code, allowing it to convert itself entirely back to program data. This allows it to move freely in cyberspace. This code is copy protected in order to prevent duplication. This code is fairly restrictive, limiting Porygon to certain pre-programmed motions, actions, and reactions. As it does not need to breathe, it is used in various environments, even some normally considered inhospitable.
In the Pokemon world, Porygon is only available as a prize from slot machines. As a result, a large number of people have taken to playing the slots seeking to win a Porygon. These gamblers are especially visible in the towns of Kanto and Johto. Porygon are not available in Hoenn at all. However, Porygon actually run wild in Sinnoh. Porygon is cheaper to obtain in some Pokémon versions than in others.
Porygon`s most significant appearance in the Pokemon Anime to date is Dennou Senshi Porygon, an episode notorious for having caused hundreds of children to have epileptic seizures during its broadcast in Japan. Even though Pikachu caused the `seizure attack`, it was Porygon (and its evolved forms) who were banned from the Pokemon anime. Aside from that, Porygon has had only a few minor cameo appearances.</description>

<description>Omanyte is a prehistoric Pokémon that is long extinct. Some can be revived using helix fossils, and a small number have been shown to be in deep hibernation. It lives in the deep in the primordial sea where it navigates by twisting its ten tentacles, and uses air in its shell to rise and sink. It eats plankton off of the sea floor, and withdraws into its shell to escape harm. Omanyte is based on the ammonite a creature which resembles it, and sounds similar in name.</description>

<description>Omastar is the evolution of Omanyte. Omastar went extinct due to its heavy shell making it too sluggish to capture prey despite the fact that its ability is "swift swim". When it does capture prey, it uses its tentacles, which developed similarly to hands and feet, to hold its prey, and tear at it with its fangs within the mouth. If met with mollusks, such as Shellder, it cracks the shell and sucks out the insides. Its appearance seems to be based on the ammonite, an extinct cephalapod that resembles a Chambered Nautilus.</description>

While concealed, Kabuto leaves exposed only its hard shell, which protects it from any attacks, while the glowing eyes on its back allow it to continue monitoring its surroundings. If it is flipped upside down, it becomes helpless and defenseless as it is unable to flip over on its own. According to the anime, oil extracted from a Kabuto is rumored to have interesting medical properties, longevity being one of them.</description>

<description>Kabutops is the evolved form of Kabuto. It lives in the water, and can move at high speeds by folding its limbs against its body. The creature comes out of the water to hunt. Kabutops is a predator, but its nature of feeding is vampiric; instead of killing its prey, it uses its razor sharp claws to open wounds in its prey, and then drink its blood. It attempts to avoid killing prey, so it may feed at a later date. Kabutops is loosely based on trilobites as a counterpoint to Omanyte and Omastar representing ammonites. This can clearly be seen with the enlarged cephalon and the pygidium and thoracic spines. It was introduced in Pokémon Red and Blue, where the player-character plays a part in reviving the assumed-extinct species by giving a Fossil to the Scientist on Cinnabar Island.</description>

It is imagined to have been the king of the skies in ancient times, with a body structure similar to a pterodactyl and other features, such as the head and tail, having more in common with dragons. It captures its prey with its talons and brings it to its nest. However, if the prey resists, it may use its razor-sharp teeth to immobilize it. When attacking its enemies or opponents, it goes for the throat with its saw like fangs. Aerodactyl is heavy and rough-skinned, leading to the development of strong wings.</description>

<description>Snorlax is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Munchlax when leveled up with high friendship. It also has a Gigantamax form.
In the Generation I and II games and their remakes, wild Snorlax can be found sleeping in inconvenient locations throughout Kanto. In order to catch one, a Trainer must first awaken it with music from either a Poké Flute or Pokégear set to the Poké Flute channel. A sleeping Snorlax makes a return in Pokémon X and Y, in which it is blocking the player`s way on Route 7.
Snorlax is a huge, bipedal, dark blue-green Pokémon with a cream-colored face, belly, and feet. Its body is composed of mostly its belly, as its limbs are comparatively small. Its head is large with small, pointed ears and two pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw. It has round feet, which both have three claws and a circular brown paw pad, and short arms with five claws on each hand. Snorlax`s bulk makes it the heaviest Normal type.
Snorlax is often found in mountains and forests. It wakes up only to eat, requiring 900 lbs. (400 kg) of food per day before returning to its slumber. It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it to eat even moldy food without feeling any ill effects. It can even handle thorny plants or Muk`s poison. It can also eat while it is resting. Snorlax is docile enough to let children and small Pokémon bounce on its large stomach.
Snorlax can show awesome power when prompted. As Gigantamax Snorlax, seeds and small rocks that were tangled in its belly fur goes through immense growth and a tree spouts upon its belly. The tree has three red clouds surrounding it like a circle. It almost never moves; even when in battle it only slightly lifts its body and attacks by flailing with its arms and legs. However, its attacks are very powerful — Gigantamax Snorlax is considered to be the strongest Dynamax Pokémon to have been discovered.
It is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Pulverizing Pancake and G-Max Move G-Max Replenish.</description>

<description>Articuno is one of the three Legendary Birds along with Zapdos and Moltres. It is a large bird with blue plumage, a bluish-white-feathered chest, a three feathered crest adorning its nose, and a long, sparkling tail. It can create and manipulate ice freely. Its translucent wings are imbued with the essence of frigidity, and the flapping of its wings chills the air, causing the conversion of water particles in the air into snow or ice, causing snow to fall when it flies overhead. In legend, Articuno resides within the confines of icy mountains, because those who have seen its were often doomed explorers scaling such mountains, and therefore it is believed Articuno makes it a point to appear before them and save them.
It is interesting to note that the last letters of its name, "uno" ("one" in Spanish), suggest it is the first of the three legendary bird Pokémon. This is reinforced by the fact that the last letters of the names of its fellow legendary birds suggest that they are the second and third. They are Zapdos ("dos", which is "two" in Spanish) and Moltres ("tres", which is "three" in Spanish).
Articuno`s video game appearances occur in the very confusing mazes of the icy Seafoam Islands, on Route 20, between Fuschia City and Cinnabar Island. It is a unique Pokémon that usually appears alongside Zapdos and Moltres. Since only one of each exists in the games, players usually try to catch the Birds.
Articuno also makes appearances in the anime and manga, also as a unique Pokémon and a general species. They participate in various events and battles. Articuno was initially believed to be the large golden bird Ash saw in the very first episode, but it turned out to actually be Ho-Oh, though the earlier reference was kept in the Red, Blue, Yellow game versions when one looked into a telescope and saw it. Its largest role is in Pokémon: The Movie 2000. Lawrence III creates a battle between the three birds, and Ash Ketchum had to team up with Lugia to stop them. In the beginning of the Battle Frontier challenge in the anime, Noland, the battle factory frontier brain had befriended one. After reuniting with their photographer friend Todd, Ash and its friends hear a rumor that Articuno lives on a certain mountain. After several encounters with Team Rocket, Ash and Todd are saved by Articuno from a snowstorm, and Todd manages to snap a picture of it. Ash`s Charizard did battle with it and Articuno lost by a narrow margin.
In Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, Articuno is the third legendary boss as well as the third legendary bird you battle. He is also the hardest to convince of the three legendary birds that the main hero Pokémon is not responsible for the havocs in the Pokémon World. Absol prevents Articuno from ending the hero and partner by ensuring that Articuno knows the truth.</description>

<description>Zapdos is one of the three Legendary Birds along with Articuno and Moltres. It may be based on the thunderbird. It is a bird with a yellow, angular body and wings. Also behind its main yellow wings is a second pair of thinner, jet-black wings. Its beak is long and extremely sharp. Zapdos, a creature that can freely manipulate electricity, is thought to live in thunderclouds, where it apparently only gains power when struck by lightning. It is seen emerging from clouds while dropping enormous lightning bolts, and even if it does not launch electricity its wings make peculiar crackling and snapping sounds as it flies.
It is interesting to note that the last letters of its name, "dos" ("two" in Spanish), suggest it is the second of the three legendary bird Pokémon. This is reinforced by the fact that the last letters of the names of its fellow legendary birds suggest that they are the first and third. They are Articuno ("uno", which is "one" in Spanish) and Moltres ("tres", which is "three" in Spanish).
Zapdos is found in a Power Plant off the coast of the Rock Tunnel near Cerulean City in Pokémon Red and Blue, and related games. It also plays small roles in the anime and manga. Zapdos is featured in Pokémon The Movie 2000 together with the other two Legendary birds, Articuno and Moltres. It appears that Zapdos communicates through electricity as it shocks Pikachu to communicate. Zapdos also appeared in the 9th Pokémon Movie.</description>

<description>Moltres is one of the three Legendary Birds, along with Articuno and Zapdos. It is a large bird that is literally ablaze with fire, resembling something related to a phoenix. It has an orange body, a small pointed beak, and where its plumage should be are flames of a searing intensity. It can freely create and manipulate fire, and it constantly looses flaming embers from its wings. When its body is injured for any reason, it will head towards a volcano and dip its body in the molten magma to heal its wounds. Moltres is an elusive creature, seen about as rarely as the other two members of the Legendary Bird triad. When Moltres thinks it is in the least bit possible danger, it will summon a flash of fire and seemingly disappear, flying out of sight very fast.
The first video game appearance of Moltres was in Pokémon Red and Blue versions. In these Versions, Moltres was in a blocked off area of Victory Road, only accessible from the end of the cave. However, Moltres was moved from its lair in FireRed and LeafGreen, to Mount Ember, an active volcano, on 1 Island, the first of the new Sevii Islands.
The first official appearance of Moltres in the anime was in the episode that marks the beginning of the Pokémon League, where it lights the torch which is equivalent to the real-life Olympic Torch. It also plays a role in "Pokémon The Movie 2000: The Power of One", along with the other two Legendary Birds (Zapdos and Articuno). It was one of the two birds that the villainous collector, often referred to as both Gelardan and Lawrence III, captured to allow him access to Lugia`s power, but the upset of the balance that occurred as a result nearly caused a worldwide weather catastrophe as Moltres was driven to wage war with its two rivals. They were quelled once Ash and Lugia fulfilled the prophecy related to the legendary birds. In a later episode of Pokémon Chronicles, Ash`s rival Richie encountered a trainer named Silver who wanted to capture Moltres, battling him with its Salamence. Silver is interrupted by Team Rocket members Butch and Cassidy who attempt to kidnap Moltres, rather than catching him fairly. Richie and Silver team up to defeat Butch and Cassidy and rescue Moltres, although the firebird was badly weakened by the Rockets` attack. Silver let Moltres go, wanting to catch him in a fair fight when it was at full strength, although it promised it`d try again.
According to one of the trainers in Blaine`s gym on Cinnabar Island, Blaine decided to become a trainer of Fire-type Pokémon after having been rescued by a fiery bird when lost in the mountains.</description>

<description>Dratini is a serpent-like dragon Pokémon with a white circle shape on its forehead. It has two developing wings at the sides of its head, which grow to be enormous as it evolves. Dratini are born small, and as they shed their skin, they grow larger. They have a massive amount of energy rapidly increasing inside of their bodies, hence, they have great strength which grows exponentially as they evolve. They were thought to be purely mythical creatures, but they were discovered to be real by a fisherman. They live in colonies in the ocean in limited numbers and fetch a high price as Pokémon to be used for battling. They can only be obtained by the most determined and skilled trainers, as demonstrated on various episodes of the original Pokémon series.
The episode in which Dratini first appeared ("The Legend of Dratini") has never been seen on American television, due to use of guns and humor considered "politically incorrect" to American audiences (Meowth dressed as Adolf Hitler, Jessie seducing a guard by dressing up as a schoolgirl).</description>

<description>Dragonair is the evolved form of Dratini. They look like desert serpents with a long, noticeable, light-blue and white body. They have a small horn on the forehead and two wing-shaped protuberances on the sides of the head which are often said to be ears, but are in fact wings, as evidenced in the short film preceding Pokémon: The Movie 2000. They have a blue orb placed at the neck and another two near the tip of the tail. Dragonair can discharge energy through the orbs to envelop itself in a gentle aura. This aura, which makes its body shine slightly and gives it a mystical appearance, is said to enable the Dragonair to control the weather in the immediate area and change it in a matter of minutes.
Dragonair live in large bodies of water such as the lakes or the sea. They store an enormous amount of energy inside their bodies, and seems to manifest itself in two distinct fashions. Even though they lack large wings, Dragonair have been seen flying with the wings on the side of the head greatly enlarged.</description>

<description>Dragonite is the final form of the Dratini evolutionary line. It evolves from Dragonair at level 55. Dragonite`s appearance is notably different from that of its previous forms. As Dragonite, it is now a golden bipedal dragon with a beige underbelly that extends from the top of its neck to the tip of its tail. Along with already being a Dragon-type, it has now gained the secondary Flying-type, growing wings. Dragonite is one of the fastest flying Pokémon, and "The fastest flying Pokémon" as of the first generation. It has a small horn on the top of its head, along with slightly "S" shaped antennae. However, much like its previous forms, Dragonite still has a gentle and somewhat innocent appearance. Its diet consists mainly of berries, soft plants, and fruit, while it will occasionally eat crustaceans, like Corphish and Krabby.
Dragonite are very loyal to any trainer they find worthy of acceptance. They are calm, gentle, and intelligent creatures, but when threatened can put their pudgy bulk to good use. Dragonite seem to have more advanced vocal abilities compared to other Pokémon in that they make several different types of calls, rather than just saying their name. They have been noted to save drowning swimmers and threatened sailors. Dragonites` speed is very varied; some Dragonite can have great speeds while other have very low/average speeds. It is said that Dragonite can circle the globe in less than 16 hours.
Dragonite`s main anime appearance was at the end of the Orange Island League season in "Enter The Dragonite". It was spotted twice in the previous episode "Hello Pummelo" as Ash, Tracy and Misty saw it flying over the sea around Pummelo Island and they learned that it was owned by the "Orange Crew" leader, Drake. It also defeated Team Rocket as they tried to steal Dragonite. In Ash`s six on six battle with Drake, it defeated Ash`s Charizard with Dragon Rage, Squirtle with Thunder and Tauros with Thunder before Ash`s Pikachu took it out with a Thunder of its own. While none of Ash`s Pokémon were strong enough to defeat Dragonite on their own, their combined attacks steadily weakened it to the point of exhaustion, allowing Pikachu to finally defeat it. Drake keeps Dragonite`s Poké Ball on a necklace. Professor Oak also owns a Dragonite and was used prior to the episode "The Mastermind of Mirage Pokémon". It also appeared in Pokémon: The First Movie, when it was sent by Mewtwo to give Ash and his friends an invitation. It also appeared in the beginning of Ash`s journey when he encountered Bill. Here, Dragonite was described as an unknown legendary Pokémon by the Pokédex, and because it was nighttime the colour of its skin couldn`t be seen.</description>

It was created by scientists through genetic manipulation of Mew`s DNA involving repeated recombination, gene splicing, and other DNA experiments over many years. While its DNA is mostly similar to the original Mew DNA, Mewtwo is very different in both its body size and personality. Its creators did not imbue him with compassion, making it one of the most savage Pokémon, able to strike fear into its enemies with its cold, glowing eyes. Being made for battle, its combat abilities and psychic powers were developed to be of the highest level, and it always thinks of defeating its opponents. In order to always fight at full power, it remains motionless to conserve energy.
In the events of the Pokémon: The First Movie, Mewtwo awakens, destroys the laboratory where it is created and being kept, and works under Giovanni, who had originally ordered Mewtwo`s creation, until realizing it is just being used. After escaping, it tries to destroy the humans that `enslave` Pokémon and start a new world. During Pokémon: Mewtwo Returns, it seeks complete solitude and chooses to live without fighting. Giovanni tries to recapture Mewtwo, but it is ultimately saved by Ash. Mewtwo chooses not to confine himself to the world and roams the earth. In the "Mastermind of the Mirage Pokémon" a mirage copy of Mewtwo is seen furiously battling Ash and its friends.</description>

<description>Mew is a Psychic-type legendary Pokémon. It was first introduced as a secret Pokémon in the first generation. Nintendo`s specialists in Pokémon have spoken, in Nintendo`s Pokémon-related speech in 2007, that Mewtwo is more powerful than Mew, therefore being a clone (better from the original: Pokémon Red and Blue and Yellow). Mew appears as a pink feline-esque Pokémon with large feet, big blue eyes, and a very long tail. Its skin is covered with a layer of fine pink hair. By nature, Mew is known to be a playful and kind Pokémon. Its DNA is said to possess the genetic composition of all existing Pokémon species, thus allowing it to use all known Pokémon techniques. In the anime, it is also capable of further teleportation, summoning giant pink bubbles of psychic energy (which serve various purposes such as closing itself in for protection, act as a cushion, or simply for Mew`s amusement of bouncing on), and rendering itself invisible.
In the first generation video games, Mew is mentioned in journal entries found in the Pokémon Mansion on Cinnabar Island stating that it was discovered deep in the jungles of Guyana, South America on July 5 (the year was not specified) and named on July 10, and that it "gave birth" to Mewtwo on Feb. 6. Mew was available at Kiosks during special events held by Nintendo after the release of Red, Blue, and Yellow. However, a glitch exists in these Generation I games that allows the player to capture a level 7 Mew.
Mew plays a role in some of the Pokémon anime films. In Pokémon: The First Movie, Mewtwo was created from a fossilized Mew hair found in the Amazon. A single Mew travels to where Mewtwo is holding its tournament in order to convince it to stop. It also made a short appearance in Mewtwo Returns (a special episode involving the whole of Team Rocket (including Giovanni) and Mewtwo, as well as various other characters.) In Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew, the backdrop revolves around Mew`s mysterious history and how this extremely rare Pokémon came to be so powerful. Also, at the beginning of the movie, a Pokémon "family tree" is shown. The first Pokémon on it is Mew, and the last is Ho-oh. Since Mew contains the genetic composition that is found in every species of Pokémon, Mew has the ability to transform into any Pokémon like Ditto. However, in the anime, Mew does not need to see the Pokémon in order to transform into it.</description>

<description>Chikorita is the Grass-type Starter Pokémon in Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal. One may also get this Pokémon in Pokémon Emerald by completing the Hoenn Dex (not including Jirachi and Deoxys). It is reptilian in appearance, but it has a large leaf sprouting from its head, a collar of crystalline seeds around its neck, and a short tail. Chikorita, by nature, are docile Pokémon that love to soak up the sun`s rays. The leaf serves multiple purposes; in its natural environment, its leaf detects the density of humidity and temperature in the atmosphere to help it seek warm places. The pleasant aroma that wafts from the leaf can be used by Chikorita in battle by waving it around to becalm the foe and keep it at bay. In the Pokémon anime, Ash Ketchum caught a Chikorita early on its adventure through Johto, after saving it from a sudden snowstorm. Chikorita is very affectionate, stubborn, and powerful, often sees Pikachu as a rival for Ash`s affections, and apparently has a crush on Ash. In the episode "Current Events", Chikorita evolves into a Bayleef when Ash was almost in mortal peril.</description>

<description>Bayleef is the evolution of Chikorita and first appeared in Pokémon Gold and Silver. It has a pale yellow body supported by four legs and a rather long neck and tail. On top of its head is a single large leaf. Its most defining trait is the "necklace" of seven tubular leaves that is located around its neck. Each of these curled up leaves contains inside it a tree shoot. From these leaves wafts a spicy scent that has stimulating properties. It can cheer people up, restore their health, make them more energetic and even heighten their drive for competition.
Bayleef is one of the Pokémon that Ash has used in its team. It evolved from Chikorita in the episode "Current Events". Like its pre-evolved form, Bayleef feels a strong bond of affection towards its trainer, which it usually expresses that feeling by trying to climb all over him, a matter complicated by the dramatic increase in mass. Ash used Bayleef in many battles in Johto, including gym battles and Johto League, where it battled against various opponents. Bayleef is currently at Professor Oak`s lab since Ash decided to make a fresh start when going to Hoenn, and therefore left all of his Pokémon except Pikachu with Professor Oak.</description>

<description>Meganium is the final form of the Chikorita evolutionary line. It is a human-sized, green creature resembling an apatosaurus, but with stamen-like antennae extending from its forehead and a large flower growing around its collar. Meganium`s antennae are smaller in females than in males.
The pheremones within its flower are its defense against those who would attack it for its size; they give off a fragrance that can instill feelings of peace and calm in all around it, thus suppressing their need to attack Meganium for food. This fragrance is effective enough to affect even a Pokémon like Primeape, which is noted for its unmatched temper. Meganium also has magically natural powers in its breath, which somehow is able to restore life to dead plants and grass.</description>

<description>Cyndaquil is the Fire-type Starter Pokémon in Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal. In Pokémon Emerald you may get Cyndaquil after completing the Hoenn Dex. Cyndaquil are covered with a flame-resistant, dull-yellow fur with a rich streak of blue running from the tip of its snout over its head and spreading out to cover the majority of its back. There are also four spots of red fur on the back. When Cyndaquil is frightened or angry, it can focus its internal energy to produce blazing "spines" of flame from the spots. While it is a quadruped, Cyndaquil is more than capable of maneuvering on two legs. They are based on an echidna.
Cyndaquil are generally timid and not naturally aggressive, and are often seen curled into a ball for protection. This action leaves its back and special flame-emitting vent fur exposed. When predators and enemies stalk too close, Cyndaquil unleashes a furious flame from the vents as a deterrent. If provoked further, Cyndaquil will intensify its flames, creating a smokescreen that will buy it some time to escape.
Cyndaquil has made numerous appearances in the Pokémon anime, mostly under the control of Ash. His Cyndaquil often seemed to be very shy and relaxed, often sleeping. At first, it needed time to warm up and use flamethrower, but with some training from Ash, it is now able to use its flamethrower whenever it wants. It also possesses prodigious dodging capabilities, able to wear opponents down by simply evading long series of attacks over an extended period of time. Cyndaquil is currently at Professor Oak`s lab since Ash decided to make a fresh start when going to Hoenn, and therefore, left all of its Pokémon, except Pikachu, with Professor Oak.</description>

<description>Quilava is the evolution of Cyndaquil. Quilava have long, thin bodies with small forepaws and slightly longer hindpaws, similar to real-life weasels. Their tan fur is slightly darker than Cyndaquil`s, while the blue streak has been lowered to cover their eyes. As per the family line, Quilava sport short, coarse fireproof fur and have special vents on their heads and lower backs. Though they do not have a tail, the lower vents are positioned as to give the illusion of one.
Quilava are noted in the Pokédex to turn their backs toward their opponents in battle as a sign that they are about to use their flame-based abilities in battle, or to intimidate foes by demonstrating their power. Quilava are noted for their speed, and can nimbly evade attacks while scorching their enemies. They can also create gusts of superheated air, albeit to the same effect.</description>

<description>Typhlosion is the final form of the Cyndaquil evolutionary line. Unlike Cyndaquil, Typhlosion bears no relation to the echidna, instead resembling something of a wolverine or badger. The number of special vents it possesses has dropped to the row on its upper back; however, it can put forth a tremendous amount of heat. Typhlosion carries the same coloration of its lower forms. Its yellow fur is brighter than it is on Quilava, yet still duller than Cyndaquil. Its fur is incredibly coarse, dry, and somewhat shaggy, but still fire-proof. This fur, when rubbed together by Typhlosion, can be used to create huge explosions.
Far more aggressive than either Cyndaquil or Quilava, Typhlosion are exceedingly hard to find out in the plains. They are a common cause of grass fires as the heat they expel is hot enough to cause the air around them to shimmer. It viciously assaults its opponents, reducing them to ashes with its incredibly hot flames. Though not color-blind, Typhlosion have slightly poorer eyesight than Quilava due to smaller pupils. They make up for it with a keen sense of smell and remarkable hearing.
A Typhlosion owned by Jimmy is featured in Pokémon: Legend of Thunder; it tries to help save the Legendary Pokémon Raikou from being cruelly exploited by Team Rocket associates.</description>

<description>Totodile is the Water-type Starter Pokémon in Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal. It resembles a small crocodile and has a short blue body with a yellow band on its chest. On its back and tail are four red spikes. Totodile has a big and prominent jaw, filled with many sharp teeth; it is strong enough to cut down a tree. It`s very energetic, cheerful and rowdy, and occasionally can be seen running through swampy areas, biting and chomping at everything that moves.
In the anime, Ash acquires a Totodile after a duel with Misty to determine its rightful owner. Ash`s Totodile is rather carefree, fun loving, and loves to dance. It is shown to be friendly towards other Pokémon, and is a fast swimmer, as shown in Pokémon Heroes. Ash used Totodile in many battles throughout Johto, including the Johto League. A Totodile seen in the very first episode of the Johto series was very attached to Jessie from Team Rocket, or rather, her long hair (which Totodile loved to bite) that runs down her back. Ash`s Totodile is currently at Professor Oak`s lab since Ash decided to make a fresh start when going to Hoenn, and therefore, left all of his Pokémon except Pikachu with Professor Oak.</description>

<description>Croconaw is the evolution of Totodile. It opens its huge jaws wide when attacking. If it loses any fangs while biting, new ones will quickly grow back in its place so that it always has 48 fangs. The tips of these fangs are slanted backward. Once Croconaw has clamped its jaws on its foe, it will absolutely not let go. Because the tips of its fangs are forked back like barbed fishhooks, they become impossible to remove when they have sunk in. This means that the prey has no hope of escape. The pattern on Croconaw`s belly vaguely resembles a jungle tunic or loincloth. Croconaw live in or around swamps. When they evolve into Feraligatr, they move into an area where there is a waterfall.</description>

<description>Feraligatr is the final form of the Totodile evolutionary line. Feraligatrs are massive, Godzilla-like crocodiles with long, blue bodies and four legs, although they may also stand upright on land. Their appendages have sharp claws at the ends, and its jaw is lined with teeth. On its head, back, and tail there are red, jagged scales. As stated in the Pokédex in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, "Feraligatr intimidates its foes by opening its huge mouth. In battle, it will kick the ground hard with its thick and powerful hind legs to charge at the foe with incredible speed."
Feraligatrs are ferocious and have a tendency to lash out at those that come too close. They eat Magikarp and other fish-like Pokémon, as well as larger prey (such as Stantler and Tauros) when they come close enough to the water.</description>

<description>Sentret is a very cautious Pokémon, it raises itself up onto its tail to get a better view of its surroundings. While standing on its tail, it can see a long way. If it spots an enemy, it will cry out loudly to warn its kind. It will also hit the ground with its tail. A Sentret will only sleep when another one is standing guard. The Sentret will wake the others at the first sign of danger. Because of this, if one is separated from its pack, then it will be unable to sleep due to fear.

<description>Furret live in colonies with tunnels much too small for normal Pokemon to traverse, yet it is a perfect fit for the slim build of Furret as it hides from the outside world at the surface by traversing through these tunnels like gophers. These tunnel colonies become very complex, especially if they are very deep, and can potentially stretch for miles. Occasionally, these colonies are found intertwined with Diglett colonies. The Furret evolves from Sentret at level 15.
Furret`s rudimentary paws and legs are deceptively nimble, making Furret a quick, unpredictable predator especially skillful at hunting Rattata, its main prey. Also, the fur of the Pokemon is thicker than it appears, and Furret can fluff up its fur to make itself look much stronger and larger than it actually is as an intimidation tactic towards potential foes.

However, it actually has two feet; at least one is retracted against its body at almost all times, and Hoothoot can switch between one foot and the other at speeds almost too fast for the human eye. Hoothoot are also known for having precise senses of time, due to a special mechanism in their brain that measures the rotation of the earth. Properly trained, they can be more accurate than all but the most precise of clocks. In nature, they always begin hooting at the same time every night.</description>

<description>Noctowl is the second owl Pokémon, being the evolution of Hoothoot. It is a large bird whose plumage is colored in various shades of brown. Its round head has two piercing, red eyes and two large "eyebrows". These eyebrows help balance Noctowl while it is flying to increase its aerodynamics. When hunting, Noctowl puts its prodigious eyesight to good use to hunt down prey without fail. It is also very good at sneaking up to its victims unnoticed thanks to its supple, soft-feathered wings that allow it to fly without making any noise. When a Noctowl needs to ponder especially deep thoughts, it can rotate its head 180 degrees, which serves to increase its intellectual faculties.
In the anime, a shiny Noctowl has been part of Ash`s team during his travels in Johto. Ash frequently used his Noctowl to explore an area from the sky, or to puncture Team Rocket`s hot-air balloon. Ash used it in many battles throughout Johto, but it is currently living in Professor Oak`s lab since Ash decided to make a fresh start and leave all of his Pokémon except for Pikachu when he left for Hoenn.</description>

When Ledyba become part of a swarm, they become much more active and can cluster next to each other for warmth in cold weather. A Ledyba communicates with others through an aromatic fluid excreted from the points where its legs meet its thorax. By subtly changing the fluid`s scent, the Ledyba can convey a number of different feelings. The fluid can also help to determine a Ledyba`s location as well as its current feelings.

These spots have also been observed glowing red during twilight hours as Ledian are attached to trees, making these trees seem like Christmas trees. Male Ledian are shown having longer antennae than females.
Ledian is a nocturnal insect, active mainly during the night and sleeping in curled-up leaves during the day. Countless Ledian live in outdoor areas located a good distance away from the polluted atmospheres of cities, for the star-lit skies are always clearer in these clean lands than in the light pollution of urban areas. Ledian have an affinity to stars for good reason; They take their energy from the light of the stars in order to live healthily. When many stars are visible, the Ledian will sprinkle a mysterious, glowing powder whilst fluttering about.</description>

<description>Spinarak is a six legged spider-like Pokémon with a marking on its back that is similar to a face. It spins a web of fine silk and then waits patiently and with complete motionlessness until prey, such as a bug Pokémon, becomes ensnared in the sticky web. It then waits until nightfall, at which point Spinarak prepares and then devours the prey. The web can be called Spinarak`s "second nervous system" because the Pokémon is able to determine the type of prey that has become trapped simply through the vibrations that are created.
In the anime, there is a small town whose police force uses Spinarak to fight crime, honoring a Spinarak that had caught a criminal called the black arachnid in the past. This was shown in the episode Spinarak attack.</description>

It captures prey by spinning its strong silk around the prey, rendering it helpless to be devoured or carried back to the nest. Ariados` feet end in hooks that allow it to grip well enough to walk on vertical surfaces and on horizontal surfaces upside-down. Ariados uses its nest as a base of sorts. A strand of silk is constantly spun from its rear that leads back to its nest. This allows it to wander in search of food, which it usually does at night. This is in contrast to its unevolved form, Spinarak, which instead waits patiently for its prey to come to its web.</description>

<description>Crobat is the evolution of Golbat as of the Gold and Silver editions of the game. It`s a purple bat with four wings, with two main wings above and two secondary wings below. The development of these lower wings to replace its legs, as a result of its pursuit of faster, yet more silent flight, enables it to fly fast and silently indeed, but also makes it tough to stop and rest. Its extra wings will even allow it to fly long distances by alternating which set of wings it uses when it tires. The only way it can rest is to hang on a tree branch using its lower legs to grab onto it the way normal bats would. It flies so silently through the dark on its four wings that it may not be noticed even when nearby. It uses this to its advantage when hunting prey.
The appearances of Crobat in the anime have been largely of Brock`s Crobat. Brock caught a Zubat very early on in the original series, and it evolved into a Golbat, and then a Crobat.</description>

A Chinchou`s eyes are yellow and their pupils have the shape of plus signs. When blinking or closing its eyes, only the vertical parts close, making the pupils look like minus signs. Its habitat is the dark depths of the ocean floor. In the absence of any other light, Chinchou sees its surroundings and communicates by shooting positive and negative charged electricity particles between the tips of its antennae, creating an electric current and thus light. This can be said to be a form of bioluminescence. The charges Chinchou shoots between its antennae can also be used offensively, to stun its opponents with a flash of light or shock them with electricity.</description>

<description>Lanturn uses the bright part of its body, which gradually evolved from a dorsal fin, to lure prey.

It uses this light to attract and blind prey, and then swallow the immobilized prey in a single gulp. The light is also useful for Lanturn to navigate through the deep, murky waters. The light from its antenna is produced by bacterial symbiosis. Bioluminescent bacteria in Lanturn`s antenna cause a chemical reaction with Lanturn`s bodily fluids to create the bright light.</description>

<description>Pichu, known as the "Tiny Mouse" species of Pokémon, are the pre-evolved version of Pikachu. They stand at 1`00" and weight 4.4 lbs. Their cheeks are pink, and they have small, plump bodies with short, jagged tails, and large ears. They are not skilled at storing electricity, so when amused or startled, they often discharge jolts of electricity strong enough to affect adult humans. This lack of control becomes more stable as they grow older. The electricity that they do manage to keep stored is limited by their small electrical pouches in their cheeks. When the air is dry or on stormy days, they charge much more easily, leaving the sound of crackling static electricity emanating from them. They play with each other by touching tails to set off sparks, which also acts as a test of courage. They run the risk of shorting each other out, and scaring themselves into a crying fit with the flash of sparks that emanates from them. In the anime, it is said that a Pichu cannot use electric attacks without hurting itself. This is a feature not prominently featured in the games.
Pichu first appeared in Pokémon Gold and Silver, and is one of many pre-evolutions introduced into the series. At one point, a Nintendo GameCube game called Pichu Bros: Party Panic was in development but never released, featuring Pichu as the main character. Instead, the game was integrated into Pokémon Channel as an important part of the story-line.</description>

Between these ears is a large swirl of pink fur. It has two small eyes, no visible nose, and a small mouth. It also has a patch of darker pink fur under each eye. Cleffa first appears in Pokémon Gold and Silver, as one of the several pre-evolutions introduced into the series.
Cleffa love to stick their tongues out and are often seen hanging around other baby Pokémon such as Igglybuff. For unknown reasons, possibly due to its unusual star-shaped silhouette, when lots of meteors illuminate the night sky, sightings of Cleffa strangely increase. Some people believe that they came to the Pokémon universe on a meteor. If the impact site of any meteorite is found, this Pokémon is certain to be within the immediate area. On nights with many shooting stars, Cleffa can be seen dancing in a ringlike formation. They dance through the night and stop only at the break of day, when these Pokémon quench their thirst with the morning dew. Like Staryu, it is a Starshape Pokémon- consequently, scientists in the Pokémon universe are trying to find a connection between the two. In the same way its evolved form Clefairy loves the moon, Cleffa are fond of shooting stars.</description>

Like its evolutions Jigglypuff and Wigglytuff, Igglybuff`s body shares many properties with a balloon. It is very soft, elastic and flexible and somewhat feels and smells like a marshmallow. This enables it to bounce a long way, to the extent that Igglybuff finds it more efficient to move around by bouncing instead of walking on its two short legs.
Although Igglybuff too has the notorious singing ability of its evolutionary chain, its vocal cords are not yet fully developed in this early stage of its life. A prolonged singing effort results in Igglybuff turning a deeper and deeper pink as it strains itself, finally ending up damaging its throat. Igglybuff tends to gargle with clear saltwater to soothe itself. Igglybuff is first introduced in Pokémon Gold and Silver as one of several of the pre-evolved Pokémon introduced in the game.</description>

<name>Togepii</name>
<gender>dimorphic</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Togepi is a baby Pokémon that hatches from an egg. The Pokédex says that this Pokémon`s "shell is filled with joy" and that it will bring happiness to its trainer as it travels along with him/her. In the Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal games, Togepi first appears as a mystery egg given to the player by a minor character called "Mr. Pokémon", which he/she has to take back to Professor Elm. In FireRed and LeafGreen a character living in the Sevii Islands will give you a Togepi egg, but this event happens only after obtaining the National Pokédex. Like all infant Pokémon, on the day a Togepi hatches, it develops a parental relationship with the first person it sees. (for example, the Togepi would think of the first female it sees as its mother)
In the Pokémon anime, Togepi is the second second-generation Pokémon to be introduced as a character before the release of Pokémon Gold and Silver (Ho-oh was the first). Ash Ketchum discovers an egg in the ancient ruins at Grandfather Canyon. He carries this egg around until the episode "Who Gets to Keep Togepi?". The egg hatches, and after a long dispute it is decided that Misty will keep the newly-hatched Pokémon. Since then, she grows inseparable to it and carries it around everywhere, going frantic whenever it gets lost. She usually keeps it in her backpack when she thinks that it needs protection. The only attacks that it is shown to use are Charm, and more notably, Metronome (which it learned by trying it after witnessing another Pokémon using it), which usually saves Ash and his friends from mortal peril; in one instance, it teleported them out of danger, another, it created a huge explosion, and in another used Reflect.
In a later episode in season six within the Advanced Generation, Misty travels to Hoenn to meet up with Ash, Brock, May, and Max. Due to one of Team Rocket`s plans going wrong, they end up in "Mirage Kingdom", a place where people praise Togepi for they believe it will be their savior. Togepi ends up going into a mirage, followed by Ash and his crew, to discover a Togepi Paradise in ruins. To defend it, it evolves into a Togetic, a Pokémon that makes its first Anime appearance and defeats the villain of "Mirage Kingdom". It then makes the difficult decision of staying in the Togepi Paradise to protect it instead of continuing with Misty. In the end, Misty released Togetic so it can defend Mirage Kingdom and returned to her duties as the Cerulean City gym leader.
The English DVD release of Mewtwo Strikes Back incorrectly refers to Togepi as Pokémon #152.</description>

<description>Togetic is a highly auspicious species. It is associated with good fortune and happiness, but it is said that it will grant its boons and affection only to kind-hearted, caring people. In fact, it will even grow sad itself if it is in mean-spirited company for a prolonged period of time. Togetic`s rudimentary wings do not permit it to actually fly, but it has in lost time learned to remain floating in midair without even using them. In the new Diamond and Pearl games, Togetic is granted an evolution, Togekiss, using the Shiny Stone.
In the anime, Misty`s Togepi evolves into Togetic in order to protect the Togepi indigenous to the mystical Mirage Kingdom from a villain. After peace is restored, it decides to remain there in order to watch over its fellow Pokémon and Misty releases it, parting with a Pokémon she has had for most of the series` original generation.
Togetic later appeared in the 11th movie, Near the waters with its partner, Riolu.</description>

<description>Natu are very small, spherical, green birds with underdeveloped, textured wings, red talons, red tail feathers, and a red plume on each of their foreheads. Since their wings are not fully grown, Natu are unable to fly and therefore must hop around in order to get around. As a result of this, however, Natu`s jumping abilities are quite developed and they can hop great distances. They are diurnal herbivores that live in savanna areas. They forage for food on the ground by custom, but when a lack of food on the ground is apparent, Natu turn to the trees that grow in the savannas. With their strong jumping ability in their talons, Natu may either charge forward and quite literally run up the trunk of a small tree to reach a branch or use both their legs and their flapping wings to propel themselves onto higher tree branches well over seven feet off the ground. Once there, they peck at and feed on the tree`s recently grown shoots.
Natu have a peculiar nature in observing. Whenever they are seen, they always appear to be looking at something intently in particular. When a human makes eye contact with a Natu, the Pokemon will unfailingly stare back intently at him or her without hopping to safety, even though humans in comparison should be intimidatingly large. However, if that human moves even slightly, the Natu will suddenly hop away to safety.</description>

<description>Xatu has a colorful and elaborate plumage with two red eyes imprinted on its breast; making the Pokémon look like an Native American totem pole. In Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl, male Xatu have three yellow stripes along its lower area, while female Xatu only have two. It possesses the power of precognition, rendering it able to see into the past and the future. It often remains motionless for an entire day staring at the sun while it views the past and present. It will also meditate from morning to sunset without moving. Xatu is said to be overwhelmed by the visual feedback of seeing two different time periods at once, or in terror at seeing the perils the future holds. In the game it is said that in some South American countries, Xatu is highly revered as a mystical Pokémon for its abilities.</description>

<description>Mareep are blue skinned sheep or lamb-like creatures which have long, striped tails with a yellow ball at the tip. Their fleece is yellow, while their bodies are a dark blue color. Their ears are a rounded cone shape and channel the electricity that they keep in their fleece. Mareep are said to build up a stockpile of static electricity by rubbing the fluffy woolen fleece on their body, with that of other Mareep. The electricity is then stored in their fleece, and will shock predators on contact. The more electricity that is stored, the brighter the ball on the tip of a Mareep`s tail is thought to glow. In summer, the fleece is fully shed, but would grow back within a week. Mareep also are thought to store air in the fleece, enabling it to control its body temperature whatever the weather.</description>

It has black stripes on its ears and its long tail, and it has small, beady eyes that look like black dots. It has a blue ball on the tip of its tail. Flaaffy usually likes to sit upright, although it can stand on two legs if necessary. Its wool quality changes as it matures so that it can generate a high amount of strong static electricity while still having a small amount of wool. Its bare, electric-resistant, parts of its hides enable it to prevent electrocution. As a result of storing too much, it develops patches even where wool won`t grow.</description>

Ampharos has powerful light abilities, its main light sources being the large orbs on its tail and head, and because of this is often used as a beacon in lighthouses, and mythical legend says that these lights can even be seen from outer space. Before the introduction of modern technology, Ampharos` light was used to communicate between long distances, in much a similar way to smoke signals.</description>

<description>Bellossom is a diurnal plant Pokémon. It evolves from Gloom if exposed to a Sun Stone. Bellossom`s petals can rotate, and they usually do when it is absorbing sunlight. The color of their leaves vary from a sickly brown and gray to a fluorescent yellow and red, depending on how much sunlight it has absorbed in the past few hours. When its petals are moving, either due to rotating or dancing, they rub together to make relaxing, bell-like sounds. The petals on its head also create a sweet scent.
It is also noted that a Bellossom will be even more beautiful if it was an especially rancid Gloom. The worse it smells as a Gloom, the prettier its petals will be as a Bellossom. Although naturally a peaceful and friendly Pokémon, it can be very territorial and violent fights can break out if there is an intruder or a challenger. Despite this, it is very social in areas outside of its self-determined territory, and the most common time to find a group of Bellossom together is when they all meet in one location to dance. It is said that these dances summon the sun.
Its Japanese name, "Kireihana", translates to "Beautiful" (kirei) and "Flower" (hana).</description>

<description>Marill is an aquatic mouse Pokémon. Marill`s tail floats like a buoy because it is filled with oil, which is less dense than water. When fishing at a fast-running stream, Marill wraps its tail around a tree. Since the tail is stretchy and flexible, it allows the Pokémon to get food and still stay safely anchored. Otherwise, when in a lake, it uses the buoy-qualities of its tail to keep itself suspended as the rest of its body dives underwater to feed on aquatic plants. Its fur is impermeable, which keeps it dry, and that allows it to swim through water at high speed without being slowed by the water`s resistance.
In the Pokémon Anime, Tracey, the Pokémon Observer from the Orange Islands, has a Marill which he uses on multiple occasions.</description>

<description>Azumarill is the evolved form of Marill. Azumarill resembles a blue, bipedal rabbit with a large, ellipsoid body, long blue ears with red insides, and a blue ball on the end of its thin, elastic black tail. The white bubble-like pattern on its lower stomach helps it to camouflage itself from potential predators when it is in the water.
Azumarill`s long ears act as sensors to identify sounds even in fast running rivers. Otherwise, when alone, Azumarill plays in water as a natural pastime, though it must roll up its elongated ears to prevent the sensitive sensory materials inside them from getting wet. The ball at the end of its tail can act as a sensor and guide it while under water. It can make thick, liquid balloons out of thin air with the saliva-water stored in its body. If it spots a drowning Pokémon in any body of water, it fashions such air balloons and jumps in to give the troubled Pokémon air balloons to help it breathe.
In the Pokémon anime, Paul owned an Azumarill which he used in a gym battle against Roark. Although it knew powerful Water attacks like Hydro Pump, it lost to Roark`s Geodude, which prompted Paul to give it to a Pokémon trainer passing by, being disappointed by its strength.</description>

<description>Sudowoodo is a bending, bipedal creature vaguely in the shape of a tree trunk. It has a double-pronged protuberance on its head, tiny feet, a simple face, and a pair of three-fingered hands where the fingers are green spheres resembling leaves on a tree. Although Sudowoodo pretends to be a tree, its body is made not out of wood, but rock. It uses this as a form of camouflage, hiding among forest areas to avoid being attacked by enemies. Additionally, its signature technique is Mimic, which allows it to copy enemy attacks. It earns its classification as the imitation Pokémon through these practices.
In the winter seasons, when trees are either white with snow or have had their leaves fall off from autumn, Sudowoodo is easy to spot as a fake because its hands remain green, making winter a more dangerous time for Sudowoodo to be in the presence of foes. Also, as a creature whose composition resembles rock, Sudowoodo hates water, so it will disappear and seek shelter when rainfall begins. In the video games, it often blocks areas until sprayed with water, which causes it to battle. In Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, the twig-shaped appendage atop a Sudowoodo`s head is larger on a male than it is on a female. The origin of its name is: Pseudo (False) + Wood.</description>

<description>Politoed, a frog Pokémon, is an alternate evolution of Poliwhirl that is obtained by trading it to another player with a King`s Rock. Politoed has green skin which turns yellow at its paws, lower jaw and belly. Its belly is adorned with a green spiral mark, similar to its pre-evolutionary forms. On top of its head grows a long blue hair that is curled in a manner similar to the spiral. Politoed dominates over its related species. When Poliwags and Poliwhirls hear its cry, they come running to its side from far and wide. Its status is displayed in the form of its single blue curly hair, which is an object of reverence among its "subjects." The longer and more curled the hair, the better respected the Politoed who supports it.
In the anime, Politoed is one of the Pokémon used by Misty. She obtained it when her Poliwhirl was withdrawn in its Poké Ball while holding the King`s Rock Ash had previously won as a Pokémon sumo tournament prize. Misty`s Politoed is strong and cheerful. It is frequently seen joyfully dancing around.</description>

<description>Hoppip are small, spherical creatures, with long leaves protruding from their head. They have small, gripping feet and ears disproportionate to their body, used to listen for winds. Hoppip have extremely petite and almost weightless bodies, and are susceptible to strong winds due to this. When a Hoppip feels a gale approaching, it will lock the leaves on its head with the leaves of other Hoppip, in an attempt to avoid being blown away. If a Hoppip is by itself when in heavy winds, it may grip the ground with its feet to prevent this. Despite the dangers Hoppip face in strong winds, they enjoy gentle breezes and can float in the calmest of winds, which can carry them across vast distances.</description>

This allows Skiploom to be used as a thermometer. It is capable of floating in the air, a skill it uses to get closer to the sun in order to better absorb the sunlight. When the sunlight is strong, its ability, Chlorophyll, increases its speed. When it rains, the flower instantly closes and Skiploom hides under a tree to avoid getting wet.</description>

They are very adept at catching the warm southern winds and navigating their way to any location in the world, typically overseas and until they encounter a cold air current, whereupon they will begin landing. While floating, Jumpluff release spores that propagate its offspring around the world. This method of reproduction is reminiscent of dandelions.</description>

<description>Aipom resembles a purple squirrel monkey with its face forever frozen in a maniacal grin that can be described as rictus and a blank stare from its round eyes. On its thin tail is a three fingered hand-like appendage that is very dexterous. It provides both propulsion and balance while Aipom leaps from tree to tree. Aipom is not aggressive by nature and will attempt to tire its natural opponents through dexterous dodging of the opponent`s attacks in hope that the enemy will be discouraged and leave. Otherwise, if the enemy is persistent, the Aipom will try to retreat, but if it is unable to, it will attack by diving at its opponent from the trees.
In the anime, an Aipom steals Ash`s hat, and follows his group around until Ash battles and captures it. Ash`s Aipom is quite attached to him, getting incredibly jealous when it sees Pikachu on Ash`s shoulder. Aipom has the distinction of being the only Pokemon aside from Pikachu that Ash brought with him to Sinnoh, although inadvertently. Aipom seems to enjoy contests, and Dawn believes it prefers contests over battles. In "Throwing the Track Switch!", Ash trades Aipom for Dawn`s Buizel because both Pokemon seemed more interested in the other trainer`s training. In "Journey to the Unknown", Dawn`s Aipom evolves into Ambipom.</description>

According to the Pokédex, Sunkern`s diet is said only to be morning dew, which collects under the leaves of plants beneath it.

However, it is very active and playful during the day when the sun is bright. Like Bellossom, it evolves using a Sun Stone. Sunflora prefer hot climates; their foliage becomes more colorful and elaborate as the temperature rises. Sunflora unfurl their petals and absorb sunlight for energy. It is possible for a Sunflora to absorb too much sunlight, though. When this happens, its head and petals become engorged and very heavy, which is dangerous for a Sunflora, since it can wilt and possibly get sick. At night, the petals are furled, covering Sunflora`s face.
A Sunflora is constantly soaking up sunlight and moving around in a blissful fashion. In preparation for winter, Sunflora will migrate to warmer and sunnier areas, so as not to lose the vital source of their energy. Sunflora like to live in flower patches. They do their best to stay hidden among the other flowers, but usually they are very noticeable.</description>

Quagsire always bear an absent-looking facial expression. This is likely due to Quagsire`s easy-going nature. It hunts by staying still in the water with its mouth open, waiting for small prey to swim into its mouth. It doesn`t move, and therefore, doesn`t get hungry. It`s not uncommon that a fishermen`s hook will get caught in the gaping mouth of a feeding Quagsire. Trying to eat what it has caught, the Quagsire would try to swallow, and end up pulling the fishermen off his boat and into the water. Male Quagsire have larger fins on their backs. They wait at the bottom of lakes waiting for prey to wander into its mouth. It also loves eating cherries.</description>

The appearance of Espeon is said to resemble the Japanese mythological creature known as Nekomata which also displays the feline body with forked tail tip and solid colored eyes. An Espeon`s fur is used to sense air currents, allowing it to predict the weather, as well as the actions of its opponent in battle. Its forked tail quivers when this occurs. A red jewel rests on its head, and glows whenever Espeon uses its psychic abilities. Espeon are described as being very loyal to their trainers once they consider them worthy. They are also said to develop precognitive abilities in order to protect their trainers, Espeon become enabled to see into the future to identify potential threats. Eevee evolves into Espeon by having a high happiness level and leveling up during the day. A Sun Shard item can also be used in Pokémon XD, a Sun Ribbon in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue, Red, Explorers of Time, and Explorers of Darkness. Espeon`s name is derived from "ESP" and the suffix "-eon", as with every evolution of Eevee.</description>

<description>Umbreon is one of two Eevee evolutions that first featured in Pokémon Gold and Silver, the other being Espeon. It is called the "Moonlight" Pokémon. It has rabbit-like features displayed strongly in the shape of its head and eyes, a reference to the Japanese idea that you can see the head of a rabbit on the face of the moon. One of Umbreon`s most noticeable features is the yellow rings visible around its body. The Pokédex states that the rings will glow when Umbreon leaps to attack, becomes excited, or when there is a full moon. Umbreon are said to evolve as a result of love for their trainers and the moonlight; forcing one to walk during the day can also cause stress to it. They are described as preferring to lurk in darkness while waiting for their opponents to make the first move. If angered, they can secrete powerful poisonous sweat from their pores.</description>

<description>Murkrow is a small black crow with red eyes. The top of its head is styled as a witch`s hat and its tail bristles out like a broomstick. Murkrow is rather unpopular in the Pokémon world. Its dismal appearance and nocturnal nature have long caused it to be considered an omen of ill fortune to all who see it. If a Murkrow finds itself wounded, it fights back by leading its pursuer to dark mountain trails in an attempt to get him hopelessly lost in the darkness.
Murkrow is also attracted to bright, shiny objects, which it collects to stash in its nest. This, of course, leads to many arguments between Murkrow and Meowth, who both share a common love of stashing things - and taking from each other! It does not hesitate to steal such objects if necessary and has even been known to attempt to snatch rings off their owner`s fingers (and complete strangers too, for that matter). With the addition of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, it is revealed that some Murkrow are servants to its evolved form, Honchkrow, who spends all of its time preening and ordering the Murkrow around. Also with Diamond and Pearl`s release, Murkrow, like many other Pokémon, have gender differences. In this case, Males have a taller "hat" - technically, the crest that resembles a three-pointed witch hat - than females would. Murkrow can only be found wild in the Pokémon Diamond Version in Eterna Forest, while Misdreavus can only be found in Pokémon Pearl at the same location.</description>

Slowking`s appearance is essentially identical to that of Slowpoke, with a few additions: it stands upright, it sports a red-and-white ruff around its neck and it has a bone-like structure on top of its head that is a cross between a helmet and a crown. This is actually a different form of Shellder, similar to the one biting Slowbro`s tail. When Slowking is viewed from behind, the eyes of the Shellder can be seen. The Shellder biting Slowking`s head injects toxins inside its brain every time Slowking yawns. The poisons interact with Slowking`s neural tissue to unlock mental faculties hitherto untapped, making Slowking considerably smarter and more alert than the sluggish Slowpoke or Slowbro. This makes it stand out among the aforementioned species, which recognize it as a leader of sorts.
The anime adds a ritualistic test to select the leader of the Slowpoke and Slowbro. A group of Slowpoke gather in a Shellder-infested lake, at the middle of which laid a King`s Rock. The Slowpoke that manages to dodge the Shellder and avoid evolving into Slowbro make it to the King`s Rock and places it on its head, whereupon a Shellder clamps on the rock, triggering Slowpoke`s evolution into Slowking.
Some Slowking have shown themselves capable of learning human speech, as seen in the movie Pokémon 2000 in which one helps Ash restore order to the world by getting three spheres protected by Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres.</description>

<description>Misdreavus is a moderately-sized, corporeal apparition that somewhat resembles the disembodied head of a human female. It lacks a nose, has thick, flowing "hair", and large, yellow eyes with red irises. It appears to wear a necklace of red pearls. Misdreavus lives deep in dark caves. It projects frightening screeching and wailing noises, as well as creepy, sobbing cries, at enemy Pokemon it encounters in the caves, so as to build up a level of fright strong enough so that the Pokemon will flee. Misdreavus` pearl necklace apparently serves as its means for feeding by absorbing the fearful feelings of targets for nutrition.
In the event that a human, trepid or otherwise, enters a cave area inhabited by a Misdreavus, the Pokemon will attempt to drive him or her out by biting and pulling at the intruding human`s hair, which is used for defense.</description>

<description>Unown is a hieroglyph-like symbol with 28 different forms, based on the letters of the Latin alphabet, a question mark, and an exclamation point. They always have the similarities of a flat body with black color and one medium-size eye. They always reside in mysterious chambers, only with other Unown, always stuck on walls.
Unown is featured in Spell of the Unown as the main antagonists. The Unown create an Entei to befriend a young girl and grant all of the girl`s wishes: in the girl`s case, turning the town she lives in into crystal. Ash and friends convince the girl that Entei is not her true father, since her father was lost on an archeological dig in an Unown temple. The Unown, overpowered by the girl`s current thoughts, became unable to control their powers and larger areas were turning into crystal. Entei saves them all by attacking the Unown, sending them all back to their dimension. It has also been revealed that Dialga and Palkia live in the same dimension as the Unown.</description>

<description>Wobbuffet is a stiff, blue, balloon-shaped Pokémon based on the late Japanese comedian Sanpei Hayashiya (林家三平) (1925-1980). Hayashiya`s trademark routine involved him putting one hand to his forehead and saying "Sou nansu, okusan" (そうなんす, 奥さん) ("So it seems, madam"). This is why, in the Japanese Pokémon anime and movies, Wobbuffet is often seen putting a hand to its forehead and shouting "Soooooonansu!" (which was translated as well for the English adaptation, where it indeed says "Woooooobbuffet!"). It is voiced by Kayzie Rogers.
Wobbuffet hates light and shock, so it lives in the quiet darkness of caves and only comes out at night. If attacked, it inflates its body to bolster its amazing ability to counter-attack using the moves Counter and Mirror Coat, rather than offensive battling like most other Pokémon, for it won`t attack on its own. It does nothing but endure attacks in this fashion, suggesting that Wobbuffet either has an inability to tolerate aggressive behavior on its part, or that it is simply built to withstand attacks. However, it will not endure an attack on its valued, sensitive tail. When that happens, the Pokémon will try to take the foe with it using Destiny Bond. To keep its pitch-black tail hidden from the sight of potential attackers, it lives in black caves and atmospheres as described above.
In the Pokémon anime, Jessie has owned a Wobbuffet ever since she accidentally exchanged her Lickitung for it in the episode Tricks Of The Trade. Wobbuffet is her equivalent of Misty`s Psyduck — it has a habit of popping out of its Pokéball at inopportune times without being called, including at the end of Team Rocket`s motto.</description>

<description>Girafarig is a herbivore that resembles a giraffe. It is yellow with dark brown spots for the front half, while the back half is dark brown with yellow spots. The back section is smaller on the females. Most notably, the end of Girafarig`s tail has a simplistic head. The head has a small brain of its own, but can only rely on instinct. If a person gets near the head, it reacts to the person`s scent and bites. The head doesn`t need to sleep, so it watches over its surroundings twenty four hours a day. Girafarig`s name is a palindrome in both English and Japanese, although the Japanese name`s palindromic nature is not evident in romanised form.</description>

<description>Pineco is a bagworm that resembles a pine cone in appearance. It is usually inactive, hanging from forest trees, where it waits for its prey of small flying insects to come to it. Pineco are capable of spitting out a sticky liquid that hardens when exposed to air. This has multiple uses, an example being Pineco using it to glue pieces of bark to themselves for protection, making them bigger and their hide more durable, much like the bagworm in real life. Like Voltorb and Electrode, Pineco explodes when startled or annoyed.
In the Pokémon anime, Brock catches a Pineco in the episode Goin` Apricorn! to save it from Jessie`s Arbok. It often exploded, no matter what its mood was, but it lost this habit later on when it evolved into a Forretress.</description>

<description>Forretress is a bagworm as classified by the Pokédex, but its true appearance is unknown because it is always hidden inside a steel shell, the only visible part inside being its eyes. The shell itself has two parts: inner and outer. The inner shell is brick red and features four protrusions that look like small cannons. The outer shell is gray and pockmarked, like the surface of the moon. Forretress opens its shell only when it is catching prey, but it does so at such a quick pace that it is impossible to discern the nature of what lies inside, much less attack it while it is unprotected. Forretress can also shoot out bits of the shell for offensive purposes.
In the Pokémon anime, Brock`s Pineco evolves into a Forretress in the episode Entei At Your Own Risk. It is notable for being the only Pokémon he brought with him to Hoenn, and he has since left it at the gym in his hometown of Pewter City.</description>

It has a yellow hourglass shaped body, two tiny wings on its sides, a drill for a tail, and two spikes under its chin. Its underbelly is blue, as well as the markings on its back. Dunsparce lives in caves and deep underground in nests of complex design. Its rudimentary wings enable it to hover just above the ground, providing it with an alternate method of motion besides crawling. Despite these wings and bug-like appearance, Dunsparce is solely a normal type Pokémon.</description>

<description>Gligar is a purple scorpion that is able to glide from a leathery membrane it has that functions as wings. Gligar makes its home on steep cliffs. When it spots prey, it lets go of the cliff`s face, spreads its wings and glides silently and effortlessly towards its target, as if it were sliding. This catches its victim by surprise when it flies straight to its face. It then uses its claws and pincers to secure its hold on the opponent`s face and injects it with poison from its tail barb to paralyze the prey. It is the first Flying-type Pokémon that is unaffected by Electric-type attacks. Ash Ketchum caught this Pokémon.</description>

The male has two spikes on each side of its jaw while the female only has one spike on each side. It is said that an Onix evolves into Steelix when one lives to be 100 or more, then the pressures exercised on its stone body become so high that it is compressed into a composition harder than diamond. Steelix continues to burrow underground like it did as an Onix, but it reaches far greater depths, reaching records of up to 0.6 miles (900 metres) while heading for the Earth`s core.</description>

Another of Snubbull`s personality traits is its cowardice, which it tries to hide behind a gruff exterior. If it feels threatened, Snubbull can bare its fangs and make its appearance intentionally intimidating to terrorize smaller and/or weaker Pokémon into running away. However, Snubbull has also been observed to be a little sad at driving away potential friends like this.</description>

<description>Granbull is a large, purple, bipedal bulldog with a pair of imposing, heavy fangs protruding from its lower jaw. The lower jaw is quite developed and, taken together with the fangs, heavy enough that Granbull must constantly decide between tipping its head back for balance and tilting its head down for decreased energy exertion. As its large mouth and fangs are built specifically for offense, Granbull can bite with a crushing amount of power. Granbull`s vicious appearance is a natural intimidation tactic meant to discourage any other Pokémon from assaulting it. In spite of its appearance, however, it is rather timid and easily spooked, and it only defends itself in retaliation to an assault upon it. When it is attacked by another Pokémon in the wild, Granbull flails about with its limbs to ward off its attacker.</description>

<description>Qwilfish is a porcupinefish-like fish that has a round body with many toxin-containing spikes and a teardrop-shaped tail. The spikes give it trouble swimming, but it also has defensive measures against predators. Qwilfish can swallow large quantities of water in very short notice, causing itself to inflate to a much larger size, which it uses to intimidate larger opponents. If the opponent isn`t scared, Qwilfish uses the pressure of the water it swallowed to shoot out its toxic spikes at, thus weakening, the opponent.</description>

<description>Scizor is a human-size mantis similar to its evolutionary predecessor Scyther, with a thick, metallic red exoskeleton and crab-like claws. It is tougher and stronger than Scyther, but has lost its predecessor`s speed and ability to fly. Instead, it spreads its wings to cool off, and flaps them very rapidly to heat up, or to blow air to cool itself off. Its demeanor changes, as well. While Scyther is a mantis-like predator, striking fast and simply evading potential pursuers, Scizor is more crab-like, with a conservative, defensive demeanor, in keeping with its greater defensive ability and lesser speed. Once it engages its foe, either in the wild or at the direction of a Pokémon Trainer in a Pokémon battle, however, it behaves more like Scyther, striking quickly with its powerful claws, raking more than pinching, and relying on its startling agility to evade attacks.</description>

Its soft yellow body has four legs and is covered by a hard, vase-like red shell which has eight openings for Shuckle to stick its head and four appendages out of. It makes its home amid rocks, withdrawing into its rock-like shell and hiding among, under or within them. Shuckle employs a fluid secreted by its toes to dissolve rocks and carve them in a shape fit for its nest, the fluids are also occasionally used offensively against enemy Pokémon. Shuckle`s diet consists of berries, which it stores inside its shell to eat later. If stored long enough, the berries will eventually decompose and mix with Shuckle`s natural fluids to form a viscous liquid that makes a healing beverage aptly called "berry juice".It also notably has the best defence/special defence through the game.</description>

Growing from its head is a large T-shaped horn, which is flanked on either side by a smaller antenna. Heracross is a powerful but docile Pokémon. Its natural habitat is forests and its diet consists of tree sap, nectar and honey. Its strength is such that it can topple large trees if it so wished. Heracross`s main weapon is its large horn, of which it is particularly proud. However, it only uses it in the wild to deter its foes, not hurt them.
In the Pokémon anime, Ash catches a Heracross in the episode A Sappy Ending. The Heracross is powerful, but also is distracted by sap, to the point where it tries to feed off the nectar of Ash`s Bulbasaur`s flower bulb when Bulbasaur is in sight. It is currently at Professor Oak`s lab.</description>

Ursaring can hibernate through an entire winter without any food. Ursaring`s sense of smell is among the most developed of all Pokémon; it can detect subtle differences in scents. For this reason, Ursaring is sometimes used by police in the Pokémon universe, both as a strong enforcer, and as an explosive-sniffing Pokémon. If criminals are hiding in trees, it can use its claws to cut down the tree.
Its Japanese name, "Ringuma", originates from "ring" (ringu) and "bear" (kuma). In the anime, Ursaring is caught by Paul, after it is angered by Turtwig.</description>

<description>Magcargo is a snail composed of magma with a shell on its back. The shell is actually a thin outgrowth of its skin that hardened due to cooling of the air, in spite of the fact that it lives in the heat of volcanic craters. The shell is brittle and fragile enough that touching it will cause it to break and crumble, though Magcargo "grows" back its shell passively in a short amount of time. Magcargo has a body temperature of approximately 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Since Magcargo is composed of molten lava, when traveling at its slow pace it leaves parts of its continually hardening body on the ground behind it, thus decreasing its physical size. To lose too much of its mass is potentially deadly, so Magcargo routinely restores its size and vitality by dipping its body into volcanic pools of magma.</description>

<description>Corsola is a dual-type Water/Rock Pokémon introduced in Generation II.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
In Galar, Corsola has a Ghost-type regional form. It evolves into Cursola starting at level 38.
Corsola is a small, pink, roundish Pokémon with branch-like growths on its back, which are similar to coral. There is a smaller, blunt horn on its forehead, and it has black, oval eyes. It has a white underside, which speckles towards the sides. Its four legs and two arms are blunt and stubby.
Found in the warm shallow waters of southern seas, Corsola requires clean water to live. If its habitat is dirty, the growths on its back become discolored and degenerate. However, when it is healthy, its growths regularly shed and grow back. It is able to regrow them over the course of a single night. It forms large social groups. Occasionally, these groups get so large that people may live atop them, as is the case in Pacifidlog Town. Corsola`s horn is a prized material, commonly used for jewelry and carving as seen in the anime. Smaller Pokémon like Seadra and Luvdisc are sometimes sheltered by Corsola`s branches, and even offer it protection from foes.
Galarian Corsola were wiped out by sudden changes in ocean temperature caused by a meteor impact, turning them into Ghost-types. Its body is a bleached white with half-closed pink eyes and a perpetual frown, and its arms and branches have a distinctly semitransparent appearance to them; the branches can be used to take root inside and drain the life force of others.
The branches cannot cause injures or pain, but they immobilize the victim until Galarian Corsola lets them go. They are commonly found in the remains of prehistoric seas, and while they can be mistaken for ordinary rocks, they will curse anybody who kicks them by accident.
In the Alola region, Mareanie and Toxapex are natural predators of Corsola. However, they do not fulfill those roles in the Galar region, having not realized the branches of Corsola are delicious.</description>

<description>Remoraid is a Remora-based suckerfish that scavenges for food and has a somewhat symbiotic relationship with Mantine. Remoraid will attach itself to the underbelly of Mantine with its dorsal fin, eating scraps of food that Mantine drops as well as the parasites on them that causes them to itch. In return, the Mantine helps defend the Remoraid from enemies. When not scavenging for food, Remoraid will strike down its own prey with precise accuracy using fast streams of airborne water, which Remoraid shoots from its mouth using abdominal muscles. Remoraid can move faster through the water by blasting water from its mouth in the opposite direction of where it intends to move.</description>

<description>Delibird resembles the rockhopper penguin, or possibly a snowy owl. It has red and white plumage and is always pictured carrying a sack with it, giving it a Santa Claus-like impression, although its "sack" is actually a long wavery tail, like a ribbon. Delibird is said to make its home at the edge of steep cliffs. It spends all day searching for food, which it stores in its sack/tail and brings back to its chicks. Delibird are known to save the lives of many lost and starved mountaineers by sharing their food with them.
On the other hand, a Delibird under attack will fling its stored food at the opponent as a projectile weapon. This is perhaps the basis for its signature attack, Present, which is an attack only Delibird can learn, as well as the only attack Delibird can learn naturally (through leveling up). In the video games, Delibird is a relatively rare Pokémon; it appears in icy caves, during swarms in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, and as a Shadow Pokémon in Pokémon Colosseum. Delibird can also be caught in Icefall Cave on Four Island of the Sevii Islands, only in Fire Red.
Delibird`s anime debut was in the episode "Dues and Don`ts," in which a Delibird belonging to Team Rocket follows Jessie, James, and Meowth around under orders to collect the enormous debt the three have amassed during the years with constant requests for Pokémon-shaped mechas and other devices. This Delibird appears in several episodes in the series set in Johto. Another Delibird, a helper of Santa Claus, appeared in "Delibird`s Present," an episode of the Pikachu`s Winter Vacation 3 holiday special also shown as part of Pokémon Chronicles.</description>

<description>Houndoom live in packs, whose leader is decided by fierce fighting among its members. The leader develops horns sharply raked towards its back to display its dominant status. A Houndoom`s body is filled with volatile toxins that ignite when exposed to air, causing pungent-smelling flames to be shot. The flame will cause persistent pain that can never be alleviated. Houndoom is a feared predator among Pokémon, with its howl being likened to the howl of the Grim Reaper in legend. Just the sound of its howl is enough to send all other Pokémon which hear it hurrying back to the safety of their nests.</description>

<description>Phanpy is a midget-size elephant that has a large snout that serves various purposes. Its large ears act as fans to cool it down. Phanpy possesses the strength to lift an adult human; playful behavior with one may prove dangerous. It lives in nests that are vertical holes dug at a river`s shore. The area around the nest is claimed by Phanpy by marking it with its trunk, warning other Pokémon to keep out. In the mornings, Phanpy uses its trunk by the river`s edge to give itself a shower. When many Phanpy gather, they soak each other wet with their trunks, and dry at the edge of the water.</description>

<description>Porygon2 is an improved version of its pre-evolution Porygon. It has enhanced abilities, including increased potency in combat. As opposed to most evolved Pokemon, Porygon2 is shorter and lighter than Porygon. Its artificial intelligence has been developed to such a degree as to give it the capacity to learn on its own from its surroundings and experiences. This results in Porygon2 occasionally exhibiting behavior or motions that were not included in its original programming. Porygon2 was originally intended to be used as a space probe. Unfortunately, since it cannot fly, such an application has been abandoned. Silph Co. seems to have fixed that problem in Pokemon Diamond and Pearl; Porygon`s evolved form, Porygon-Z, can hover above the ground.
Porygon2 evolves from a Porygon that has been traded while holding the Up-Grade item, and will evolve into Porygon Z if it is traded while holding the Dubious Disc item. Porygon2 also makes two cameos in the fighting game Super Smash Bros. Melee. It is one of an assortment of Pokemon that can emerge from a Poke Ball item, and a collectible Porygon2 trophy can also be obtained.
Porygon2 has never appeared in the Pokemon anime, due to the controversial Pokemon episode: Dennou Senshi Porygon.</description>

<description>Stantler is a Pokémon with large, curved antlers. These antlers change the flow of the air, causing the space around them to act as a distorted reality, and leaving other beings around the Stantler confused and lost in their senses. This allows it to create hallucinations to aid it in battle or allow it to escape. The antlers are considered art in the Pokémon world, causing the Stantler to almost be hunted to extinction as the trading market of the antlers reached very high prices. The orbs on fallen antlers is often grounded up to a powder that helps people sleep. Stantler`s name is derived from stag, meaning a male deer, and antler, referring to the horn-like growths on its head.</description>

<description>Smeargle is the painter of the Pokémon world, best known for its unique "Sketch" attack. It has a long tail that ends in a tuft of fur similar to a paintbrush. The tuft is continuously soaked by a special fluid secreted from the tip of the tail. The color of the fluid is predetermined for each Smeargle. The fluid is used to mark the boundaries of its territory and print its footprints on the backs of its fellows once they reach maturity. Over 5,000 distinctive marks left by the species have been found in the Pokémon world.
Smeargle has its "Sketch" technique, which is unique to Smeargle. When used, it will replace itself permanently with the last attack technique used by an opponent Pokémon against Smeargle. It learns Sketch every ten levels. There are a few attacks Sketch cannot copy, (Such as Chatots main attack Chatter) but it can learn nearly every attack in the game.</description>

<description>Tyrogue is a fighting Pokémon with three different evolutions, the first generation`s Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan, and one introduced in the same generation, Hitmontop. The Pokémon that it evolves into is based upon the attack and defense statistics of the Tyrogue at the point of evolution. Tyrogue is very energetic; it puts this energy into training. It constantly challenges, or randomly attacks, different Pokémon in order to get stronger, though it often ends up with injuries caused by much stronger Pokémon. Even if it loses, it will never give up on its training. If a captive Tyrogue doesn`t have various set training methods established by its trainer, it will often become stressed. Tyrogue and its evolutions are based as all male.</description>

<description>Hitmontop has a sharp point on the top of its head which allows it to balance itself upside-down on its head, the position which it holds in much of the time while it is observed. While it can walk upright, it often travels by spinning like a top, letting it travel much faster. Using the centrifugal force to boost its attack by ten times, it launches elegant kicks while spinning. This allows it to throw off its opponent`s timing, and give it a good mix of offense and defense. If it spins fast enough, it can dig into the ground. Any punch or hand based moves breed into or learned by a Tyrogue will carry into either of its evolved forms. This means that even a Hitmontop can know a move like Mach Punch or High Jump Kick.</description>

They are awakened in this tower in their first appearance. Another myth maintains that Raikou descended to earth together with a lightning bolt. Each Beast personifies a force of nature - Raikou, in particular, embodies the speed of lightning.
Like many Electric-type Pokémon, Raikou stores tremendous energy inside its body. This grants it extraordinary vitality, allowing it to run continuously across the land while shooting off electricity from the rain cloud that is on its back. Raikou`s roar is aptly described as "thunderous": it is loud enough to create shock waves and shake the ground as if actual thunder had struck.
Raikou is featured in a special anime episode called Raikou - The Legend of Thunder that forms the first three episodes of Pokémon Chronicles. In the special, two Team Rocket agents named Attila and Hun scheme to capture Raikou with a device that reflects and deflects energy blasts. Three New Bark Town trainers risk their own lives to try and save Raikou. It is thought by the trainers that Raikou attempts to guard other electric Pokémon from danger whenever possible.</description>

Entei is an embodiment of magma, being able to launch powerfully searing, fire that is hotter than magma from its mouth. This fire consumes everything that it touches. When it roars, volcanos around it are apparently triggered to erupt. Due to being unable to fully control its own power, it constantly sprints around the world.
Entei is the main Pokémon in the movie Pokémon the Movie 3: Spell of the Unown, in which the Unown create it from Molly`s imagination.</description>

However, on the way, the egg hatches, and Larvitar was born. Soon afterwards, Professor Elm asks Ash and company to return Larvitar to its home in Mt. Silver. It doesn`t open up to anyone except Ash and Pikachu, who nurse it from sickness. This is due to its abduction by a gang of Pokémon poachers as well as the physical harm they caused to its mother, Tyranitar. It eventually opens up to others, and is returned to its mother on Mt.

<description>Lugia is a legendary Pokémon that first appears in Pokémon Gold and Silver, appearing on the boxart for Silver. Lugia, thought to be the guardian of the sea, resides deep in the ocean floor. It spends most of its time at the bottom of the sea due to its tremendous power, which includes being able to topple houses just by flapping its large, powerful wings and the ability to start storms that can last for over forty days. It is usually seen near the beginning of storms, and it often uses its wings to calm them.
It plays the role of a general legendary Pokémon in some games, where it waits in a far-off location, ready to battle. Lugia is one of the main characters of Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness. The storyline of the game depicts a "Shadow" Lugia terrorizing the locals and wreaking havoc. It is the only Shadow Pokémon whose physical appearance is different from its regular state. Shadow Lugia is said to be struggling, asking for help to free it from doing Cipher`s work in which "its deeper closed heart refuses to do". The player has to catch and Purify it for it to return to its original state.
In Pokémon: The Movie 2000, Lugia comes from the sea when the three Legendary Birds Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres are roused by a Pokémon collector who tries to catch the trio. Lugia then battles the raging Birds and, with the help of Ash and Team Rocket, manages to calm them and restore peace to nature. Lugia makes a second appearance in the Pokémon TV series when the protagonist, Ash, travels to the Whirl Islands where he meets his friend Richie to help stop a Team Rocket scientist from separating a young Lugia named "Silver" from her parent.</description>

Long ago in Ecruteak City, there were two towers, the Brass Tower and Tin Tower being the roost of Lugia and Ho-Oh, respectively. When the Brass Tower burned down, both Pokémon fled, never to be seen again. Three Pokémon became trapped in the flames of the Brass Tower and perished. Ho-Oh returned to the Burned Tower and resurrected the three Pokémon, who were renamed Raikou, Entei, and Suicune. It has an unknown gender. On Gold, it is Lv40 when caught while it is Lv70 when caught in Silver. It is better to have the lower version as the move tutor does not exist in Gold/Silver.
It is called the Rainbow Pokémon due to its various associations with rainbows. Its feathers constantly change through the rainbow`s spectrum of colors as light hits them from different angles. These leave a rainbow trail as it flies continuously through the world`s skies, though it is said to live at the foot of a rainbow. It is said to appear before pure-hearted trainers as the representative of the bonds between humans and Pokémon, and bring happiness to all that see it. This is expanded upon in the anime, where it is said to appear before a hero. Ash Ketchum sees Ho-Oh various times throughout his journey, the first time being before Gold and Silver were even announced. It remained a mystery until it was revealed in Pokémon Gold.</description>

It wanders through time, visiting various undisturbed old-growth forests during peaceful times, leaving behind flourishing grass and trees. It often leaves behind an egg that it brought from the future. Celebi`s continuing existence signifies a good future.
Celebi cannot be captured in any English version of the Pokémon video games; however, it can be obtained at Nintendo promotional giveaway events. In Pokémon Colosseum, the power of Celebi is used to purify Shadow Pokémon. When one of the three Time Flutes in the game is used, Celebi will appear and purify a Shadow Pokémon instantly. Once all 48 Shadow Pokémon have been purified trainers playing the Japanese version of the game can obtain Celebi via the bonus disc that comes with Colosseum. On the North-American version, Celebi is replaced by Jirachi.
Despite being a legendary Pokémon, Celebi has fairly low stats, and its Psychic/Grass type cross means that 7 different types are "Super effective" against it, including a 4x weakness to Bug-types.
In the anime, Celebi is represented as a generally weak Pokémon that constantly needs protection. Celebi is one of the main characters in the movie Pokémon 4Ever. In this movie, Celebi is running away from a hunter. It crashes into young Samuel Oak who protects it, and in return, Celebi transports them forty years into the future, where Sam teams up with Ash Ketchum to save Celebi from a Team Rocket member who turns it into a Dark Celebi by capturing it in a Dark Poké Ball. Near the end of the movie, several dozen Celebi appear from all sorts of different eras in time to help out. It also makes appearances in various episodes.
In Pokemon Mystery Dungeon 2, a shiny Celebi helps a Grovyle and the Main protagonist return to their world from the future. After this, she vanishes because the future she was a part of ceased to exist due to the character stopping Primal Dialga.</description>

The leaves that grow out of Grovyle`s body, as well as its matching green coloration, provide excellent camouflage against the background of its native habitats, the forests and jungles. But even if spotted, Grovyle has little trouble escaping danger. Its powerful thigh muscles make it very adept at climbing trees and jumping from branch to branch very quickly, disappearing into the forest and eluding its pursuers.
In the anime, Ash Ketchum`s Treecko evolves into Grovyle. Its personality does not change much; Grovyle is as much of a loner as Treecko was, and it loves the challenge of a battle. It also habitually keeps a twig in its mouth, although larger than the one it used to keep as a Treecko. When Ash returns to Kanto to take the Battle Frontier challenge, Grovyle is one of the Pokémon he takes with him. Ash continues to use Grovyle until its evolution into Sceptile.</description>

Sceptile`s bodies are configured for battling prowess and superior mobility in jungle environments, with large, sharp leaves protruding from their arms and legs that can easily cut large trees. As caretakers of the forest, these Pokémon carefully grow trees and plants with loving care. The orb-like seeds on a Sceptile`s back are filled to the brim with nutrients, which Sceptile use to revitalize the trees in their care. Sceptile regulate their body temperature by basking in sunlight.
In the anime Battle Frontier saga, Ash`s Grovyle evolves into a Sceptile during a battle with a Tropius. Even after evolution, Sceptile retains its rebellious personality. Ash`s Sceptile is initially unable to use any attacks, due to the psychological impact of a Meganium`s rejection. However, it regains the ability to use its attacks, and it later learns the SolarBeam attack.</description>

Combusken`s legs are both fast and powerful, and to keep them at peak physical condition, many run through nearby fields and mountains to stay agile and strong. By doing this, Combusken can kick up to 10 times per second, not giving up easily. Like Torchic, Combusken has a place within its body that stores and produces incredibly hot flames, It allows it to spew flames from its beak and to kick continuously until an opponent either faints or gives up.
In the anime, May owned a Combusken that evolved from her Torchic to protect Ash`s Corphish, and it later evolved into a Blaziken.</description>

<description>Blaziken is the third evolution of Torchic, one of the Hoenn starters. The flames burning on its wrists will blaze intensely during its battles, and become stronger as Blaziken exerts itself. Its legs also allow it to leap over skyscrapers thirty stories high. Blaziken can dish out powerful kicks in just one second. After years of using martial arts, its feathers may burn off from the intense heat in its body. Newer, healthier feathers will grow in their place. They can spray flames from their toes with devastating effect.
In the anime, May`s Combusken evolves into a Blaziken. May goes on to use her Blaziken in the final Pokémon Contest battle against Ash`s Sceptile, ending in a draw.</description>

<description>Mudkip, known as the "Mud Fish" species of Pokémon, are featured as one of the selectable starter Pokémon in the third generation of the series. They are small blue Pokémon with a large fin on their head that allows them to sense movements within the air and water, acting as a radar. While in the water, they use the orange, spiky gills on their cheeks to breathe while using their large tail fin to propel themselves. They are extremely strong, despite their small bodies; they are able to lift large boulders by planting all four feet and heaving, and easily crush them. When it comes time to sleep, they bury themselves within the soil at the edge of the water. In the anime, Brock obtains a Mudkip at Dewford Island, which later evolves into a Marshtomp.
The phrase "So i herd u liek mudkipz" has become an Internet meme following its initial appearance on the imageboard 4chan. The meme has resulted in a large number of tribute videos on YouTube.</description>

<description>Marshtomp is the mudskipper-like evolved form of Mudkip. The surface of Marshtomp`s body is enveloped by a thin, sticky film that enables it to live on land. Because it weakens if its skin dries out, it replenishes fluids by playing in mud. Its hindquarters exhibit development, giving it the ability to walk on just its hind legs. Like Mudkip, it can use the fin on its head to navigate.
In the Pokémon anime, Brock has a Marshtomp that evolved from a Mudkip he caught that is currently at his hometown in Pewter City.</description>

<description>Swampert lives and makes its nest offshore on various beaches. It has various abilities that allow it to live without fear of being targeted as prey. It has powerful vision that can see through even the depths of murky water. Its three fins sense subtle changes in the sounds and patterns of ocean waves and tidal winds to predict the oncoming of storms and tidal waves, respectively. Its great strength, allowing it to procure and drag boulders that can weigh a ton, lets it pile up boulders around its beach nest in order to weather the storms that it may predict. With its strength and its rock-hard arms, it can easily batter down a foe with a single swing and pull ships while swimming faster than a jet ski.</description>

It is an omnivore, able to eat almost anything, and it will attempt to take a bite out of anything that moves when it first sees it. This Pokémon is both aggressive and cowardly; it chases after prey until the victim becomes exhausted, but if the prey strikes back, Poochyena may turn tail and run away.</description>

<description>Mightyena is the larger and stronger evolved form of Poochyena. It is a carnivore with characteristics of hyenas and wolves, and a monochrome appearance. Mightyena inhabit wide grasslands in the Pokemon world. They live and hunt in packs, and never defy the orders of their leader, the alpha male of the pack; thanks to the leader`s experience in battle tactics, the pack defeats foes with perfectly coordinated teamwork. This unquestioning loyalty transfers over to when Mightyena are owned by Pokemon trainers, but the Mightyena will only obey the orders of a trainer it recognizes as possessing superior skill.
Mightyena are naturally quick to attack; they chase down their prey and nip until the target can no longer run. In the event that an individual Mightyena encounters a threatening foe, it gives obvious signals when it is preparing to attack; It starts to growl deeply and then flattens its body before biting savagely.</description>

<description>Zigzagoon is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation III.
It evolves into Linoone starting at level 20.
In Galar, Zigzagoon has a Dark/Normal-type regional form. It evolves into Galarian Linoone starting at level 20, which evolves into Obstagoon when leveled up at night starting at level 35.
Zigzagoon is a raccoon-like, quadruped Pokémon with bristly, zigzag-patterned fur. It has stripes formed by alternating layers of cream and brown fur. It has a brown head with spiky ears and a black nose. A black, mask pattern surrounds its brown eyes. The upper half of its mouth is jagged, and when it is open, there are two pointed teeth in its lower jaw. Its feet have three claws and pink paw pads. Its forefeet are cream-colored, but the hind feet are brown. Its brush tail is spiky and bristly.
In Galar, the oldest and original form of Zigzagoon have a more black and white patterned-fur. The red eyes are surrounded by a black spiked mask. The black feet contains three sharp white claws. It has a long pink tongue that is constantly standing outside of mouth with two lower teeth in between.
Zigzagoon is abundantly curious, as it wanders restlessly back and forth while rubbing its nose to the ground in search of something. It rubs its bristly back hair against trees to mark its territory, and plays dead to fool opponents in battle. Zigzagoon is found commonly in grassy fields. The Zigzagoon in Galar are known to be constantly on the move and never settling down. It is believed that the zigzag movements of the Zigzagoon from other regions originated from its Galar relatives. They enjoy battling to the point they often attempt to prove others into fighting it. While this succeeded with other Pokémon, humans instead mistaken it wanting affection, much to the Zigzagoon`s frustrations.</description>

<description>Linoone is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation III.
It evolves from Zigzagoon starting at level 20.
In Galar, Linoone has a Dark/Normal-type regional form. It evolves from Galarian Zigzagoon starting at level 20 and evolves into Obstagoon when leveled up at night starting at level 35.
Linoone is a slender-bodied, quadruped Pokémon. Most of its fur is white, but it has several brown stripes. One long stripe stretches the length of its body before ending in an arrowhead shape on its forehead. The are additional stripes on each side of its bushy tail and on its cheeks. It has sharp, elongated claws and small pointed teeth. It has small, tuft-like ears, long cheek fur, and blue eyes.
Linoone can run up to 60 miles per hour, but has to stop before it can make a turn. It often fails to catch prey due to only being able to run in a straight line. When it sees prey underwater in ponds, it leaps in and uses its sharp claws to catch the prey. As shown in the anime, Linoone has an attraction to anything round, and will grab any orb-shaped object it sees if given the chance. It often carries a snatched object in its expandable cheek pouches and deposits it in any of a number of secret stashes it keep on its territory. Linoone tends to live in grasslands.
In Galar, Linoone has a black and white color scheme due to harsh environment in the region among with competition. This allows its survival instinct to improve, leading to the ability to evolve into Obstagoon. Its eyes are red while covered with a stripe shaped like a shooting star. It has longer claws with grey fur surrounding the front feet. It also has sharp teeth on the upper mouth with a long red tongue sticking out.
Galarian Linoone are know to be rash and fearless. It prefers recklessly challenging opponents that are stronger than itself. Linoone is known to use its long tongue to taunt opponents. Once the foe is fully enraged, Linoone will hurl itself at the opponent, tackling them by force. These traits make Galarian Linoone very popular among unhappy and angry youths in Galar, who have nowhere to take out their anger and frustrations on. By charging at up to 60 miles per hour, it can deliver powerful Tackles and Headbutts with enough destructive force to even knock away a car. Linoone can be thrown off balance should it miss, however.</description>

<description>Wurmple is a larval Pokémon common in both the Hoenn region and the Sinnoh region. It can be considered the modern counterpart to earlier larval Pokémon species Caterpie and Weedle. A common target for avian Pokémon such as Swellow and Staravia, the generally weak Wurmple attempts to defend itself with the spikes on its tail and head which secrete poison, and it can spit slimy thread to slow down opponents. Otherwise, Wurmple feeds by peeling the bark off trees and feeds on the oozing sap. Its feet are tipped with suction pads that allow it to cling to glass without slipping. Wurmple can evolve into either Cascoon or Silcoon (Silcoon---Beautifly and Cascoon---Dustox) depending on what kind of trainer is training it.
In the Pokémon anime, recurring female trainers May and Jessie each catch a Wurmple, and their rivalry is reflected in the differing forms the Wurmple evolve into; May`s Wurmple becomes a Silcoon that eventually evolves into a Beautifly, while Jessie`s Wurmple becomes a Cascoon that eventually evolves into a Dustox.</description>

<description>Silcoon is a cocoon Pokémon form that Wurmple can take. It can be considered a modern counterpart to earlier cocoon Pokémon species Metapod and Kakuna, but it is definitely the physical counterpart to Cascoon, an alternative cocoon form that Wurmple can take instead at random. Silcoon is a semi-mobile ellipsoid ball of white silk where the eyes of the mutating Pokémon inside are visible looking out. It hangs on tree branches awaiting evolution into its Beautifly form, during which it conserves energy by moving as little as possible, feeding on rainwater that is collected by its silk outgrowths, and generally keeping a constant watch over its surroundings for threats.
In the Pokémon anime, trainer May `s Wurmple evolves into the Silcoon stage and then the Beautifly stage shortly after, as opposed to Jessie`s Wurmple becoming a Cascoon and then a Dustox.</description>

It can be considered a modern counterpart to the earlier butterfly Pokémon species Butterfree, but it is definitely the physical counterpart to Dustox, the other form into which a Wurmple can eventually evolve. Beautifly is a very vain and colorful butterfly with a long, coiled, needle-like mouth not unlike the proboscis of a real butterfly, which it uses both for gathering pollen in the wild and, despite their gentle appearance, for aggressively attacking opponent Pokémon when angered. It is most active in the springtime, where it rides the spring winds as it flits around gathering pollen from flower-covered fields, or from potted flowers left on windowsills.
In the Pokémon anime, Beautifly becomes May`s primary Pokémon for use in Pokémon contests early on, and Jessie`s Dustox is established as its rival.</description>

Cascoon is a semi-mobile ellipsoid ball of purple silk where the eyes of the mutating Pokémon inside are visible looking out. It hides away from predators in the wild using the more crafty method of covering its body with large, dead leaves. Its initially soft body hardens over time and begins to crack when it nears evolution into Dustox, and at this point it will do nothing in order to conserve its energy, even if it is attacked.

<description>Dustox is a moth-like Pokémon and one of two flying insect Pokémon forms that Wurmple can eventually evolve into, the other being Beautifly. Dustox`s green wings are coated with a fine and powerfully toxic dust which it uses to defend itself and deter bird Pokémon that might attack it. It feeds on leaves on trees it seeks out with its radar-like antennae, and it is instinctively attracted to bright light like many real moths. Swarms of Dustox can end up attracted to the bright lights of major cities at night, and end up causing unintentional havoc with the trees of those cities.
In the Pokémon anime, Dustox becomes Jesse`s primary Pokémon for use in Pokémon contests early on, and is often treated as a rival to May`s Beautifly. Jessie often tries to cheat with her Dustox, however, they still seem to always lose to May`s Beautifly. Jessie later releases Dustox so it could be with its mate.</description>

<description>Lotad is both an aquatic and a land-dwelling Pokémon, found in the Hoenn region, with a lilypad growing on its back. This species lives in groups at ponds, with their bodies submerged while suspended at the surface by their buoyant leaves, as a measure of hiding from predators. When on dry land, Lotad scuttles towards other ponds because its leaf is too heavy to support, in contrast to Lotad`s ancient ancestors which were one primarily land-dwelling Pokémon. Lotad and its evolved forms have mouths resembling duck bills, which may be a pun on the duckweed.
In the Pokémon anime, a Lotad becomes one of the Pokémon in trainer Brock`s possession in the third-generation Hoenn story arc in a development considered ironic because previously Brock primarily used Pokémon of the Rock and Ground types. His Lotad eventually evolved into Lombre, and then Ludicolo.</description>

Lombre is a nocturnal Pokémon found in the Hoenn region, whose lilypad, carried over from its Lotad stage, is now attached to its head like a hat. Lombre`s entire body is covered by a slippery, slimy film. It feels horribly unpleasant to be touched by this Pokémon`s hands. It feeds on aquatic moss that grows in the riverbed. It is also a mischief-maker: When a Lombre spots anglers, it will tug on their fishing lines from beneath the surface and enjoy their consternation. It also takes great delight in popping out of rivers and startling people.
In the Pokémon anime, the Lotad in trainer Brock`s possession during the third-generation Hoenn story arc evolves into a Lombre over time, and later on into a Ludicolo. As a Lombre, Brock`s is quirky and dense.</description>

Ludicolo is a large, bipedal creature with a duck-like mouth on its body which looks like a pineapple, and the lilypad on its head carried over from its previous stages of Pokémon evolution resembles a sombrero hat, and pancho-colored plumage. Ludicolo can derive much energy and vitality from cheerful and upbeat music. Upon hearing such music, for example during festivities or mountain hiking expeditions, Ludicolo is driven into the open and starts dancing rhythmically. The principle behind this phenomenon is that the melodious sound waves are supposed to stimulate Ludicolo`s cells into making it more powerful.
In the Pokémon anime, the Lombre in trainer Brock`s possession during the third-generation Hoenn story arc evolves into a Ludicolo. Like many of the Ludicolo species, Brock`s Ludicolo is very cheerful and is frequently seen dancing joyfully around.</description>

It apparently appreciates this fact because it enjoys startling Pidgey foraging in the area by suddenly moving.

Its long and pointed nose is its weak point, and it loses power if the nose is gripped. For this reason, it dislikes having its long nose pinched. Nuzleaf will sometimes pull out the leaf on its head and make a flute with it. The sound of Nuzleaf`s flute strikes fear and uncertainty in the hearts of people lost in a forest. This is a reference to Pan, the Greek god of the forest.</description>

Shiftry`s appearance is based on the Tengu of Japanese mythology, with a long nose, white hair, feet resembling Geta sandals, and large fan-like hands being elements based on how Tengu are commonly portrayed. It is a mysterious entity in the Pokémon world said to arrive by the chilly winds of Winter, and it is said to be a fearsome guardian of the deep forests it holds sway over from its homes on the tops of toweringly tall trees in dark forests. Its hand fans, which are larger on males than on females, are capable of whipping 100-mph gusts of wind, and it possesses a degree of Extra-sensory perception, able to read its foe`s mind and take preemptive actions most other Pokemon would be unable to do in time. Nuzleaf is a generally strong pokemon but doesnt learn any "good" attacks until it reaches a generally high level.</description>

<description>Taillow is a common bird Pokémon species found in the Hoenn region. Its Japanese name comes from tsubame (swallow). It is a migratory bird that dislikes cold seasons. It migrates to other lands in search of warmth, flying over 180 miles a day on some occasions. It will courageously stand their ground against foes, taking on Pokémon like Skarmory with an equal footing. This gutsy Pokémon will remain defiant even after a loss. This however is in stark contrast to when it becomes hungry; it cries loudly. As a result of its relative youth, it sometimes becomes lonely and cries at night. It feeds on Wurmple that live in forests.

It never misses its targets in this respect. Swellow is quite fastidious with its own body, especially its wings. When it is not cleaning its wings and tail feathers regularly, two Swellow are gathered together and unhesitantly take it upon themselves to clean each other`s wings. A Swellow`s tail feathers indicate that the individual is healthy if the feathers are standing at attention. Though it`s name suggests it`s based on a swallow, Swellow has many characteristics of a falcon
In the Pokemon anime, main trainer Ash Ketchum owned a Swellow, and he used it prominently throughout his journey in Hoenn.</description>

If the trainer is cheerful and happy, Kirlia will also be happy, and will spin and dance. The happier the trainer is, the more beautiful Kirlia will become. Likewise, a heartless trainer will result in a weak and saddened Kirlia, and its powers will have decreased significantly.</description>

It moves by levitating itself, and can ignore gravity. Its powers are strong enough to the point where Gardevoir can disrupt the space-time continuum. By doing so, it can create a miniature black hole. Gardevoir has an unparalleled sense of concern for its Pokémon trainer, such that it will even give its own life for its trainer. The psychic powers that Gardevoir wields are at its height when it is protecting its trainer from a threat. In Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire and Pokémon Emerald, Wally uses a Gardevoir in the final battle in Victory Road.

<description>Surskit is a bug-like species of Pokémon based on the water strider insect. It was introduced in the third generation of Pokémon media in the fictional Hoenn region. Surskit frequents lakes and ponds, and it has the ability to walk, or at least glide, on the water`s surface thanks to an oily substance secreted from the tips of its feet which modifies the water`s surface tension, thus allowing the water to support its weight. Surskit`s diet consists of the microscopic organisms that are found at the base of a lake ecosystem`s food chain. Surskit can also secrete a thick, sweet syrup resembling honey from the tip of its head. This sap is said to appeal to some species of Pokémon such as Heracross. Surskit usually secretes the syrup when it finds itself in danger. The exact reasoning behind this is unclear, but it may aim at attracting Pokémon which will drive the danger away to lick the syrup off Surskit`s head.</description>

<description>Masquerain is an insectoid species of Pokémon that is the larger and more developed evolved form that a Surskit can metamorph into. Masquerain`s appearance is configured to resemble to a degree a large, scary face, with its two giant orange antennae resembling eyes and its red face and two black eyes resembling a red mouth with two black teeth. This serves as an intimidation tactic to ward off potential predators. The four parallelogram-shaped appendages on its bottom are its real wings, and their fast flapping motions give Masquerain the ability to fly forwards, sideways, and backwards like a helicopter. Masquerain can`t fly in rain, so it therefore shelters itself under large trees and leaves.</description>

<description>Shroomish is a mushroom-like Pokémon species found in the Hoenn region. It has small feet protruding from the bottom of its body. Shroomish subsist on a diet of damp, composted soil, and can be seen feeding on it in swarms following rain storms. They produce a toxic spore from glands on its cap.</description>

<description>Breloom is the larger and more developed evolved form that a Shroomish can metamorph into. This diurnal herbivore that lives in fields and forests with leaves for Breloom to feed on. Its favorite climate conditions are sunlight-induced warmth and humidity, which is when Breloom is at its most active. Breloom`s body is configured for battling opponents in a competitive boxing fashion. Its stretchable arms are capable of extremely quick, rapid-fire punches that are virtually invisible, putting professional human boxers to shame (compare with Hitmonchan).
Spores are located within Breloom`s toadstool cap, and Breloom sprays and scatters these spores out of the red holes on its cap as its tool to debilitate and poison opponents. Also toxically sporous are the seeds on Breloom`s tail, which sometimes drop off and are grown back. These seeds let loose their sporous contents when Breloom thwacks an opponent with its tail, making the foe even more at risk of succumbing to poisoning. These seeds are horrid things to consume; a mere bite out of one of these seeds that may be lying around on the forest floor will cause the consumer`s stomach to rumble.
Breloom is notable as one of two final-form Pokemon to receive the attack Spore, a sleep-inducing move with an accuracy of 100.</description>

<description>Slakoth is a sloth-like Pokémon species found in the Hoenn region. Like what its name and anatomy suggest, Slakoth is extremely lazy, and its daily routine is extremely uneventful, and since it uses and requires so little energy, it sustains itself on three leaves a day and its heart beats once per minute. Slakoth is one of the most proficient sleepers in the Pokémon world, sleeping 20 hours a day (compare with Abra), and it is clearly not worried about possible predators in the area. Onlookers get sleepy themselves when looking at a Slakoth, in fact. Once in a great while, though, Slakoth can summon a surprising amount of energy and effort to travel great distances by swimming along rivers.</description>

Though extremely lazy, a Slaking`s body contains a great amount of pent-up energy, and if it must battle an opponent it can potentially exert devastating power. In fields where these Pokémon have been, large bare patches appear in the grass. This is from were it reaches out and pulls up and eats all of the grass in its vicinity. When it has all been eaten, it reluctantly moves to another spot.</description>

<description>Nincada is an insectoid species of Pokémon found in the Hoenn region. It burrows underground and lives for years by feeding on tree roots, hiding motionlessly under the soil. Using its whiskerlike antennae, it feels its way to tree roots, which it slices open with its claws to feed. As a burrower, it`s nearly blind until it evolves, and it doesn`t even like being exposed to light.
Much like the cicada, it metamorphoses into a flying adult form through Pokémon evolution called Ninjask, and it leaves a distinctive husk behind. Unlike the mundane cicada`s husk, however, Nincada`s husk itself becomes a separate, sentient Pokémon species known as Shedinja. This is the only instance in Pokémon media where an individual Pokémon`s evolutionary process results in the creation of two individual Pokémon, and in the Pokémon RPGs when a Pokémon trainer-owned Nincada evolves into a Ninjask, a Shedinja will appear in an empty slot in the trainer`s Pokémon inventory.</description>

<description>Ninjask is a bug-type Pokémon that is the larger and stronger evolved form of Nincada. This cicada-like species is extremely fast. It constantly darts around, moving so fast that it is difficult to detect it. However, its distinctive cry is all too well heard, which led people in the Pokémon world to consider Ninjask invisible in the past. Ninjask loves to feed on tree sap. Ninjask is a difficult Pokémon to train, not only because it is hard to keep track of its location but also due to its demanding personality. Ninjask needs a competent trainer, and if it finds itself in the hands of an inexperienced person it will refuse to obey and instead cry continuously.</description>

<description>Shedinja is a unique species of Pokémon that is quite literally the shed exoskeleton of a newly evolved Ninjask that has taken on a ghostly transformation of its own. Their hard-layered bodies are hollow and utterly dark, and they do not possess organs normally considered vital for life. There is a circular dark hole in its back which the Ninjask would theoretically climb out of after its evolution, and an old legend states that a Shedinja will steal the souls of anyone who looks into the opening on its back. Like shed exoskeletons, Shedinja are completely immobile and do not breathe.[3] They are able to float and hover, however, though its wings do not move. They also have a halo-like object above their heads, suggesting the iconography of death, as Shedinja is technically undead.
In the Pokémon games, due to its extremely frail nature, Shedinja only has one hit point no matter its level. To compensate, it has a unique ability known as Wonder Guard. Because of this ability, Shedinja can only be damaged by the five attack types which deal super-effective damage to it, namely, Fire, Flying, Rock, Ghost, and Dark type attacks. Weather effects such as hail or sandstorm will also harm Shedinja.
In Pokémon Sapphire, Ruby, or Emerald, Shedinja is not found in the wild, but can be unlocked if you leave an open space in your party and evolve Nincada. Shedinja will be located in the empty space.</description>

<description>Whismur is a basic species of Pokémon found in the Hoenn region. Whismur is a very timid Pokémon who dwells in caves. Its most defining characteristic is its voice. Normally, a Whismur makes very little noise, murmuring at a barely audible volume. However, if it senses danger, a Whismur starts crying in an incredibly loud voice that rivals the noise made by a jet plane. Whismur will then be startled by their own crying and cry harder, until they tire themselves out and fall asleep. Once Whismur starts crying, it will probably go on for some time even if the danger goes away, because it is startled by its own crying and cries louder still. It doesn`t even pause to catch its breath, since it breathes in through its ear canals (a technique reminiscent of circular breathing). Therefore, if its ear covers are shut, Whismur will stop crying. Otherwise, it will continue until it cries itself to sleep.</description>

<description>Loudred is a Pokémon species that is the larger and stronger form that the Whismur species takes when going through Pokémon evolution. A Loudred builds power by stamping the ground while shouting. After Loudred finishes shouting, it becomes incapable of hearing anything for a while, which is considered a weak point. Loudred`s bellowing can decimate a wood-frame house and its subsequent shockwaves can turn over a truck. It only needs to use its voice to punish its foes. Its round ears serve as loudspeakers, and they are positioned to assail foes with ultrasonic waves at massive volume. Loudred are also immune to Jigglypuff`s and Wigglytuff`s song.</description>

<description>Exploud is the final evolved form of the Whismur evolutionary line. This large, imposing purple creature has a body and vocal cords that are specifically constructed to emit noises and sounds of any decibel level, high or low. The holes seen all over its body actually serve a dual-purpose; They can violently inhale air, signifying that Exploud is about to let loose a huge bellow loud enough that it can be heard from over six miles away and strong enough to trigger earthquakes. Exploud employs this as its offensive measure against opponents in battle. The holes themselves can emit sounds as well. The sound-generating organs hidden at the base of each tubular hole can be adjusted by Exploud for tone and volume, and whenever Exploud lets loose a bellow, the noise is amplified by these organs. When communicating with other Pokémon such as other Exploud, it emits slighter whistle-like sounds from its sound tubes instead of its normal voice.</description>

Its daily routine is said to involve a lot of harsh training, much like the Pokémon Machop, and its training increases its power and durability. It is thought that Makuhita regularly train in the secluded environs of a cave, and people around these caves have often reported hearing rumbling tremors from within the caves. Its body training is noted to always be accompanied by ample food consumption and sleep, for it is the goal of a Makuhita to gain enough weight and body mass to evolve into its bigger, fatter form of Hariyama.</description>

Hariyama trains by stomping on the ground to build power, and it gains enough power so that its arm thrusts can snap telephone poles in two and send ten-ton trucks flying. Although it appears fat, its bulk is made up almost entirely of muscle. If Hariyama were to tighten these muscles, it would be as hard as a rock. It has been known to challenge people to contests of strength without any hesitation. It has even been observed to stand on train tracks and stop trains in their tracks using forearm thrusts as a display of its power.</description>

<description>Azurill, a species of Pokémon introduced shortly before the official start of the third generation of the Pokémon franchise as a "preview Pokémon", is the younger pre-evolved form of the Marill species introduced in the second generation. Its circular tail is large and rubbery, and Azurill`s playful nature causes it to often be seen bouncing and playing on its bouncy tail. The tail is vital both for survival in peacetime and self-defense in battle; It is packed full with nutrients that supply itself to Azurill`s body in order for it to grow. It is also a floatation device in water, much like the tails of its evolutions Marill and Azumarill. Its tail is about 1.3x as large as its body. Azurill`s most intriguing habit with its tail involves spinning its tail as if it were a lasso, then hurling it out with intense force. The momentum of the throw sends its body flying, too. Using this unique mode of travel, one individual Azurill was seen to hurl itself a record 33 feet.
In the Pokémon RPGs, Azurill can only be acquired by hatching an egg produced by Marill holding the Sea Incense item. In the Pokémon anime, trainer Misty owns one after her previous "baby" Pokémon, Togepi, evolved into Togetic and departed. This Azurill is the offspring of Tracey`s Marill. It is shown to have a sweet and caring nature and loves to play with the other Pokémon.</description>

<description>Nosepass is a Pokemon species found in the Hoenn region. Nosepass appears as a rocky-but-animate figurine vaguely in the shape of an Easter Island statue. It lives in caves and comes across as immobile because it is often found standing still in these environments. However, Nosepass displays behavior commonly associated with predatorial animals in the wild as well, hunting and feeding on prey that might be foolish enough to approach it. Its full body emits a powerful force of magnetism which it uses to pull its prey towards it like a tractor beam before feeding. This sense of magnetism is naturally bolstered in cold seasons.
The nose of Nosepass is undoubtedly its most notable feature. It is the focal point of Nosepass` magnetic nature, and this works to make Nosepass something of a living compass. When seen standing idly, it is consistently facing the North Pole as directed by its magnetic nose. Travelers who encounter this Pokemon can therefore actually use the placement of a Nosepass to check the direction of north and get their bearings. However, close observation has revealed that the Pokemon is affected by polar drift; With each passing year, Nosepass` direction shifts slightly at a rate of 3/8 of an inch each year. Since all Nosepass have noses of the same magnetism, if two of these Pokemon meet, they cannot turn their faces towards each other when they are close because their magnetic noses repel one another.
In the fourth generation of Pokemon media, if a Nosepass is brought to the Sinnoh region and it gains a level of experience while inside Mt. Coronet, it will evolve into Probopass.</description>

In the Pokémon anime, trainer May has a Skitty that she uses for Contests. It can juggle and perform a variety of attacks, for which it also is useful in battle, when it is not chasing its own tail. May`s Skitty (like Jessie`s Wobbuffet, Misty`s Psyduck and Brock`s Croagunk) has a knack for coming out of its Poké Ball at some inappropriate moments, which may make May`s opponent think it`s her next battle Pokémon.
In Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, Skitty is one of the sixteen available starter Pokémon.Skitty is also playable in the game`s sequel and is one of three normal types.(the others being Meowth and Munchlax)</description>

<description>Delcatty is a highly laid back, unconcerned species of Pokemon. It prefers to live completely free of priorities, doing only what it pleases at its own pace. Since these include eating and sleeping, its daily routine is completely random. However, its activities are generally more nocturnal than not. Delcatty does not stake a claim on a personal lair like other more territorial species of Pokemon. Rather, it makes it a habit to wander about and seek out more comfortable spots when it decides it`s time to sleep. Even here it is not defensive; if another Pokémon approaches its spot, Delcatty will take off for another place rather than fight. Domesticated Delcatty are highly regarded by fashion-trendy female trainers who often use the Pokemon in competitions revolving around its style and fur.</description>

It is a lithovore, meaning that its diet consists of rocks and minerals, which it uncovers from the ground using its sharp claws. When its body becomes saturated with substances derived from the rocks it eats, those substances crystallize and rise to the surface of its body, giving it a gem-studded appearance. Despite its hermetic lifestyle, Sableye is a cause of fear for many thanks to its eyes, which glitter eerily in the darkness of the caves it inhabits. In the Pokémon world, it is thought that a Sableye can steal a person`s spirit when its eyes shine that way. There is no attack type that is super effective on it, making it the first Pokémon without a weakness and the only such Pokémon until Spiritomb arrived in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.</description>

It usually lives in colonies very deep below the mountain, usually about a mile down. If iron ore becomes unavailable, the colony moves to another place to search for solid iron objects. This even includes steel bridges and rails, something which occasionally causes problems for humans. Because of this, Aron colonies are largely considered a pest to society.

<description>Swalot`s name is a contraction of swallow and a lot, referring to this Pokémon`s habit of eating and digesting things in large amounts. The Japanese name Marunoom comes from the Japanese words for wholly (丸ごと, marugoto) and swallow (呑む, nomu).</description>

<description>Carvanha`s name originates from the words "carve" and "piranha". Its Japanese name is a portmanteau of 牙 (kiba), fang, and the English word "piranha". Another possible origin is "carnivore" which means meat or flesh eater. Referring to its evolution, Sharpedo, the name Carcharias (a genus of sharks) is possibly an influence to carvanha`s name.</description>

<description>Wailord is a gigantic, oceanic mammal with the largest known size of all Pokémon. Living in the vast oceans of the Pokémon world, Wailord swims languorously in pods of about four members or more, often at the surface so it can breathe through its upper nostrils. With huge mouths these Pokémon can eat massive amounts of undersea food, such as krill, in a single gulp. When chasing somewhat larger prey, Wailord herd them by leaping out of the water and making humongous splashes in what is often described as a breathtaking display. If a Wailord inhales to the maximum capacity of its gigantic lungs, it is able to dive close to 10,000 feet below the surface. Optionally by puffing itself up, it can float high on the ocean surface or beach on a shoreline if it wishes.</description>

<description>Camerupt is the evolution of Numel. The volcano-shaped humps are formed by a transformation of Camerupt`s bones. Within Camerupt`s body is the violent activity of a volcano, containing molten magma of up to 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit that occasionally erupts from its volcanic mountain-shaped humps. This phenomenon happens naturally about once every ten years, but it most often occurs when Camerupt becomes enraged. Camerupt lives in the craters of volcanoes.</description>

<description>Torkoal exhales an always present cloud of smoke through its nostrils and through holes in its body and has a dark gray stone shell. It also consumes coal. Torkoal fills the hollows in its shell with coal and burns it - its strength is diminished without this supply. It will search through whole mountains to find it. If attacked, this Pokemon spouts thick black smoke in order to retreat. If this is not possible, this Pokémon needs more coal for energy. It lets off a sound that is similar to a locomotive`s horn when emitting smoke from its nostrils.
In the anime, Ash and friends help protect a Torkoal from the guardian of the place which consists of a Steelix. After saving it, Ash captures it. His Torkoal displays a large amount of affection for him and usually starts crying at random moments since it has low self esteem and usually does everything wrong, like diving into the ocean. Upon his return to Kanto to participate in the Battle Frontier, Ash left Torkoal and Glalie with Professor Oak.</description>

<description>Spoink leads a bizarre, fragile existence. It moves around by bouncing on its tail. However, Spoink`s bouncing has an additional, far more vital role. The small shock generated by Spoink`s impact with the ground every time it bounces courses through its body and causes its heart to pump. Essentially, Spoink`s heart is jumpstarted every time it beats. If Spoink ever stopped bouncing, its heart would stop and it would die. Thus, Spoink constantly bounces up and down, even while sleeping.
Spoink exhibits its psychic powers best by focusing them through an object, which also serves to amplify them. This object is the pearl that a Clamperl makes once in its lifetime. The pearl size is also the amount of power the Spoink has. That is why it`s always looking for bigger pearls, it wants more power! The anime suggests that prolonged separation of Spoink from its pearl will weaken Spoink greatly, even risking death.
Spoink resembles a pig.</description>

<description>Flygon has its natural habitat in the desert, across which it flies. Flygon`s wings kick up a cloud of dust and sand each time they flap, so that whenever Flygon moves, it is surrounded by a constant sandstorm. This provides Flygon with a useful cover from enemies and other unwanted visitors who lose themselves in the dust cloud, while Flygon itself maintains perfect vision thanks to red covers that shield its eyes from the storm. But it is at a disadvantage in the jungle because the trees are so close together they cover almost the entire floor of the jungle from a bird`s-eye view. This Pokémon is known as "The Desert Spirit." When inside a Flygon-created sandstorm, the only thing one is aware of is the melodious sound of Flygon`s wings, which can resemble the notes of a song. Because of this, and the Pokédex related cry, it is thought that perhaps Flygon has the ability to buzz its wings at a rapid pace to create a melody.</description>

<description>Cacnea prefers to live in harsh, arid locations, such as deserts. Cacnea live in or right next to bushes that are in the desert. The more arid and harsh the environment, the more pretty and fragrant type of flower a Cacnea can grow. It can survive for 30 days on water stored in its body. Cacnea releases a strong aroma from its flower to attract prey. When prey comes near, Cacnea shoots sharp thorns from its body to bring the victim down. This Pokémon battles by wildly swinging its thorny arms.
In the anime, the most notable Cacnea is James`s. He obtained it in the very episode in which his Weezing, along with Jessie`s Arbok, was released. Cacnea is rather fond of James . However, when it attempts to express his fondness of James through hugging him, his numerous spikes injure James. Cacnea is the replacement in his party, for his former grass type Pokémon, Victreebel. Jessie sometimes uses Cacnea in Pokémon Contests, but often falls victim to its spikes, ala James. James`s Cacnea was recently given to Gardenia, who felt Cacnea wasn`t living up to its full potential.</description>

<description>Cacturne is a Pokémon of low metabolism that spends the day standing completely still, so that it will not lose any moisture from the scorching sun of the desert. At night, in low temperatures, Cacturne will group together and slowly follow any humans that are walking through the desert. When the fatigued human finally stops walking, the Cacturne will attack, absorbing moisture and fluids from the prey`s body. After living in the desert for several millennia, new generations of Cacturne have had their blood transformed into the same substances as sand. Cacturne are naturally immune to sandstorms, and will not be damaged by the Sandstorm attack.
In the anime, May`s rival Harley, who dresses like a Cacturne, has a Cacturne as his signature Pokémon, skilled at creatively using attacks like Cotton Spore, Bullet Seed and Pin Missile to both terrify and impress the audience and judges in Contests. When Harley once met with Team Rocket, his Cacturne was instantly attracted to Jessie and hugged her, accidentally sticking her with its spines.</description>

The characteristic a Zangoose is most famous for is its relationship with Seviper. Simply put, the two species are mortal enemies. The hatred a Zangoose holds for a Seviper is deep and goes so far back that it is practically instinctive.
The Zangoose is a big, white, catlike creature with huge claws - purple or black, depending on the artist - and tufts of hair pointing back from the head instead of ears. It is, as said before, a milk white - except for the red markings on its fur.</description>

Lunatone was first discovered forty years ago in Meteor Falls, a cave in Hoenn, its only known habitat. Meteor Falls, as its name suggests, is full of meteorites and the craters left by them as they impacted the planet`s surface, suggesting that Lunatone (and Solrock) as partners, have their origins in outer space. Lunatone is greatly connected to the moon, and its vitality ebbs and flows depending on the lunar cycle. Lunatone`s power and activity is greatest during the full moon, and weakest during the day and when the moon is new. Anyone who looks at its glowing red eyes becomes transfixed with fear.</description>

Solrock, apparently a meteorite whose origins appear to be from outer space, is expressionless, yet is somewhat sentient. It was discovered along with Lunatone in Meteor Falls, a site where a rain of meteorites impacted the ground. The Pokemon`s solar connections are apparent in battle: It absorbs solar power during the day and unleashes the sunlight as a concentrated beam of energy as its main weapon (compare with Venusaur). Since it also carries Psychic powers, Solrock can also sense what the foe is thinking. Solrock and Lunatone are counterparts. Lunatone represents the moon and Solrock represents the sun.</description>

<description>Barboach lives in muddy areas of riverbeds. It probes this mud with its whiskers before deciding where to bury itself underneath the level of the mud, so that it remains motionless while its top whiskers are poking above the surface. The whiskers act as a superb radar system in this position, for Barboach detects its prey in the area using its whiskers to sense disturbances in the air.
Barboach`s body is covered with a slimy film, which is an important measure of discouraging both bacteria and predators from targeting Barboach. Whenever Barboach is partially submerged in mud, the film functions as a barrier to prevent germs in the mud from entering Barboach`s otherwise thin, unprotected body. Also, if a predator attempts to grab it, the Pokemon effortlessly slips out of its grasp as if it were a bar of wet, flexible soap like the real world Hagfish. It would seem that Barboach`s body depends on keeping its slimy coating layer thick and fluid with the influence of muddy water because the Pokemon`s body weakens if the coating dries up.</description>

<description>Whiscash is a whale-like Pokémon. It has a dark-blue body, large round eyes, and thick light-blue lips, which usually form a smile. Attached on both cheeks are two long, yellow whiskers, which is why the Pokédex describes them as "Whiskers Pokémon". In its shiny version, Whiscash` belly and whiskers have turned dark red, and its body black.
Despite its amusing appearance, Whiscash is an extremely violent and territorial Pokémon. It makes its nest at the bottom of ponds or swamps, where it sleeps throughout the day. At night, it awakes, after which it will eat continually. Whiscash will easily claim a large pond or swamp as its exclusive territory. If an intruder approaches it, Whiscash will thrash about, triggering massive earthquakes with a radius of over three miles. Whiscash also has the ability to predict real earthquakes.
Whishcash, Namazun in the Japanese games, is clearly based upon the Namazu ("catfish") in Japanese mythology. The creature lives in the mud beneath the earth, and is guarded by the god Kashima, who restrains the creature with a stone. If Kashima lets his guard fall however, Namazu will be set loose and cause earthquakes.
Whiscash has a mark similar to a "W" on its head. Since its Japanese name does not contain a "W", many believe it stands for "Widiot", which matches its vacant expression.</description>

Corphish is a hardy and durable Pokémon; it can thrive almost under any condition. It can make its nest even in polluted water, and it will make a meal out of anything available, taking the term omnivore to extremes.
In the Pokémon anime, Corphish is one of the Pokémon that Ash has in his traveling team for the duration of Hoenn and the entire Battle Frontier challenge in Kanto. Corphish is friendly, but does not realize its own strength; it often ends up flinging Ash away while expressing its affection to him. Corphish is also short-tempered, and often tries to instigate a fight when peaceful solutions exist, and also gets jealous when one of Ash`s Pokémon evolve, since it wants Ash`s attention.</description>

Cradily is an aquatic creature that makes its nest in the shallows of warm seas. For this reason, when the tide goes out, Cradily can be seen on what are now wet beaches. In a particularly turbulent area of the sea shore, Cradily anchors itself to the sea floor with its heavy, particularly shaped lower body so as to prevent itself from being washed out to sea.
When hunting marine creatures, Cradily makes its way deeper into the ocean, dragging its heavy body along as its body`s anchor-like composition prevents Cradily from floating off the sea floor and to the surface. When Cradily spots its prey, it extends its trunk-like neck and its eight tentacles to ensnare its target, where it uses powerful acid secreted in its tentacles to melt the prey before feeding.</description>

Those that see it are said to forget their combative spirits right away; in particularly strong cases of anger, however, a Milotic`s body can glow a vivid pink and release a pulsing wave of energy that brings soothing calm to the restless spirits of the people and Pokémon involved.
The evolution of Feebas into Milotic is unique within the Pokemon video games, in that a Feebas will only evolve into Milotic when its Beauty condition is sufficiently high.</description>

<description>Castform is a small, rather unique Pokémon that resembles a cloud. It might be used like a satellite dish to sense upcoming weather changes.
It is distinct from other Pokémon in that its water-like cellular structure is affected by the weather, to the extent that its type and appearance change in extreme conditions. In intense sunlight, Castform becomes a Fire-type Pokémon that resembles an orange, stylized sun sitting atop a white cloud; in the rain, it becomes a Water-type and looks like a water drop sitting on a gray cloud; and in hail, it turns purple and is encased in a green, tornado-shaped cloud. In all other weather conditions, Castform retains its original typing and appearance. Castform`s mood is also influenced by the weather.
Like Porygon and Mewtwo, Castform is one of few human-made "artificial" Pokémon. It was created by the researchers of the Weather Institute in the Hoenn region as an experiment in weather forecast and manipulation. Its man-made nature is reflected in its uniform stats, all of which have a really average value.
It is the only Pokémon with the Forecast ability and one of two that learns the move Weather Ball (the other Pokémon capable of learning Weather Ball is Roserade via Move Tutor in Pastoria City). Both are influenced by the weather, regardless of how it`s set up (Castform does not personally need to change the weather for it to be affected).
Castform can naturally learn three weather moves which changes the typing of Castform and Weather Ball: Sunny Day (Fire), Rain Dance (Water), and Hail (Ice). It will become the type of the move, (having the same weaknesses and resistances), and Weather Ball will do that type of damage. It can also learn, by using a TM, Sandstorm. While Castform will not transform into a Rock-type during a Sandstorm, Weather Ball will do Rock-type damage. In Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, if Shadow Sky is used, Castform doesn`t change, but its Weather Ball damage is identical to Shadow Pokémon moves having no weakness or resistance. In all extreme weather, Weather Ball`s power is doubled.
Weather Ball also becomes even more powerful in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl because of the new attack changes. It is now a Special move regardless of its typing, so it depends on the Special Attack rating rather than the Attack rating (which was originally used for Normal- and Rock-type moves).</description>

<description>Kecleon possesses the ability to change its body coloration at will in order to blend with its surroundings, approaching invisibility. Kecleon puts this stealthy trait to good use when hunting, as it can sneak up on its prey undetected and trap it with its long and stretchy tongue. Kecleon does not have absolute control of its appearance, however: it can never change the color of the zigzag band in the middle of its body, which renders his cloaking useless to any fairly keen observer. Secondly, a Kecleon can involuntarily shift colors based on its emotions, so that a sudden mood swing will change its looks completely. Finally, a Kecleon will revert to its original colors if it is startled. In the video games, Kecleon`s unique Color Change ability changes its type to match that of the last damage-dealing attack that hit it.</description>

<description>Shuppet are nocturnal entities that feed on feelings of envy, vengeance, malice, and other negative emotions. They are able to capture negative feelings in the atmosphere by channeling them into its horn. The captured energy is used by Shuppet as sustenance, allowing it to grow. At the same time, the projected person feels much better as his negative emotions leave him. These Pokemon are therefore attracted to people who hold negative emotions, and are known to roam cities in the night in search of such grudges. If someone develops especially strong feelings of vengeance, Shuppet can group in a swarm to line up beneath the eaves of that person`s home.</description>

<description>Banette are said to come from plush toys that were thrown away, similar to how Grimer and Koffing are formed by industrial waste. Shuppet possesses a discarded doll, growing into and forming Banette. It is also said that Banette live in garbage dumps or back alleys and wander around looking for the children that disposed of them. Each Banette is filled with strong feelings of hate, which it expresses by laying powerful curses. It gains power to cast those curses by sticking pins into its own body, turning itself into a voodoo doll. Banette`s weakness lies in that its vital force is artificial, since it is an inanimate object infused with a cursed energy. This energy can be removed and effectively exorcized by forcing its zipper-like mouth open.</description>

It is theorized that Tropius`s love of fruit eventually resulted in the species incorporating fruit as part of its very anatomy. It may also be that Tropius eats so much fruit that it gets an excess of vitamins and minerals, so it grows fruit to get rid of excess nutrients. Bunches of banana-like fruit can be seen growing under a Tropius`s neck. These fruit are deliciously sweet and particularly popular among the children in south tropical villages, who eat it as snacks. Tropius also has broad leaves on its back, which, if flapped hard enough, can be used as wings, enabling this bulky Pokémon to fly.</description>

<description>Chimecho is known as the "Wind Chime Pokémon." Chimecho`s light frame and its psychic powers enable it to freely fly around, especially during the hot season. If a Chimecho wishes to remain in one place for a while, it employs its suction cup to affix itself on trees or the eaves of a building. Chimecho has the distinctive ability to produce a ringing cry, the volume of which is amplified inside its hollow head and comes out as a chiming sound. A Chimecho can produce seven different tones to communicate various messages to its kindred. If threatened, Chimecho can use its cries as a defensive weapon, turning them into ultrasonic waves that knock its foes back.
Although Chimecho did not officially exist at that time, a figure of it appears in the TV episode "The Ghost of Maiden`s Peak" on one of the small lantern ships (18:30-18:35 in the US version).</description>

<description>Snorunt live in icy dark caves and enjoys crying out to hear its own echo. Its diet consists solely of snow and ice. Old folklore claims that a house visited by Snorunt is sure to prosper for many generations to come. It generally moves in groups of five Snorunt, and they hide away during the hot seasons of Summer and Spring. Being an Ice-type, Snorunt can withstand temperatures of up to negative 150 degrees. Also, it has the peculiar ability to make Winter come early. A Snorunt typically evolves into a Glalie at level 42, but if a Snorunt is female and a player uses a Dawn Stone on it, it will evolve into a Froslass.
In the Pokémon anime, Snorunt is Ash Ketchum`s fifth Pokémon from the Hoenn region. It has a powerful Ice Beam, though this is hindered by Snorunt`s bad aim. Because of this, Ash constantly trains it to try and improve its use of the technique. Snorunt eventually evolves into Glalie while fighting Team Rocket.</description>

<description>Spheal is a spherical creature that rolls across ice floes because its body isn`t cut out for swimming. Spheal, in spite of its infancy, is fully capable of living in Arctic environments such as a tundra. Though it is not obvious, its body is fully covered in a layer of plushy fur that feels fluffy to the touch. This is surprisingly good at insulating Spheal against the cold when it is rolling about on ice floes or diving into the sea, for it apparently never feels the cold at all. When groups of Spheal eat, they instinctively show their pleasure by clapping and making other noises.</description>

<description>Sealeo lives in herds among the ice floes of Arctic regions, and these herds consist of both itself and its other evolutionary forms Spheal and Walrein. Its flippers are quite powerful: they are strong enough to shatter ice with well-placed flaps. Five times a day, Sealeo dives into the sea to hunt prey.
Sealeo`s behavior revolves mostly around its sensitive nose; Sealeo uses it to investigate new things. It lifts new objects up with its nose, and rolls them around. While rolling an object, Sealeo checks the object`s aroma and texture in order to learn about it. This is what it does to differentiate food from anything else, making it a vital ability for survival. However, Sealeo also takes a liking to balancing and spinning a younger Spheal on its nose for entertainment.</description>

The Walrein are the dominant members of their society, protecting their groups from attackers with their large strong tusks. These tusks are strong enough to thoroughly shatter blocks of ice weighing ten tons. When alone in the Arctic seas, Walrein`s thick blubber insulates it from the extreme cold of sub-zero temperature water, and it uses its tusks to clear its way as it swims through ice floes. The blubber is also resilient enough to make enemy attacks such as bites bounce off relatively harmlessly.</description>

<description>Clamperl is protected by a sturdy shell. Once in a lifetime, it makes a magnificent pearl.

Clamperl grows while being protected by its rock-hard shell. When its body becomes too large to fit inside the shell, it is sure evidence that it is getting close to evolution. However its shell is not only good for protection - it is also used for clamping and catching prey. A fully grown Clamperl`s shell will be scored with nicks and scratches all over.
Clamperl first appeared in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, and can evolve into two different forms through trading via the Game Boy Advance`s Game Link Cable, depending on which of two different items it is holding-Gorebyss with the Deepseascale, or Huntail with the Deepseatooth. Both of these items are given to the player by Captain Stern after he is rescued.</description>

It lights up the eye-like textures on its tail and wiggles it to deceive prey into thinking they have found a fish to eat. Then Huntail attacks and attempts to swallow the prey whole with its gaping mouth. It prefers smaller prey since its body and stomach are rather thin.</description>

<description>Salamence is very happy at its successful acquisition of wings, yearning for them since being a Bagon, and expresses its feelings by soaring all over the sky, blowing fire from its mouth. Salamence is just as easily expressive when enraged: when angry, it loses all thought and destroys everything around it with its fire breath and shredding claws. Salamence is a very strong Pokémon because of its incredible attack and special attack, and therefore highly desirable to trainers. However, Bagon and Shelgon, its two pre-evolved forms are difficult to train and level up.
Salamence (and its pre-evolved form Shelgon) cannot be found in the wild, so Salamence must be evolved from a Bagon which can be found in Hoenn`s Meteor Falls. However, Salamence was obtainable at a Nintendo promotional event in which it was given out to players with the rare move Wish.</description>

It can also use psychic abilities, including the ability to render its massive body airborne by telekinesis once it draws its legs together.
This Pokémon lives in mountainous areas. It can easily live comfortably on very steep slopes by planting its legs into rock or ground. Metagross is also a brutal predator. When hunting, it pins its prey to the ground under its massive body. It then eats the helpless victim using its large mouth on its underside.</description>

<description>Latias is the female Eon Pokémon from the Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald series of games and is one of a duo of Psychic/Dragon-type Pokémon, the other being Latios. These two are the only legendary Pokémon in the games that have genders (other than Heatran and Cresselia, which first appear in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.)
Latias is a red-and-white dragon Pokémon with small arms and feet, and spiky wings on her back. She has triangle-shaped blue markings on her belly that are similar to those of a Togepi. She is able to use a form of active camouflage by enfolding her body with her glass-like coat of down and refracting light in unique ways, allowing her to become invisible or even take on the appearance of a human.
Latias is highly sensitive to the emotions of people and can telepathically communicate with them. She rarely makes contact with people or other Pokémon. If Latias senses any hostility, she ruffles the feathers all over her body and cries shrilly to intimidate her foe. Like Latios, Latias is highly intelligent. Latias has been occasionally sighted in small herds of several members, although she is unable to breed in the video games.
Latias`s only anime appearance was in the fifth Pokémon anime film, Pokémon Heroes. Latias also appears in the non-Pokémon-exclusive video game Super Smash Bros. Brawl appearing in tandem with Latios as Pokémon appearing from Poké Ball items.
Latias can be found in Pokémon Sapphire after completing the Pokémon League. She is found on a random-encounter basis, similar to that of Raikou, Entei, and Suicune in Gold, Silver, and Crystal. She can also be found in Emerald after completing the Pokémon League, but in Emerald, the player`s mother tells him or her to watch a TV news story, which explains that a Pokémon (its name cannot be heard) has been seen. This gives the player a choice of capturing either Latias or Latios. Latias can also be obtained via the Eon Ticket, given to the player after attending a Nintendo promotional event for Pokémon Ruby.</description>

<description>Latios is the male Eon Pokémon. They are a blue and white, dragon-like, legendary Pokémon with small arms and feet, and spiky fighter aircraft-like wings on their back. They appear to have white flesh underneath their blue carapace. They appear extremely similar to Latias, only blue, and more angular. It is said that by folding their arms close to their body, they can fly faster than a jet. Latios are all male.
Latios` intelligence allows them to understand human languages. They have a docile temperament and dislike fighting. A Latios will only open his heart to a trainer with a compassionate spirit. Their signature attack, Luster Purge, may reduce the target`s special defense. Like Latias, Latios can also render themselves invisible.
Latios, along with Latias, have a starring role in the movie Pokémon Heroes as guardians of Altomare, a city modeled after Venice, Italy. At the end of the film, Latios sacrifices himself to protect Altomare from a tremendous tsunami. It is notable that Latios marks the first actual Pokémon death in the anime series so far (the imaginary Entei and Celebi do not count). This may have been the fact that Latios is based on Jesus in characteristics.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kyogre is one of a trio of legendary Pokémon, alongside Groudon and Rayquaza. Kyogre represents Pokémon Sapphire and appears on the cover art for the game. Kyogre represents the primal force of the oceans; as such, it has the power to bring forth storms, constant rain and massive floods. It is part of the creation myth of the Pokémon world. According to legend, a titanic battle between it and Groudon created the oceans and the land, and the two were sealed beneath their respective elements. Despite being the creator of the oceans, Kyogre still came and helped Manaphy when it needed help as any other regular Pokémon would. Kyogre is similar to an orca or killer whale. It is a Water-type with the ability Drizzle, which makes the weather rainy until another weather move is used or a Pokémon with another weather altering ability is switched in.
In Pokémon Sapphire, Team Aqua tries to awaken and control Kyogre. It is awakened by a blue orb that the group actively seeks. They eventually awaken Kyogre, but they are stopped by the player in the video games. Kyogre made its first movie appearance in the ninth Pokémon movie, Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea. In the movie, Kyogre helps Ash, May, Pikachu, and Manaphy to protect the Sea Temple and defeat The Phantom.</description>

<description>Groudon is one of a trio of legendary Pokémon, alongside Kyogre and Rayquaza, that represents Pokémon Ruby and appears on its cover art. In the legend surrounding the three, Groudon represents the land, while Kyogre and Rayquaza represent the sea and the sky, respectively. Groudon, representing land, raised lands and expanded continents in legend. Coming as a savior for humans suffering from floods caused by Kyogre, it can dissipate clouds, and evaporate water with light and heat. After a titanic battle with Kyogre, it went to sleep in underground magma, causing volcanoes to erupt when it awakes. It is a Ground-type with the Drought ability, which makes the weather sunny until another weather move is used or a Pokémon with another weather-altering ability is switched in.
Groudon first appears in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire and Pokémon Emerald along with Kyogre and Rayquaza. Pokémon Ruby focuses on Team Magma awakening Groudon to take over the world, while Pokémon Emerald has both Groudon and Kyogre awake. The anime follows a similar structure, where both Pokémon are awakened, and forced to battle by Team Magma and Team Aqua. This is foiled by Ash Ketchum and Lance, and Groudon and Kyogre return to their respective elements after calling a truce. Groudon also plays a pseudo-role in the sixth Pokémon movie, Jirachi Wishmaker, where an evil being in the form of a Groudon is formed from the energy of Jirachi.</description>

<description>Rayquaza is one of a trio of legendary Pokémon, alongside Kyogre and Groudon, that represents Pokémon Emerald and appears on its cover art. In the legend surrounding the three, Rayquaza represents the sky, while Kyogre and Groudon represent the sea and the land, respectively. Rayquaza resides within the ozone layer of the Earth and has lived there for hundreds of millions of years without ever descending. To those who have observed Rayquaza from the surface of the planet, Rayquaza has always appeared to be a zooming meteor. Rayquaza feeds on water and particles in the Earth`s atmosphere. It is said to only descend from the ozone layer if Kyogre and Groudon were to fight, in order to end the feud and maintain the balance of nature.
In Pokémon Emerald, Rayquaza is seen in a series of cutscenes. Once the player progresses past the Magma and Aqua Hideouts, Kyogre and Groudon wake up and start fighting, with the Red and Blue Orbs unable to control them. It is eventually sought out at the Sky Pillar, and eventually forces the two to cease their battle. Rayquaza appears as a boss character in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games, where the main team has to fight it in order to have it annihilate a falling star hurtling towards the planet.
Rayquaza is featured in the seventh Pokémon movie, Destiny Deoxys. Four years prior to the main events of the movie, Rayquaza is nearly injured in the ozone layer by the passage of a meteor containing the essence of Deoxys. Rayquaza seemingly destroys the Deoxys afterwards, but it is eventually revived. Rayquaza goes after it again, but after being rescued by it, Rayquaza decides that it isn`t an enemy, and returns to the atmosphere.</description>

<description>Jirachi a legendary Pokémon that first appeared in the Nintendo games Pokémon Ruby and Pokémon Sapphire. It possesses telepathic and telekinetic abilities, including the ability to levitate. Jirachi hibernates for periods of one thousand years in a crystalline cocoon. If it is ever in danger, it will fight its attacker, but not awaken from its slumber. After one thousand years have elapsed, Jirachi awakens from its sleep for one week if it is sung to in a pure voice. During this period, it is able to make wishes. If a message is inscribed onto one of the "tags" on Jirachi`s head, it will fulfill those wishes. After it fulfills the wishes, Jirachi returns to hibernation in a newly-formed cocoon, waiting another thousand years for its next master`s wish.
Jirachi is one of the primary characters of the 6th Pokémon Movie, Jirachi Wishmaker. Tomiko Suzuki, in her final role, portrayed the character in the original Japanese version. Jirachi awakens for seven days, awaiting a wish to be granted. It soon befriends Max, and travels with him until it is used to create an evil being in the form of a Groudon. It absorbs the power used to create the beast, and returns to sleep.
While Jirachi was still in its slumber, it reached out to Max. Max became fast friends with Jirachi after it awakened, and helped it break free from Butler`s machine, which was used so that Butler could awaken Groudon with the use of the Jirachi`s powers. Jirachi awakens only once every thousand years, and Max was really sad when it went back to its slumber.</description>

<description>Deoxys (pronounced /di`ɑks.ɪs/) is a Pokémon formed from a mutation of a extraterrestrial virus exposed to a laser beam. It has psychokinetic powers and a high intelligence along with a crystalline organ on its chest that acts as its brain and shoots lasers. It has the ability to transform into four different forms, each with a specific purpose: Normal, Attack, Defense, and Speed. In the third generation of games, the form is based upon the game the Deoxys is contained within. As of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, it can freely change by interacting with the four meteorites in Veilstone City.
Deoxys` name is based on "Deoxyribonucleic acid", or DNA, which is the base of all life and contains instructions for every part of it.
Deoxys first appeared in the seventh Pokémon film, http://anidb.net/a2371 [Pokémon: Destiny Deoxys]. In the film, it demonstrated the ability to switch between its forms, create shadow copies for use as drones, regenerate missing body parts, launch an aurora into the sky, and erect a city-size force field which keeps nearly every sort of machine within from operating. The film also demonstrated that Deoxys is not a one-of-a-kind unique species like Rayquaza; more than one Deoxys is seen.
In early 2005, NASA began a cross-promotion with Nintendo and the Pokémon Company to provide an "edutainment" program for children across the United States by Internet, teaching the science behind various Pokémon characters as they appear in Trading Card Game expansions. In the first segment of the program, based on the newly-released EX: Deoxys Trading Card Game expansion, they used the character of Deoxys to teach children about outer space, anatomy of a virus, the meaning of DNA, the existence of the ozone layer, and a definition of an extraterrestrial. Since then the program has had two other segments covering the next two expansions: EX Emerald and EX Unseen Forces.

<description>Turtwig are small, turtle-like Pokémon, and are one of the three starter Pokémon for the Sinnoh region. Its prominent jawbone may denote a relationship to the snapping turtle. Its green and yellow body is covered by a shell. A small seedling grows on its head, similar to the plant bulb on Bulbasaur`s back and the leaf on Chikorita`s head.
The soil-based shell on its back grows stronger when it absorbs water. Turtwig survives by carrying out photosynthesis with its whole body. The leaf on its head will wilt if it becomes thirsty. As a result, it lives in areas that are close to lakes.
Turtwig makes its first Pokémon anime appearance in the first episode of the Diamond and Pearl series, "Following a Maiden Voyage!", where it is shown as one of the three Sinnoh starter Pokémon in Professor Rowan`s lab. Ash catches a wild Turtwig in the episode: "Gettin` Twiggy With It," and Turtwig also makes an appearance in "The Grass-Type is Always Greener!" as one of the Pokémon used by Eterna City`s Gym Leader Gardenia.</description>

Its shell is also strengthened by soil. Very slow and gentle, they only battle when needed, and in battle they will fight valiantly for the trainer. Also in DP100 Ash`s Turtwig will evolve into a Grotle.</description>

<description>Torterra is the final evolution of the Turtwig evolutionary line. Despite their great size, these Pokémon are peaceful in nature and enjoy being with others of their own kind, preferring to bask in sunlight as they do not like to fight. When immobile, they look as if they are part of the ground upon which they rest, not as though they were a sleeping Pokémon. Because of this appearance, there are occasions when small Pokémon will gather and build nests on the shell of a stationary Torterra. When Torterra do move, they often move in herds in search of water. Paul`s, (Ash`s Sinnoh rival`s), original starter Pokémon was a Turtwig that evolved into a Torterra.</description>

<description>Chimchar is a small chimpanzee-based primate with orange fur. It is the Fire-type starter for the Sinnoh reigon. The flames on their rears are produced by burning gas in their stomachs. Chimchar also has a swirl-like symbol on the chest. The flames do not go out in the rain, and, unlike the tail flames of Charmander, those of Chimchar go out when they go to sleep.
Chimchar makes its first Pokémon anime appearance in the first episode of the Diamond and Pearl series, "Following a Maiden Voyage!", where it is shown as one of the three Sinnoh starter Pokémon in Professor Rowan`s lab. Paul, one of the rivals of Ash in the series, has a Chimchar he found in the wild. Paul later abandons Chimchar after a poor showing in a battle, and Ash asks it if it wants to join his team. Chimchar accepts.</description>

A Piplup owned by a beginner Pokémon coordinator, Dawn, has appeared in all of the 4th generation episodes, to date. Dawn befriended Piplup after saving it from a group of Ariados, and chose it as her starter Pokémon. Piplup`s next stages, "Prinplup" and "Empoleon" are even more proud, bringing up the words prince and emperor in parts of their names.</description>

Staravia resembles a White-cheeked Starling. Its most prominent feature is the curled crest on its head, similar to that of a lapwing. It has a black and orange colored beak like a quail. The name Staravia derives from the English words starling and avian. Staravia`s Japanese name, Mukubird, is a portmanteau of the Japanese word for White-cheeked Starling (椋鳥, mukudori) and the English word bird.
In the anime, Ash`s Starly evolved into Staravia, and is frequently used in battles with Ash.</description>

Kricketot`s name originates from the words cricket, spelled with a "K," and tune, as in a musical tune.
Its appearance resembles a violin, or double bass, with string-like lines on its neck. Due to these traits, its design could have been influenced by the real life violin beetle. But with its scythes, or bows (for a violin), it could most likely be instrument-designed, like its pre-evolution, Kricketot.

However, when the two "vines" that are on top of Budew`s head open up, a big spot can be seen on each vine (one that is blue and the other being red). As a matter of fact, the two vines are actually what will be the Pokémon`s flower-holding arms when it evolves into Roselia. Budew also appears to be wearing a green bib.

<description>Burmy is a Bagworm Pokémon that can take on three forms by making cloaks out of different materials depending on where it battles. In grassy areas, it creates a cloak of twigs and leaves that also protects it from cold winds. In caves, it makes a cloak out of sand and dirt. In buildings, it uses trash and other materials to make its cloak. If the cloak is broken in battle, it makes a new one quickly. Upon evolution, if female, a Burmy will evolve into Wormadam, which also takes on a form similar to the cloak the Burmy was wearing, while male Burmy evolve into Mothim.</description>

<description>Wormadam is the evolved form of female Burmy. Wormadam is a unique Pokémon due to its multiple forms, which have different colors and different stats, as well as different secondary types. Wormadam`s form is dependent upon the form of the Burmy from which it evolved, as the materials on it become part of Wormadam`s body. If a Burmy evolves while battling inside a forest or in a grassy area it will evolve into the grass type Wormadam. If a Burmy evolves while battling inside a cave or on a mountainous region it will evolve into the ground type Wormadam. If a Burmy evolves while battling inside a building it will evolve into the steel type Wormadam.</description>

<description>Vespiquen is a single ruler of a colony of Combee, and is known as "The Queen of Insects". Its abdomen acts as a six-celled honeycomb for Combee grubs. They feed on honey collected by other Combee, and protect the Vespiquen if its in danger. The jewel that is located on the head of every Vespiquen is used in battle to collect rays of light that can be reflected and fired at any enemy at will. Vespiquen can also learn three powerful order attacks (Attack Order, Heal Order, and Defense Order) which it uses to call its fellow Combee for help on defending itself, healing itself, or attacking an enemy. Vespiquen is always female, as such only female Combees can evolve into it.</description>

When it dives, its sac deflates and it uses its forked tail to swim by rotating it like a screw. Males have two spots on their back, while females only have one.
In the anime, Dawn captures a renegade Buizel in the episode "Buizel Your Way Out of This." She later trades him to Ash for his Aipom. Later on in the the series Buizel is involved in an epic battle with a Lucario between Ash and Maylene at the Veilstone Gym and also learns the attack move Water Pulse.</description>

During normal weather conditions, it appears as two crossing purple petals with a short purple stem, a green leafy sepal covering, and two deep pink feet. Similar to Castform and unlike Cherubi, however, Cherrim`s appearance changes to the cherry blossom form during sunny conditions. Though the bud form is quite docile, the flower form is much more cheerful.
In Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, its Flower Gift ability strengthens it and another Pokémon when it is sunny. Cherrim learns the existing attack Sunny Day to make the weather sunny, as well as a new attack called Lucky Chant, which prevents critical hits. Cherrim can also learn a new attack, Worry Seed, which temporarily changes the target`s ability to Insomnia.</description>

It appears with two tails, which have fingers tipped in red, and two long hairs at the top of its head. These hairs are longer on the female than the male. Ambipom`s feet - which were the same color as its stomach when an Aipom - are now purple. Its arms are stated to be used significantly less than if it were still an Aipom; the two tails perform the arms` duties with better efficiency.
It is used by the gym leader Volkner, although it is not an electric type pokemon. Dawn also owns an Ambipom, which she evolved after she traded her Buizel for Ash`s Aipom.</description>

These Pokémon are surprisingly quick for being so robust. As to confirm a Glameow`s transition from slender to fat during evolution, a Glameow with the Limber ability will exchange it for the Thick Fat ability during evolution. A Purugly can also have the Own Tempo ability, which prevents confusion.</description>

<description>Bonsly is a small pot-like creature resembling a bonsai tree. The creature was introduced in 2004 in an issue of Coro Coro Magazine. Bonsly makes its proper and most playable debut in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, the game it was first advertised as being involved in.
Despite its tree-like appearance, Bonsly is actually made of rock. Bonsly often shed tears, though it has been found out that those are "fake tears", and that it is adjusting its body fluid level (appropriately enough, it can learn the move Fake Tears, which sharply decreases its target`s Special Defense) Wild Bonsly exist only in the Pearl Version, and upon learning how to Mimic, they evolve into the familiar Sudowoodo.
Its first anime appearance is in the eighth Pokémon movie, Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. However, its name is mispronounced in that movie; Bonsly is to be pronounced similarly to "bonsai", half of its namesake, the other being sly, for shedding "crocodile tears" Bonsly also appears in the "From Cradle to Save" episode, where Brock obtains it. Brock`s Bonsly eventually evolved into Sudowoodo.
Although regarded as a 4th generation Pokémon, it was included in the 2005 game Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, where the player must rescue one from the wreckage of S.S. Libra and reunite it with its trainer, a small girl. It also appears as a statue in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon as a reward.</description>

It has an affinity to mimicking the movements and emotions of the people and Pokémon around it. When it finally learns the move Mimic, it can evolve into Mr. Mime. Mime Jr. makes a cameo appearance as a collectable statue in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon before its true appearance in Pokémon Diamond, where wild ones can be caught.
The creature`s first anime appearance is in the eighth Pokémon movie, Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew, where it is owned by Lady Ilene, the queen of Cameron Palace. Mime Jr. appears in the second episode of Pokémon: Battle Frontier; "Sweet Baby James", where it belongs to James` Nanny and Pop-pop; the caretakers of his family`s summer mansion in Hoenn. However, it decides to travel with James and jumps into one of his Poké Balls. James is protective of Mime Jr. and doesn`t allow it to battle, but was used for contests instead.</description>

<description>Happiny are an exclusively female Pokémon that resemble Nurse Joy, with 3 round curls on their foreheads and a ponytail on top of their hair. The resemblance to Nurse Joy is probably linked to the fact its evolved forms (in the anime at least) work with Nurse Joy. Happiny like to carry egg-shaped objects in their pouches, imitating Chansey and Blissey, the Pokémon they may eventually become. This behavior is more than just play, however; a Happiny will evolve if it holds an Oval Stone upon leveling up during the daytime. In the Pokémon Diamond and Pearl games, Trainers are given a Happiny Egg to hatch and care for as they tour Hearthome City, home of Sinnoh`s Contest Hall. More Happiny can be hatched if their evolved forms hold Luck Incense during the breeding process in Solaceon City.
Happiny first appeared in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. In the episode "All Dressed Up With Somewhere To Go", Brock acquires an egg, which later hatches into a Happiny in "One Big Happiny Family!" there are rumours on internet forums saying that Happiny may evolve into Chansey and that this may bring about the end of Brock`s time on Pokemon breeding and traveling with Ash and co. If this was to happen then perhaps Max from the Hoenn series may return as the "informer" character having begun his own Pokemon journey. This however has no factual basis and is just a theory.</description>

<description>Chatot can learn and speak human words (known as Chatter). The ability to learn human words is rare. It may or may not be able to comprehend what it is actually saying though, much like real parrots. If they gather, they all learn the same saying. It can also mimic sounds. When a Chatot learns its signature move Chatter, the trainer can record a custom call from the game menu. The sound is garbled to avoid the recording of obscenities. The player can trade this Pokemon for a Buizel in Eterna City.
Its head is shaped like a musical note and its tail like a metronome. Its body is covered with many multi-colored feathers giving it a resemblance to a black masked lovebird. Chatot can only be caught in the morning or during the day.
Chatot also appears in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time/Darkness as the second in command to Guildmaster Wigglytuff.</description>

<description>Spiritomb, along with Sableye, shares the distinction of being one of only two Pokémon with no weakness. Since it is a combination Ghost/Dark type, no attack is "super effective" against it under normal circumstances. In addition, both Spiritomb and Sableye are, due to their typing, completely immune to Counter and Mirror Coat (unless moves such as Foresight or Miracle Eye are used), but not Metal Burst. Moves like Foresight and the ability Scrappy can negate its immunity to Fighting and Normal, allowing opponents to hit the Fighting weakness of its Dark typing. Its ability, Pressure, doubles the PP cost of any moves used by a foe. This ability, combined with its resistances and wide movepool of defensive moves, makes it a highly effective "tank".
According to its Pokédex entry, Spiritomb is a single entity composed of 108 evil spirits. Spiritomb has a strange connection to the number 108, being 108 kilograms (238.1 lbs.), #108 in the Sinnoh Pokedex, and having 108 as its base stat in defense and special defense. The number 108 is sacred in Hinduism and Buddhism. The entry also mentions that it was bound to a fissure in an Odd Keystone as punishment for misdeeds done 500 years ago. Also, if you take the difference between Spiritomb`s level-up moves (6), and multiply it by the total number of moves it can learn through level-up and egg moves (not counting repeats, 18), you get 108.
Champion Cynthia of the Sinnoh Pokémon League uses a Spiritomb in her team. It is level 61.</description>

<description>Gabite is Dragon/Ground like Gible. Being a Ground/Dragon pokémon, it is derived of the Dragon type`s protection against the Water and Grass types, and these inflict normal damage instead; Ice type attacks will instead of dealing two times the damage to Gabite deal four times the damage! On the other hand, Electric attacks will be totally negated since Gabite is Ground. Gabite evolves into Garchomp at level 48. There is a long-held belief that medicine made from its scales will heal even incurable illnesses. It habitually digs up and hoards gems in its nest. Its loot is constantly targeted by thieves and crooks.</description>

<description>Garchomp is the fourth-generation non-legendary Pokémon with high total stats (especially HP, Speed, and Attack); comparable to Metagross, Salamence, Tyranitar and Dragonite. It evolves from Gabite at Level 48. The Champion Cynthia of the Sinnoh Pokémon League has a Garchomp. Garchomp has earned some notoriety as only the second non-legendary Pokémon (after Wobbuffet) to be banned from standard gameplay.
Its appearance is based off a fictional creature known as a land shark or sand shark. In the anime, Cynthia uses Garchomp in her battle against Paul, where it managed to defeat his team with relative ease. They usually prey off of Zigzagoon, Bidoof, Barboach and Whiscash but their prime favorites are Corphish, Crawdaunt, Krabby and Kingler.</description>

<description>Munchlax is the pre-evolved form of Snorlax. It wolfs down its weight in food once a day, swallowing food whole with almost no chewing. It hides food under its long body hair. However, it sometimes forgets it has hidden the food there. Munchlax behaves quite opposite of its evolution, Snorlax, as it is somewhat hyperactive, though it is very similar with its eating patterns. It does not mind walking and running from place to place as it looks for food. Munchlax eats the most food of any Pokémon besides its evolution, Snorlax. It will eat nearly anything. It can rarely become full and will eat constantly, unlike Snorlax, who eats in between sleeping.
One can obtain a Munchlax by breeding two Snorlax with the mother holding a Full Incense, or by smearing honey on trees and waiting to see if it appears. However, it is the rarest Pokémon to catch by doing so. Wild Munchlax can only be found in honey trees in the games.</description>

<description>Hippowdon is the evolved form of Hippopotas. Sand appears to be coming out of the holes on its back. Its mouth can span seven feet. It is also mentioned, in a bookcase in Harbor Inn in Canalave City, that this Pokémon created the deserts of the world, but the spirit of the desert is Flygon, and the heat was created by Camerupt. Males are colored yellow, while females are colored black. It is interesting to note that males are yellow, so that in their desert environments, they have trouble finding each other to fight. The female is colored black for the opposite reason, so she is easy to find. In the 4th gen game series for Nintendo DS, Hippowdon has the special ability called "Sand Stream", which whips up a sandstorm whenever it is introduced into battle. The sandstorm will continue until another weather condition is set, or if for example Rayquaza is switched in (because Rayquaza has an ability to negate weather effects).</description>

Croagunk and its evolutionary form, Toxicroak, are a combination Poison/Fighting type, making it weak against Psychic moves, Flying moves, and Ground moves, but strong against Grass moves, Fighting moves, Poison moves, Dark moves, Bug moves, and Rock moves.
In the anime, Team Rocket leaves a Croagunk in the episode "Gymbaliar". Brock later befriends it and captures it. It has been known to use its Poison Jab move on Brock when he expresses interest in any woman. It takes the role of Misty and Max. It is a powerful fighter and only known losses were to Paul`s Torterra and Dawn`s Aipom, though it fought many Pokémon before it under Jessie`s control without rest.</description>

<description>Carnivine resemble venus fly traps; in fact, the Japanese name for this Pokémon is derived from the scientific name of the plant. Capable of levitation, it attracts its prey with its sweet-smelling saliva, then chomps down. It takes a whole day to eat its prey. Its diet consists chiefly of bugs (presumably weak ones, as ironically, Bug-type attacks are super effective against Carnivine).The only place Carnivine is obtainable is in the Great Marsh in Pastoria City.
In the Anime, James from Team Rocket has a Carnivine who always bites his head. This Carnivine is one of James` childhood Pokémon friends whose Poké Ball was hidden inside a box of bottle caps at his family`s cottage in the Sinnoh Region. James found it after years of separation. Like James` two Pokémon before it, Carnivine has a tendency to affectionately attack James when released from its Poké Ball. This follows the pattern of his earlier Grass-Type Pokémon, Victreebel and Cacnea, who used to attack him.</description>

<description>Snover is a "frosted tree Pokémon," that first appeared in the 4th generation of Pokémon. Snover is a small, tree-like Pokémon that appears mid to late game. On its head it has a white hat-like structure resembling a mountain with three peaks.
In the spring, frozen candy-like berries grow around its stomach which are similar to frozen treats. Because of its lack of human contact, Snover is known to be boldly inquisitive. Male and female Snover vary in appearance by their stomach`s pattern, with the male having an extra brown zigzag. Snover, and its evolution Abomasnow, is a unique Grass/Ice type, giving it many different abilities than most Grass or Ice types. Its Grass/Ice combination, unfortunately, makes it weak against Fire types, Fighting types, Poison types, Flying types, Bug types, Rock types, and Steel types. On the plus side, the Grass/Ice combination makes Snover and its evolutionary form, Abomasnow, strong against Water types, Electric types, Grass types, and Ground types.
The ability Snow Warning is also unique to Snover`s line, and causes the weather to change to hail when Snover is brought into battle. This hail does not disappear over time, but must be overridden by another weather changing move or ability.</description>

Weavile are known to travel and live in mating pairs and are very mischievous. They are also known to travel in larger groups as well of about four to five individuals, living in cold climates and hunting prey with impressive coordination. They convey messages to others by scratching odd symbols in ice or on the bark of trees. They made their first appearance in the 8th movie, Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew.

Magneton evolves from exposure to a unique magnetic field, which can only be found inside Mt. Coronet in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. This causes a mutation in the Magneton; one of the Magnemite that this Pokémon consists of has grown bigger than the other two; its pupil has dilated and turned red; and the screw on top appears to have been replaced by a yellow antenna upon evolution. The remaining Magnemite form the "shoulders" of Magnezone, and the screws on the top of their head have grown significantly larger. They also appear to have lost one magnet each. Magnezone has three horse-shoe magnets. Two are positioned in a fashion that resembles a pair of claws, and a third is positioned as a tail. Its body is surrounded by a thin metal rim. It is approximately three times heavier than Magneton. The body has a silver color like Magnezone`s pre-evolved forms. "Magneton must level up in Mt. Coronet in order to evolve"
In Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Darkness, a Magnezone serves as the police chief, taking away the outlaws the main character defeats.</description>

It does so when it knows the move Rollout and levels up, but only in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. This fact makes it one of only four Pokémon (the others being Mamoswine, Tangrowth, and Yanmega) that evolve from a previously obtainable Pokémon in a way that would have been possible in previous games: by learning a certain move. Not much else can be discerned from Lickilicky`s pre-evolved form, except it can learn Explosion, meaning that it is the only Pokémon (besides Smeargle through its unique Sketch move) that can learn Explosion and receive a Same Type Attack Bonus from it as well. It has a bizarre, rather swirly protusion on its head resembling hair. Lickilicky also has thumb spikes, and a white bib-like pattern on its chest in front of the neck. This design may be based on old 60-70`s diner mascots.</description>

In addition to its extra armor, it has developed an Ankylosaur-like tail, and holes in the palms of its hands, which it uses to fire rocks at enemies, thus why it learns the move Rock Wrecker.

It also doesn`t mind if its arms get torn off by enemies, because they soon regrow. Tangrowth`s vines also seem to have morphed together, whereas Tangela`s vines are all completely separate. Tangela must learn AncientPower in order to evolve in Tangrowth.</description>

It is one of the few evolving from the learned move Ancient Power (others are Mamoswine and Tangrowth), though there are other Pokémon who evolve from moves, but the moves differ between Pokémon. Ultrasonic waves coming from Yanmega`s wings can cause lethal damage to a foe`s internal organs. It is known as the largest Bug Pokémon. It also has the highest Special Attack stat of all Bug-type Pokémon. Yanmega resembles a giant dragonfly, as does its pre-evolution, Yanma. Both Yanma and Yanmega`s names are derived from "Oniyanma", the largest of dragonfly species in Japan.
In the anime, Jessie owns a Yanmega. She captured it as a Yanma and gave it to Giovanni, but he rejected it and sent it back to her. She then trained it herself and evolved into Yanmega in the same episode.</description>

Porygon-Z`s appearance is similar to that of Porygon and Porygon2, which were supposedly earlier designs by Silph Co. The programming added to create Porygon-Z was intended to allow it to surpass all other Pokemon, but as a result, Porygon-Z began to exhibit odd behaviors and the data used to program it became glitched giving it its odd appearance.
Porygon`s evolutionary line is notable for being the only evolutionary line that contains two evolutions triggered through trading. Porygon-Z is notable for having the highest Special Attack, one of two statistics that influence the power of an attack, among non-legendary Pokemon. It shares this title with another Pokemon, Alakazam.
However after the notorious episode of Pokemon causing seizures to many Japanese viewers (Dennou Senshi Porygon), Porygon-Z has never appeared in the Pokemon anime.</description>

This Pokémon can only be a male, evolving from a male Kirlia when exposed to a Dawn Stone. The crest on its head is reminiscent of the helmet of a hoplite. Sharp, green, spear-like blades extend from Gallade`s elbows, which Gallade uses skillfully and powerfully in battle. These blades can be retracted into Gallade`s elbows when not in combat, possibly so that it does not somehow manage to hurt those it is close to. As its evolutionary line and Gardevoir resemble elegant female dancers, Gallade may be a dancer as well. If true, Gallade may be based partly on a traditional Brazilian dance called Maculelê, which involves dancing through expressive and athletic motions and a form of sword play. Gallade are valiant and noble fighters, adept at both melee combat and swordplay. They are noble in the sense that they follow strict codes of manners and conduct in and outside of battles. This sense of honor can be compared to that of a samurai`s or knight`s. Their behavior is quite similar, in that a Gallade, as well as a Gardevoir, will protect its trainer, even if doing so could end its life. Their names are based on the word "gallant" and "blade", which represents them in many ways.</description>

<description>Probopass, known as the Compass Pokémon, is one of several Pokémon from Pokémon Diamond and Pearl that evolves from a Pokémon that was released in a previous generation. Probopass evolves from a Nosepass that has leveled up on Mt. Coronet. Probopass resembles the Groucho Marx comical glasses in some aspects, with small round eyes, in contrast to Nosepass`s perpetually closed ones. It also bears a small resemblance to the Nintendo character Mario.[citation needed] Its nose is much bigger in proportion to its body and has a bushy "moustache." The "moustache" appears to be iron filings caught by a magnet. Female Probopass retain the "moustache", despite the existence of gender differences for various different Pokémon species. It controls three small objects on its sides and back that look like Nosepass, which are not connected to the body; they are called "mini-noses" by the in-game Pokédex entry.</description>

<description>Dusknoir, known as the Gripper Pokémon, is the evolution of Dusclops, obtained by trading a Dusclops that is holding a Reaper Cloth. It appears only in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. Dusknoir`s body is mostly black, with four almond shaped eye-like markings (two in the front, two in the back) and a yellow horizontal zigzag line below the "eyes" along which the entire torso can open and close like a mouth, giving the impression of a face. This "face" also glows brightly when Dusknoir powers up for attacks. Dusknoir now has developed arms. Two yellow bands are near its wrists and its grey hands are similar to Dusclops`. Dusknoir has a grey, cylinder-shaped head with another yellow band near the top and a single black eye with a yellow iris and a red pupil. On top of its head is a yellow antenna which allows this Pokémon to receive transmissions from the spirit world, from where it receives commands to take people there; due to the presence of an actual "spirit world" in the games ruled by the Legendary Pokémon Giratina, a ghastly dragon that represents death, it is speculated that it is Giratina that gives orders to Dusknoir. In addition, it may have ties to the Grim Reaper, as the player needs a Reaper Cloth in order for it to evolve as well as it being a Gripper Pokemon, a possible portmanteau of "Grim" and "Reaper" altered to fit Dusknoir`s grabbing persona. Dusknoir has a ghostly tail instead of feet like Dusclops, resembling the stereotypical depiction of a genie. Its name can be translated as "black dusk", "noir" meaning "black" in French.
A male Dusknoir appears in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness as the main villain of the game. He is a tyrant from the future world and deceives everyone into trusting him and outing Grovyle as a villain, but in fact, he is an agent of Primal Dialga</description>

<description>Froslass, known as the Snow Land Pokémon, appears to be based on the Yuki-onna, a Japanese snow spirit, hence being a Ghost-type. It bears a humanoid appearance (unlike Snorunt or Glalie). Its main body color is white with a red stripe around the waist and two red fins on her back (designed to resemble a kimono obi). Froslass`s arms are attached to its head as opposed to its torso, and each has a three-fingered hand and a blue fin on the wrist (representing the sleeves of a kimono). The head is round except for a bump on the back and has a purple lower jaw. Two small blue "horns" made of ice are on Froslass`s head, along with a purple diamond-shaped crater in the center of its forehead. Froslass doesn`t have any feet, so it floats in the air like its counter-part, Glalie. Its torso appears to be hollow, as it is stated in the Pokédex`s entry for Froslass. A female Snorunt will evolve into Froslass after a Dawn Stone is used on it.
It attacks prey and unsuspecting victims in icy snowstorms, where its Snow Cloak ability allows it to go unseen (yuki-onna are said to have skin so pale that they can actually blend into their snow-covered surroundings). To render its foes and victims helpless, it blows an icy wind that can reach as low as -60˚F. Its head has a slight resemblance to Celebi`s.
A Froslass appears in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness, as a dangerous and obsessive Pokémon, who is attracted to the famous explorer Scizor, who doesn`t exactly return those affections. As a result, she kidnaps him and freezes him in ice. But when the player and partner intervene, Frosslass is stopped.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Rotom, known as the Plasma Pokémon, is a small, floating Pokémon whose body consists of plasma, which can infiltrate electronic devices. They are mischievous, and wreak havoc on electrical appliances just for the fun of it. Pokémon Platinum introduced five new forms of Rotom: Frost Rotom, Wash Rotom, Mow Rotom, Fan Rotom, and Heat Rotom. Each form`s appearance corresponds to a household appliance (a refrigerator, a washing machine, a lawn mower, a desk fan, and an oven, respectively). In the Pokémon universe, researchers are looking into Rotom as the power source of a unique motor.
Rotom are shaped like lightning rods, while the blue aura of electricity around them takes the appearance of lightning. Rotom`s eyes and aura of electricity change colors when it changes form. Rotom`s looks and abilities were inspired by Pulseman, a game that GameFreak worked on before Pokémon. Rotom is the word motor backwards; this may refer to the fact that motors make many appliances function, while Rotom makes them fail.
The only available Rotom in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl resides in a possessed television in an old haunted château. You can only catch him after 8:00 PM but before 4:00 AM. In North America, Toys R Us gave out Secret Keys, which unlocked Rotom`s forms, via Mystery Gift from April 20, 2009 to May 12, 2009. The alternate forms of Rotom may also be accessed in Silph Co. in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver. In the anime, Rotom made its debut appearance in Get Your Rotom Running! in all its different forms, toying around with Ash and friends. In Pokémon Adventures, Rotom appeared in the television at the Old Chateau.</description>

<description>Uxie, known as the Knowledge Pokémon, has a yellow and round head with a jewel (probably a ruby), embedded in its forehead, and in its Sugimori art it appears to be sleeping, or closing its eyes in deep thought. Uxie`s name comes from the word pixie, a small mythical creature, and "you", U being short for it. The other members of the Psychic-type, Mew like Lake Trio, Mesprit and Azelf, represent "me" and "us", respectively. It is also a possibility that these three Pokémon are inspired from a trio of Arabian goddesses, Al-Lat (Azelf), Manat (Mesprit), and Al-Uzza (Uxie). This is further supported by their moniker as Mirage Pokémon (as mirages are something associated with the Arabian desert), and that the three appear to be wearing jeweled turbans, which are associated with Arabic royalty. Uxie`s eyelids are also yellow, although they are obviously not part of the top of the head where the other yellow is. Uxie also resembles a religious monk. Its head resembles a human brain, since it is the Knowledge Pokémon. Like Mesprit and Azelf, its partners in the legendary trio, it has two tails with jewels embedded in them, and the only major difference between them is their heads and their faces. It is also believed that the mystic trio was all hatched from the same egg.
Uxie is referred to as "The Being of Knowledge". It is said that the wisdom that enriches the lives of humans was brought with the birth of Uxie. Similar to the legend of the basilisk where the basilisk could cause death by a single glance, Uxie can cause a complete loss of memory by a single glance of its open eyes; hence, its eyes are always closed, even when it is in battle.</description>

<description>Mesprit, known as the Emotion Pokémon, is a legendary Pokémon that is part of the Psychic-type Lake Trio along with Uxie and Azelf. Mesprit`s name comes from the word sprite, a tiny fairy found in fantasy and fairy tales, or spirit, as its spirit often exits its body, leaving it on the bottom of Lake Verity. It has a small blue body about the size of Mew, and is identical to Uxie and Azelf except for its head. It has a pink head with a jewel embedded in its forehead, and four long ears drooping down its head looking like those of Lucario.
Mesprit is referred to as "The Being of Emotion," and said to have taught humans to sense emotions such as sorrow, pain and joy. If a human touches it, three days after the touch, the person will lose their emotions. Cyrus is one example. When you attempt to capture it, it will roam around Sinnoh. It is thought to have come from the same egg as Uxie and Azelf.</description>

Referred to as "The Being of Willpower", it can either make people give up on an activity or cause them to attempt the activity repeatedly. Also, if a human is to harm Azelf, in a scant five days, the offender would be immobile for all eternity. Residing and sleeping at the base of Lake Valor, it keeps the world in balance. It`s believed to have come from the same egg as Uxie and Mesprit.</description>

It is similar to the three Regis - Regirock, Regice, and Registeel - in both name, body structure and the fact that all Regis are weak to Fighting-type attacks. It will only appear in the game if the three Regis, after being transferred via Pal Park, are in your party while examining Regigigas` body. Regigigas was sealed in the Snowpoint Temple for thousands of years, so long that moss have grown over its body, and modern humans thought it was just a statue of the Pokémon. A Sinnoh legend has it in the past Regigigas towed continents using ropes. The legend says that it had unbelievable strength, but seemingly since it has not used it in ages, it has trouble getting its act together at the beginning of a battle, evidenced by its ability, Slow Start. In Platinum, Regigigas` level is reduced to 1, making it the lowest level non-glitch wild &amp; legendary Pokémon, more evidence of the fact that it has not used its powers for millennia.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Phione, known as the Sea Drifter Pokémon, is a Pokémon that can be obtained by breeding Manaphy and Ditto, though Phione will not evolve into Manaphy.
It is currently the only Pokémon that cannot evolve into the Pokémon from which it is bred, and it is the only Pokémon able to be bred from a legendary. Phione itself can breed with Ditto, but it will only produce other Phione and not a Manaphy. Because of Phione`s relation to Manaphy, there is evidence on both sides of the issue of Phione`s status (or lack thereof) as a legendary Pokémon. As it is the offspring of a legendary, and is banned from the Sinnoh Battle Tower, many people think it is a legendary. However, its lackluster stats and ability to breed more of itself lent evidence to the idea that Phione was not a legendary. Its legendary status was eventually confirmed by Pokemon.com. Many things that Manaphy has two of, Phione only has one of (Phione has one antenna, only one gem on its stomach, and has one "eyelash" coming from each eye, while Manaphy has two of these).
Since it is the product of a bred Manaphy, they share many traits. It is the same shade of blue, it has the same large eyes, only blue, and has eyelash markings similar to Manaphy. It has a large knob-shaped bump on its head from which extends a long, ribbon-like antenna, somewhat resembling a sailor`s cap, though in fact it is a flotation device. Instead of feet, it has a small point, similar to Baltoy. Instead of two jewels, it has a single red gem in the middle of its tiny body. It has two large fins in proportion to its body, which it uses to navigate through the oceans that it lives in. While Manaphy is said to live in cold seas, it is said Phione live in warm seas.</description>

<description>Manaphy, known as the Seafaring Pokémon, made its debut is in the 9th Pokémon anime film, Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea, and is thought to be the "Prince of the Sea" Pokémon alluded to in the title of the Japanese movie. It was the sixth Pokémon of the fourth generation to be revealed by CoroCoro magazine. It was revealed alongside the silhouettes of three other Pokémon: Mantyke, Buizel, and Chatot.
Many years ago, a Phione accidentally laid a mysterious, bright blue egg with a red heart inside it. It eventually hatched into a smaller Phione, which was named Manaphy. Many Phione began to worship it and Manaphy became the "Prince of the Sea". When bred with Ditto, Manaphy is able to produce more Phione.
Manaphy are blue blob-like Pokémon. They have two long antennae extending from atop their head. At the end of these antennae are round objects that resemble a ball. Manaphy can use their antennae to use Heart Swap and switch people`s energy. They also have jewel-like markings on their stomachs, one large red gem and a very small yellow gem. They are said to live in cold waters, and migrate miles away from their homes only to return. Manaphy can mimic human language as the Manaphy in Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea was able to say certain words and sentences.
Manaphy is only obtainable through a Nintendo Event, or by completing Pokémon Ranger and defeating the special Manaphy mission, which will only become available after the player inputs a password. This password has been revealed by Nintendo on numerous occasions.</description>

<description>Darkrai, known as the Pitch-Black Pokémon, is a legendary Pokémon resembling a dark, sinister ghost, such as the Grim Reaper. Darkrai is a living nightmare, or a manifestation of many nightmares. Darkrai is made by necromancy and pitch-black magic. The top of its body is connected to the lower half by a tiny waist, giving it a figure shaped like an hourglass. A white substance flows from its head, obscuring much of its facial features. Its club-shaped arms have three claws each, with parts of them appearing tattered. It`s shoulders also have long tatters as well. Darkrai possesses the power to lure people into deep sleeps and show them frightning nightmares, which sometimes make it impossible to wake up. Darkrai resides on Newmoon Island, (Mirror-image of fullmoon island in which Cresselia resides) and on nights of the new moon; when it is active, it shows horrible nightmares.
Darkrai was released on July 19th, 2007 in Japan with the movie Dialga vs. Palkia vs. Darkrai, and it was released in the United States in Toys R` Us stores shortly after the showing of the English adaptation, The Rise of Darkrai. In the anime, it was featured in the movie Pokémon: The Rise of Darkrai, in which it stops Palkia and Dialga from destroying Alamos Town. He was voiced by Bill Rogers in the film.
It is the only Dark-type legendary Pokémon to date, unless Arceus is holding the Dread Plate. Its signature move, "Dark Void", attempts to put all opponents to sleep. Coupled with excellent offenses, Darkrai is not permitted in standard battling.</description>

Its body`s fur is pure white and instead of quills, Shaymin has green grass growing on its back along with pink flowers growing on the sides of its head, giving it an even more flower-like appearance. Its cry is similar to birdsong. Shaymin resides in the Flower Paradise, a flower-filled field untouched by humans. You find it at level 30. In order to go unnoticed by intruders or attackers, it utilizes its own form of camouflage, rolling up into a ball resembling a flower in a patch of grass. By doing so, it blends in with the surrounding flowers, going undetected even if the attacker is beside it. Shaymin also has the power to decompose the toxins in the air and turn the land into flower fields in an instant. It is rumored to have turned the desolate area of Floaroma Town into a fertile field. The only way to capture Shaymin without the use of glitches or cheats is to receive the item Oak`s Letter from a Nintendo Event. It is featured in the movie Giratina and the Sky Warrior. A new form has been confirmed for Shaymin called the Sky Forme, which appears in Pokemon Platinum; in this form, it appears more as a terrier than it does a hedgehog, and has large wing-like ears. Its signature move is "Seed Flare".</description>

<description>Arceus, known as the Alpha Pokémon or "The Original One", is the ultimate legendary Pokémon. Arceus premiered with the fourth generation but did not appear (without cheats) in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. It has a silver-coloured body and has a large, golden wheel around its abdomen, connected by spikes filled with gems. It is said in a book called "The Original Story" that Arceus was born from an egg in a vortex of pure chaos. After it was born, it created two beings from itself: one of time, one of space Palkia, and then three more beings, named Dialga, Palkia, Azelf, Uxie, and Mesprit respectively. The two former created matter and the latter three created spirit, while Arceus entered an eternal sleep. This story can be found in the Canalave Library, and can also be told from the various elemental plates the player encounters in the story. This story appears to contradict that of Mew being the ancestor of all Pokémon.
Arceus has the Multitype Ability, which allows the player to change Arceus` type from Normal to any of the other sixteen types by having it hold various elemental plates found throughout the game. Arceus` signature move, Judgment (Learned at level 100), uses the same typing as the held elemental plate. Arceus also has the highest base stat total of any Pokémon to date, which makes it the strongest Pokémon of all time excluding Primal forms and Mega Evolutions. (Its Base Stat Total is 720, with each stat having a value of 120. There are many that beat Arceus in each category individually, but its BST is unmatched among standard form Pokemon.) Due to its power and rarity, it is known by many fans as the "God of Pokemon".
Officially, Nintendo has not released further details on Arceus in Japan or the United States. The only way for players to currently capture Arceus is through cheats or glitches such as using a Gameshark or an Action Replay DS and by using the event item, The Azure Flute which has only been distributed in Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum versions. Arceus has also been distributed in various events in around the world.</description>

Giratina represents the Dimensions (or perhaps inter-dimensional travel, because space and time, which lie under the control of Palkia and Dialga respectively, are dimensions in themselves). Giratina is described in the Pokémon video games as a creature that lives in a world on the reverse side of the human world. This area is in a cemetery-like ruin in the depths of Turnback Cave, a place where the dimensional boundaries are said to be distorted, and dead Pokémon are able to enter the physical world. Giratina has a long, platinum-colored, segmented body with six legs, and has ghostly wings with spikes. Giratina is featured prominently in the upcoming film `Giratina and the Sky`s Warrior` (Giratina to Sora no Hanataba: Sheimi) and in the game Pokémon Platinum where it has a new form called "Origin Forme" (オリジンフォルム), which is similar to its regular form except it has a slightly different face, wing shape, and spikes in place of legs, becoming more serpentine.
Giratina is infamous as an extremely durable wall, with astronomical defensive statistics. Its Origin Forme trades its defenses for improved offenses, but it is limited to the Platinum Orb as a hold item.
Giratina`s Another Forme looks like a basilisk, it has a beak-like mouth, it has a crown on the head, it has red eyes, it has big spikey wings, it has six legs, a serpent tail, and a bird-like cry.</description>

<description>Jessie is one half of of the Team Rocket duo that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokemon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
Jessie`s mother, Miyamoto, was a high-ranking Team Rocket agent. When Jessie was around the age of three, Miyamoto left on a mission to the Andes Mountains to record the voice of the elusive Pokemon Mew. However, Miyamoto disappeared, and Jessie was put into a foster home which had very little money. There were times when she had no choice but to eat snow because of a lack of more nourishing food.
When she was old enough, she left home to become a Pokemon nurse in Jouto. However, the school she was enrolled in was literally for Pokemon nurses (i.e. Chansey), so she failed to graduate and left, leaving behind a Chansey she had befriended there. It is assumed that she then traveled back to Kanto, where she enrolled in Pokemon Tech, a trainer`s school, met James, and subsequently failed and dropped out. After this, Jessie and James joined a bicycle gang in Sunny Town, where Jessie was known for swinging a chain above her head as she rode her bike (nicknamed "Chainer Jess").
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between Jessie and James after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Sometime before joining Team Rocket, and it is not known when, Jessie obtained a Contest Pass in the Hoenn region. Also during the years before Team Rocket, she had several boyfriends, all of whom left her and/or treated her badly. In "Xatu the Future", she revealed that she had once worked at a T.V. station as the Weathergirl. In "From Cradle to Save" is also revealed that she once was a ninja.
She has a long-standing bitter rivalry with Cassidy, another member of Team Rocket. Another member, Wendy, held a grudge against Jessie for failing to pay for a drink (making Wendy pay), but got her revenge when she added the charge to Jessie`s overall Team Rocket bill.
In the episode "Ignorance is Blissey", Jessie was reunited with her friend Chansey from the Pokemon nurse school; Chansey had since evolved into a Blissey.
Starting in Hoenn, Jessie has become a Pokemon Coordinator, entering every contest that she could. She frequently makes it to the battle round, but usually loses there. However, in "Borrowing on Bad Faith", she finally succeeded in winning an (unofficial) contest by using Ash`s Aipom, which she had saved earlier in the episode. And, in "Team Shocker!", she finally wins an official contest with her Dustox in at Solaceon City. Later she also won a ribbon with help of her Yanmega. She has Contest Passes to compete in the Hoenn, Kanto, and Sinnoh regions.
While Jessie`s role in the Pokemon anime has not yet ended, in Toshihiro Ono`s manga, "The Electric Tale of Pikachu", she ended up married to James and with child.
Jessie seems to have a special preference for snake-like Pokemon, owning both an Arbok and a Seviper. In "The Ninja Poke Showdown", she expressed a preference for Poison-type Pokemon in general.
For unknown reasons, she, James and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation.
In the Kanto contests, Jessie disguises herself as Jessebella (which is similar to James former fiancee Jessiebelle) wearing a red dress and glasses. Eventually, Ash, Brock, Max and May finds out her true identity at the last contest.
During the Kanto Grand Festival, Jessie dresses up as Jessadia (Japanese: キャンディ・ムサリーナ Candy Musalina). and wears glasses, long white socks, a yellow and orange dress, and has her hair in pigtails. She works there as an announcer and Lilian Meridian`s assistant; Lilian herself says she may not really like "Jessadia"`s style, but recognizes her talent. In the Latin American dub, she enters Super Contests under the name Jessiebella (referencing Jessiebelle again). Jessie currently still continues to use the Jessalina disguise while participating in Super Contests.
In "Pruning a Passel of Pals!" and "Strategy With a Smile!" she once again used her Jessadia disguise to report on the Wallace Cup.
Although Jessie had entered mostly every contest in Hoenn &amp; Kanto, she lost in every single one, whether it was the first match of the Battle Rounds or the finals. But in the Sinnoh Region, she has so far won 2 ribbons using her Dustox and Yanmega.</description>

<description>Meowth is a very unique Pokémon as it has many of the characteristics of a human. It walks on two feet, talks and is as smart as any human. Meowth is currently a member of Team Rocket and he travels around with Jessie and James trying to capture Pikachu and other rare Pokémon for Giovanni.
Meowth generally finishes his sentences with "Nyaa (ニャー)" which is the equivalent of "meow" in English. This helps people remember that despite his ability to talk like a human, he still has cat character traits.
Meowth is also known for coming up with his many schemes to try to capture Pikachu. While Jessie and James always agree with Meowth and think his plans are brilliant, they are generally foiled by Ash and his friends.
Long Con to Access Raimon City Pokémon Center
Meowth schemed with Jessie, James and Doctor Zager to figure out a way for them to infiltrate the Raimon City Pokémon Center where high-leveled Pokémon are stored in a vault that is protected by a security machine scan system that would only open if Nurse Joy (Isshu) or Nurse Joy`s Audino were scanned. Meowth pretended to be no longer part of Team Rocket making up a story that his made an error while executing a certain operation and when headquarters hear of his mistake, they told him he was fired.
Ash, Iris and Cilan believed him and allowed Meowth to travel with him. Pikachu though didn`t trust Meowth even though Meowth proved on numerous occasion that it should be trusted. Meowth`s plan was put into action when they arrived at the Raimon City Pokémon Center and as soon as Nurse Joy`s Audino was scanned to open the door, Meowth turned on Pikachu and the other and captured all the Pokémon in the vault. The long con had been a success and Meowth met up with Jessie and James below the Pokémon Center. Unfortunately, they weren`t able to get away as Ash and his friends realized that Meowth had just been conning them and they were able to stop Team Rocket.</description>

<description>James is one part of of the Team Rocket trio that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokémon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
James is mostly a comedic parody of bishounen characters; the English dub in particular tends to give him a melodramatic and even campy tone. He is somewhat famous for carrying a rose, though in more recent episodes he does not display it often. Mostly, his rose is displayed in the Team Rocket motto.
The only child of millionaires, James was forced to endure formal society. At a young age, he was forcefully engaged to a girl of whom he was terrified, Jessiebelle, all because his parents wanted to have a wealthy daughter-in-law. Thus, he ran away from home, leaving behind his beloved pet Growlie. He attempted to enroll in Pokémon Tech, a trainer`s school, but, along with his new friend Jessie, flunked out. Then, with Jessie, he joined the Sunny Town bicycle gang, where he was popular for being the only gang member to have to use training wheels (nicknamed "Trainer Jim"). Eventually James, Jessie, and the bike gang went their separate ways.
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between James and Jessie after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Since he is proficient in several activities, including Pokémon haiku and PokéRinger, it is possible that he developed his skills during his temporary separation from Jessie, but this is not known for sure.
In the episode "Holy Matrimony!", James returned to his home as a result of a trap by his parents, who pretended to be dead. He was reunited with his old pet Growlie and managed to avoid marrying Jessiebelle. Growlie stayed behind when James returned to Jessie and Meowth.
James has a tendency to be swindled by a Magikarp Salesman, who has on many occasions tricked him into buying a Magikarp or other useless Pokémon and items for large sums of money.
James also has a tendency to cross-dress, but has not done it since "Pros and Con Artists". He does, however, dress up like famous celebrities as well, such as Professor Oak, Juan, and Norman.
James loves rare bottle caps and has an impressive collection of them. In the episode "All That Glitters!" it is revealed that he has "drunk enough soda pop to float an aircraft carrier".
For unknown reasons, he, Jessie and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation. However in newer episodes the balloon is shown with `jets` attached to explain how they get from one place to another faster than walking.</description>

<description>The Beginning
Ash is the main character of the Pokémon anime. Raised in Pallet Town, he started his journey to become a Pokémon Master at the age of 10. On the day that he started his journey, Ash carelessly woke up late despite being told by his mother, Delia Ketchum to get to bed. He rushed to Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory only to find out that the beginner Pokémon - Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander - had already been given out to trainers who arrived on time. However, Professor Samual Oak mentioned that there was one more Pokémon available - Pikachu. Despite constantly hitting Ash with Electric-type attacks and refusing to return to its PokéBall, Ash decided to take Pikachu along with him on his journey to become a Pokémon Master. Pikachu is cold towards Ash at first and laughs at his failures; however, when Ash saves Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow, he begins to warm up to his new trainer and the two finally become friends. After the battle with the flock of Spearow, a Ho-Oh is seen flying towards a rainbow in the sky. The PokéDex reveals that the Ho-Oh is an unidentified Pokémon. Thus, the journey of Ash and Pikachu begins.
Captures in Viridian Forest
While making his way towards Pewter City and his first Kanto League Gym Battle, Ash came upon a wild Caterpie deep within Viridian Forest. Instead of using Pikachu to battle against the wild Pokémon, Ash took his chances and threw a PokéBall without weakining the Caterpie first. Luckily, he was able to catch the Pokémon without any trouble. The capture of Ash`s Caterpie marked Ash`s first capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Caterpie the second Pokémon to join his team.
The next day, while continuing the trek through the Viridian Forest, Ash came up on a wild Pidgeotto. He tried to just throw a PokéBall like he did with Ash`s Caterpie, but Pidgeotto swatted the PokéBall away. Misty informed that he must weaken the Pokémon first before attempting to capture it. He called out Ash`s Caterpie to battle against, but Misty quickly informed him that Bug-type Pokémon are weak against Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeotto. After Pidgeotto dealt significant damage to Ash`s Caterpie, Ash recalled it and sent out Pikachu. Pikachu was able to use its Thundershock to weaken Pidgeotto and allow Ash to capture it with a PokéBall. Thus, this capture marked Ash`s second capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Pidgeotto the third Pokémon to join his team.
Later on, while still in the Viridian Forest, Ash was approached by Team Rocket, who attempted to steal his Pokémon. After defeating Meowth, James`s Koffing, and Jessie`s Ekans, Ash`s Caterpie evolved into Ash`s Metapod.
Some of Ash`s greatest accomplishments have been at the various Pokémon Leagues. He was the victor at the Orange League and the Battle Frontier. He also competed in the Indigo League and the Johto Silver Conference where he placed admirably in both those competitions as well.
Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup
Ash participated in the Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup at the Kagome Town stadium. In the first round he was in the fifth match and faced off against Marris. The match was quickly showcased and Ash won the battle and advanced to the second round while Marris was eliminated from the tournament.
The Isshu League
Ash participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where he was matched up against Trip. Trip`s Serperior was sent out to battle Pikachu and Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior`s speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter Trip`s Serperior speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round. The two met in the Pokémon Center after the battle, and Trip vowed that the next time they met that he would win. The two shook hands and parted ways.
In the first main round, Ash`s opponent was shown on the match up electronic board but not much else is known about the battle. Ash`s Scraggy participated in the second main round of the Isshu League tournament where it faced off against a Darumakka. It was able to defeat it so that moved on to the next round.
In the third round, Stephan was matched up against Ash. Cilan noted that the two of them have a very direct taste and that it would be a good battle. It was only a 3 on 3 battle but the both of them gave it their all. The first two battles of the third round setup the final match up of Stephan`s Sawk vs Ash`s Krookodile, both of which were very injured from the previous battles. Both of them did their best to muster up their reserve strength but in the end a surprise move of Aerial Ace by Ash`s Krookodile was super effective against Stephan`s Sawk and it knocked it out to give Ash the victory while eliminating Stephan from the tournament. Stephan realized after the battle that the reason that Ash withdrew Waruvial after the first battle was because Ash knew that Stephan would definitely send out Dageki, so he didn`t reveal that it knew Aerial Ace and saved until the end.</description>

<description>The Beginning
On the morning that Ash was to start his Pokémon journey, he woke up late and by the time he reached Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory, all of the beginner Pokémon were already taken. However, Professor Samual Oak did have one Pokémon left, a wild Pikachu. At first, Pikachu did not like Ash and would refuse to enter his PokéBall. He would often laugh at Ash`s failures and refused to listen to him. However, after Ash proved his loyalty to Pikachu by protecting him from a flock of Spearow, and thus began to earn Pikachu`s trust and respect. The two have since become best friends and Pikachu never leaves Ash`s side.
Since the day Team Rocket first encountered Pikachu, it has been their sole goal to capture it. Day after day, their plan to capture Pikachu has been thwarted mainly due to Pikachu`s amazingly powerful Thunderbolt that keeps on blasting them off.
On numerous occasions, Pikachu has made it evident that he is happy being a Pikachu and has no desire to evolve into a more powerful Raichu. It has proven time and time again that it is a powerful and worthy opponent to any Pokémon that dares to battle it.
Gym Battle against Burgh`s Leavanny
Pikachu was then sent out to battle Burgh`s Leavanny. Burgh`s Leavanny managed to tie up Pikachu with String Shot but unlike Ash`s Swadloon who was able to break free, Pikachu ended up getting hit with a couple of Leaf Storm attacks and a Hyper Beam before it rolled into another of Burgh`s Leavanny`s Leaf Storm attacks to break the string off its body so it could attack. Freed from the String Shot, Burgh`s Leavanny tried to tie it up again but Pikachu managed to avoid it with its speed and then knocked Burgh`s Leavanny out with a combination of Iron Tail and Electro Ball.
Gym Battle against Elesa
Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy and was then matched up with Pikachu. Pikachu made quick work of Elesa`s Emolga and knocked it out with one attack, its Iron Tail.
Elesa`s Tynamo was the last Pokémon that she used in her gym battle against Ash. It was matched up against Pikachu who had just defeated her Emonga. Pikachu had a hard time defending against the fast Tackle attack that Elesa`s Tynamo kept hitting it with but Pikachu used its Thunderbolt to create a large dust cloud leaving only a small corridor for Pikachu to focus on it and so Elesa`s Tynamo couldn`t maneuver out of the way. Pikachu one hit K.O`d Elesa`s Tynamo with a Iron Tail. The loss gave Ash the overall victory.
Battle against Alder`s Bouffalant
Ash challenged Alder to a battle and he accepted though he had been walking all night and was actually quite tired. Alder sent out his Buffron to battle Pikachu but just as the battle started, Alder fell asleep standing up and didn`t give any orders to his Buffron. Alder`s Bouffalant stood still as Pikachu began hitting it with attack after attack until it Alder`s Bouffalant finally got mad at Alder and charged at him and set him flying into a tree. After that, Alder`s Bouffalant no longer wished to battle and Alder conceded the battle.
Gym Battle against Skyla
In Skyla air battle simulation, Ash`s Tranquill was matched up against Skyla`s Unfezant and since her Pokémon was the highest evolved form, she determined that her Pokémon would be the winner in that match-up. In the actual gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was up against Skyla`s Unfezant which was the match-up just after Ash`s Tranquill had defeated Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla`s Unfezant proved to be stronger and faster than Ash`s Tranquill, so Ash recalled it and set out Pikachu. Pikachu had a definite advantage over Skyla`s Unfezant with its electric attacks and it quickly knocked it out with its Electro Ball attack.
Ash Just after Pikachu ended up knocking out Skyla`s Unfezant, Skyla`s Swanna was sent out to battle against it. Skyla had been watching her grandpa`s battle videos and noticed that he used the move Aqua Ring to defend against Electric attacks. She used that same defense against Pikachu which nullified its Electric attacks. It`s Iron Tail also couldn`t hit it so high in the air. Ash then noticed the rings in the air and Pikachu jumped up on them and managed to hit Skyla`s Swanna but not directly. Pikachu was now up in the air though and Skyla`s Swanna had the advantage there and it quickly knocked Pikachu out with a powerful Brave Bird attack.
Battle Against Trip`s Serperior at the Isshu League
Pikachu participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where it is was matched up against Trip`s Serperior. Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter its speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round.</description>

<description>While traveling in the Isshu region just outside of Kanako Town, Ash mistakenly thought Iris was a Pokémon and threw a monster ball at her. Ash thought she was a Axew as the Zukan displayed the data for it. Her Axew appeared out of her large hair moments later though. After learning that Cilan was going to be traveling with Ash through the Isshu region, Iris decided that she would travel with them as well but she said that her goal on this journey was a secret.
In the games, Iris is one of the gym leaders of Souryuu City`s Gym but it is currently unknown if she holds the same title in the anime.
Displeasure of Ice Pokémon
Just before Ash and Trip`s three-on-three battle, Iris encountered Trip`s Vanillite. She instantly tried to avoid it and started to shiver. She explained that since Dragon types have a disadvantage against Ice types, she dislike the cold that Ice Pokémon create. Trip tried to confront her about her dislike of Ice Pokémon by telling her that Dragon Pokémon are also strong against Dragon Pokémon but she only reluctantly apologized to Trip`s Vanillite and her mind wasn`t truly changed.
Making up with Excadrill
Excadrill didn`t always want to obey Iris when its asked to do something. For awhile, it was stubborn but Iris`s Excadrill was able to overcome the feelings of resentment and lost of trust it felt from the battle against Drayden`s Haxorus. After relating her experience to Ash and Cilan, it became more clear to Iris that she was not fully understanding her Excadrill`s feelings. Iris apologized to her Excadrill as she finally realized that her Excadrill knew after the first hit during the battle against Drayden`s Haxorus that they couldn`t win against it. The two of them then practiced all through the night until Excadrill was finally able to successfully launch the Focus Blast.
Rival Langley
While on route to Raimon City, Iris encountered Georgia, a Dragon Buster who once had a battle in the Dragon Village and her Pokémon was beaten up and now has it out for anyone from the village. Georgia managed to coax Iris into a battle but Iris`s Axew was no match for Georgia`s Beartic and Georgia ended up intimidating and angering Iris by saying the victory was easy and boring. Iris though was determined to defeat her new rival and during the rematch battle she managed to end it in a draw.
Don Battles
Iris entered the Don Battles, a battle tournament to be held in Raimon Town, with her friends and rivals. Jimmy Ray was easily defeated in the first round by Iris.
Stephan`s Sawk battled against Iris`s Emolga in the second round of the Don George Battle Tournament in Raimon Town but Emonga`s Static ability proved to be the deciding factor in the match. The Static ability ended up paralyzing Stephan`s Sawk and it was then a sitting target for Iris`s Emolga`s Volt Switch which knocked it out. Iris`s Emolga`s win eliminated Stephan from the tournament.
Iris`s Axew and Luke`s Golett were matched up in the semi-final round of the Don Battles in Raimon Town. Luke`s Golett dominated most of the battle and just as Iris`s Axew was about to be defeated, it learned the move Outrage. Outrage was able to do significant damage to Luke`s Golett and it knocked it out which eliminated Luke from the tournament.
In the finals, Iris battled against Ash and though it was a close battle, Iris`s Excadrill had the type advantage against Pikachu and she won the tournament. For winning, Iris received the beautiful seven-feather "Top-Class Driftveil Wing Set," containing Health, Muscle, Resist, Genius, Clever, Swift, and Pretty Wings which she sent to Dragon Village via Pidove Shipping Service.
Day Care Monozu
In BW58, befriended a shy and lonely Monozu that was awaiting its Trainer to return. As Monozu`s are a Dragon Type Pokémon, Iris was instantly excited to spend time with it. It took her awhile to gain its trust though. Iris recalled an event to Monozu that she witnessed in the Dragon Village where she saw Elder befriend a Crimgan that got lost and somehow found its way into the Village. The Crimgan absolutely refused to get along with other Dragon types and the people of the Village. For days and days, the Crimgan wouldn`t come out from deep within the cave. The Elder waited for Crimgan at the entrance of the cave the whole time and she tried to make the Crimgan open its heart to her, by talking to it like the way Iris was talking to Monozu to gain its trust and friendship. After several days had passed, Crimgan came out of the cave. All the Elder had done was talk to it and still, she managed to free it from its insecurities.
Iris uses the same technique that Elder used and the shy Monozu became more open with Iris and the two of them became friends. Iris spent a few days with the Monozu as they awaited the Trainer to return. At one point, Iris suggested to the Monozu if its Trainer didn`t return that it could come with her. The Trainer did return though and Monozu left with it but not before it gave Iris its biggest smile.
Fukiyose Tower Bell of Wishes Festival
Stephan met up with Iris and her friends and informed them of the Fukiyose Tower Bell of Wishes Festival that he was going to participate in. After hearing from him that it was an awesome event held once a year at the Fukiyose Tower, Iris and her friends decided to enter the tournament with Stephan.
Iris and Iris`s Axew paired up for the tournament. In the scavenger hunt, Iris asked Cilan to lent her his fishing rod so she could advance to the next round. In the tub race, Iris`s Axew used Dragon Rage on the surface of the water to propel them to the next round. During the imitation competition, iris was forced to dress-up as Professor Juniper and Miles thought she did quite well and he advanced her to the next round. In the forest of trials, Iris thought she had won but Chandela`s Confuse Ray affected her and she was in the middle of the forest for the entire race and was therefore eliminated from the tournament.
Rematch Battle against Drayden at the Soryu Gym
Having accepted the challenge to battle at the Dragon Village, Iris met up with Drayden to have a rematch battle. He heard about Iris getting into trouble again by climbing the Soryu Tower but told here to eat something and have a rest while he had a school meeting and then they would have their battle.
During the battle, Drayden was evaluating how much Iris had grown and he noticed that Iris`s Excadrill power certainly seemed to have improved. The matchup between Iris`s Excadrill and Drayden`s Haxorus ended up in a draw as the two of them knocked each other out. In the matchup between, Drayden`s Druddigon and Iris` Dragonite, Drayden noted that Iris` Dragonite had had an interesting life during its past. Iris` Dragonite wanted to fight under the same conditions as Drayden`s Druddigon, who cannot fly. Everyone thought that Iris was doing well in the battle but Drayden`s Druddigon proved to be more powerful than they had anticipated. Drayden`s Druddigon knocked out Iris` Dragonite with a powerful Dragon Tail attack to give Drayden the victory in the rematch battle. Cilan thought Iris had cornered him, but Drayden was still a few steps ahead. Drayden was trying to get a clear picture of Iris by drawing out their power.
Drayden complemented Iris on making good friends and he realized that sending her off on a journey was the right thing to do. He could tell that she had grown up but standing still wasn`t good for her. He told her to strengthen herself even further, become stronger and grow and then visit him again.</description>

<description>Axew, known as the Tusk Pokémon. It is a bipedal, greenish-colored Pokémon with noticeable nostrils and pale tusks protruding from the sides of its mouth. It was described by IGN as a "baby parasaurolophus". It leaves gashes on trees and shrubs with its tusks in order to mark its territory and is capable of immediately regrowing broken tusks.
In the Pokémon anime, Iris owns an Axew, which was introduced in "Enter Iris and Axew!". She carries it in her extensive hair, rather than in a Poké Ball (similar to Ash`s Pikachu).
Game Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava stated "I kind of dig Axew", saying he looks "pretty cute", and "his stance says he`s ready for anything".</description>

<description>Snivy, known as the Grass Snake Pokémon, is one of the starter Pokémon in the Pokémon Black and White versions. Its arms and tails are similar to a palmate tree with three prongs, respectively. A Snivy uses its tail to process photosynthesis, and if it loses energy, its tail sags gradually. When charged up with sun`s energy, its movement speed sharpens. Snivy is known to behave accordingly in situations. In an interview with Ken Sugimori, he explained that Snivy was based on snakes that look like vines, and would have an aristocrat-like personality. He also stated that Snivy`s evolution would be Western style of design.
It was first revealed as a silhouette on the May 9, 2010, episode of Pokémon Sunday. In the anime, Snivy was first seen in "In the Shadow of Zekrom" as the starter Pokémon of Trip, a beginner trainer in the Unova region. In "Snivy Plays Hard to Catch", Ash Ketchum also encounters a female Snivy and successfully captures her. Snivy is also featured along with the other starter Pokémon in the Pokémon Adventures manga as one of the starters in Professor Juniper`s lab. Snivy is Monta`s starter Pokémon in the Pokémon Master Black &amp; White manga.
In a poll by Official Nintendo Magazine, it was voted as the most popular of the Starter Pokémon from Pokémon Black and White. As such, it has been nicknamed "Smugleaf" by fans and has quickly become an internet meme. GamesRadar`s Gudmundson called it "arguably the coolest-looking starter of the three." Gudmundson later noted its quality as a grass Pokémon due to a healthy movepool of grass-type moves. IGN`s Audrey Drake and Rich George chose Snivy as their starting Pokémon; Drake chose it "because he`s a little badass" and due to it being the most challenging, while George described him as "mischievous". Drake found its final form`s lack of arms to be weird, while George called it an "awesome demon snake." Fellow IGN editor Sam Claiborn described Snivy as an "abomination."</description>

<description>Cilan is a gym leader of Sanyo City Gym where he shares the responsibility with Chili and Cress. He is also a Pokémon Sommelier who, with his abundance of knowledge and experience, determines the compatibility of Trainers and Pokémon and gives them advice on how to befriend each other. Cilan specializes in Grass type Pokémon and his main Pokémon and partner is Yanappu. Cilan revealed during BW19 that he had passed the required exams of the Pokémon Sommelier association to become a certified A-class Sommelier who is able to make compatibility diagnoses.
Cilan has many female fans who flock to his presence though he puts off their advances almost immediately.

It`s Dent Time! - Dent`s Catch Phrases
Dent in the Japanese original has various phrases that are based off his original "It`s Tasting Time!" catch phrase. It`s generally modified in the episode to match what`s going on in that particular instance. Below is a list of these catch phrases.
It`s Cilan Time! - Cilan`s Catch Phrases
Cilan in the English Dub has various phrases that are based off Dent`s original "It`s Tasting Time!" catch phrase. Some of them are exclusive to the English dub.
Rival Cabernet
Burgundy is Pokémon Sommelière and a Pokémon Trainer who upon passing the C-class Sommelier test, decided to challenge Cilan at the Sanyo Gym for the Tri Badge. Cilan defeated her but when Burgundy returned to challenge Cilan at the gym, Chili and Cress had to explain that Cilan was on a journey and was no longer at the gym. Angry that Cilan was not the gym leader when she visited, she battled at the gym anyhow and won the Tri Badge.
Cilan encountered her at a Friendly Shop while on his way to Hiun City and she was now out for revenge. Burgundy challenged Cilan to a revenge battle where she ended up losing to him yet again. More angry than ever, she vowed to defeat Cilan the next time they met while working to become an S-class Sommelière and she took off.
Fishing Sommelier
In BW26, Cilan stated that he was a Fishing Sommelier. He was able to help Bianca learn how to fish better by showing her how to select a good fishing rod and then the two basic forms of casting techniques: the overhead cast and the side hand cast. Cilan also showed her the proper lure techniques by spinning the reel slowly and not rushing to attempt to catch the Water Pokémon. He has his own fishing rod that is collapsible and easy to carry. Cilan proved his Fishing Sommelier were quite good by catching a large Bassrao at the Fishing Tournament.Cilan`s Stunfisk was also captured by using his fishing skills.
Science Sommelier
In BW33, Cilan explained that he is not only a Pokémon Sommelier but also a Science Sommelier. A Science Sommelier is someone who tries to solve any kind of supernatural phenomenon by finding out the cause scientifically by collecting evidence and proving their theory. Cilan has always tried to solve mysterious problems scientifically like the poltergeist that he and his friends encountered at the Shippo Museum in BW14 which turned out to be a Deathmas.
Movie Sommelier
In BW40, Cilan announced that he as a Movie Sommelier, someone that is able to review, critique and analyze the different elements of a movie and its characters. Cilan specifically showed his knowledge as a Movie Sommelier when he was helping out with Luke`s movie "Legend of the Pokémon Knight" by making suggestions and improvising on the go. He also helped out Ash who was a bit nervous being in front of the camera and he talked about the famous movie, "The Mask of Deathmas", where the heroine is portrayed as putting her life on the line for the sake of acting. He told Ash that in order to move the viewers with his performance, he`d need to become the role he was assigned.
Metro Sommelier
While heading down to the underground railway in Raimon City, Cilan professed that he was also a Metro Sommelier. Metro Sommeliers are divided into a "car group", which is particular about the cars or into a "line group", which is particular about the lines. Cilan said he belonged to the car group. being a metro sommelier is basically joining a fan club for people that metro transit. Cilan met Subway Boss Ingo and Subway Boss Emmet at the previous years subway convention. Cilan`s knowledge came in quite handy when he had to drive the rail carriage to catch up to Team Rocket.
In BW53, Cilan used his skills as a Metro Sommelier to help him complete the subway station stamp rally so he could battle against Subway Boss Ingo and Subway Boss Emmet. Cilan had been dreaming of doing the rally for many years so he could battle them as its considered a great honor for Metro Sommelier`s. Cilan was also able to use his knowledge and skills as a Metro Sommelier to reunite Erina with her Kibago.
Trial Sommelier
While in Astilbe Town, Ash`s Tepig original owner Shamus was put on trial by Cilan after he revealed that he was a Trial Sommelier. He presented himself as an impartial courtroom judge in the Karakusa Town Pokabu Abandonment case where Prosecutor Ash told about the cruel abandonment of Ash`s Tepig where it had a rope tied up around its mouth. The defendant Shamus told a different story though as he said that forcing a talentless Pokémon into futile battles is crueler. Unable to make a decision in the case, Don George suggested that the verdict be decided with a battle and Cilan agreed. After Ash`s Pignite defeated Shamus, Cilan said the battle had a superb taste and that there`s no need to hand down a verdict as it`s obvious that Ash and Ash`s Tepig were right.
Gym Battle against Skyla
After watching Skyla perform `air battles` which were her determining how a battle would go against her gym challengers by simulating the battle in her head, Cilan got very upset that she was not actually doing the battles and he challenged her to a battle. Cilan agreed to do an `air battle` with her and she determined that he would loose the battle against her with the Pokémon he had chosen to battle her with. Cilan though wanted to have a real battle with her a he explained to her that with Pokémon battle, like any meal, must be tasted first before people can be certain to know anything. Skyla agreed and Cilan thought that he would be able to show her up by defeating her in a real battle and showing how her `air battles` are flawed. Unfortunately Cilan ended up loosing to Skyla but Ash challenged her to a battle right after.
Fukiyose Tower Bell of Wishes Festival
Stephan met up with Cilan and his friends and informed them of the Fukiyose Tower Bell of Wishes Festival that he was going to participate in. After hearing from him that it was an awesome event held once a year at the Fukiyose Tower, Cilan and his friends decided to enter the tournament with Stephan.
During the quiz, Cilan didn`t know how they`d be able to answer the question about who Miles liked better as it was a very subjectional question. Miles was going to pick Nurse Joy (Isshu) as the girl he preferred the most but Cilan seemed to notice Ricky`s Elgyem use its abilities to affect Miles but didn`t say anything as they were able to successfully get the question right and move on to the next round.
In the scavenger hunt, Cilan successfully managed to find a Miracle Shooter while he lent his fishing rod to Iris. In the tub race, Cilan`s Pansage on instruction from Cilan, paddled in the water the same way it used Dig to advance them to the next round. During the imitation competition, Cilan was forced to dress as Elesa and Cilan`s Pansage was forced to dress-up as Elesa`s Emolga. Everyone thought Cilan did an amazing job but Miles informed Cilan that he was a very big Elesa fan and he had to be very strict with imitations of her. Cilan was then eliminated from the tournament.
Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup
Cilan participated in the Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup at the Kagome Town stadium. In the first round he was in the third match and faced off against Shepherd. The match was quickly showcased and Cilan won the battle and advanced to the second round while Shepherd was eliminated from the tournament.</description>

<description>Tepig is a Fire Pig Pokémon that resembles a pig and is one of the starter Pokémon for Pokémon Black and White versions. When hungry, it uses its flame to cook for its food. It blows fire from its nostrils, but this is replaced with smoke when it catches a cold. In an interview with Ken Sugimori, he stated that Tepig`s evolution would be Chinese style of design. Tepig`s original Japanese name is a portmanteau of "Pokapoka", a Japanese word that refers to the warm feeling that circulates repeatedly throughout a body, and "Buu", which refers to a pig`s sound.Tepig was the third Pokémon that Ash Ketchum caught in the Unova region. In the english version, he was voiced by Marc Thompson.
In the anime, Tepig was first seen in In the Shadow of Zekrom!, under the ownership of Professor Juniper, as one of the starter Pokémon to be chosen by Trip. One later appears as an unfortunate Pokémon that was left behind by its trainer in Battle Club, after being defeated in a challenge. Ash Ketchum befriended the Pokémon and captured it afterward. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Tepig, along with Oshawott and Snivy appear when Black accidentally drops his box containing the Pokémon. The Tepig eventually joins his team and is named "Poka", which is short for Tepig`s Japanese name, Pokabu. Tepig is Cheren`s starter Pokémon in the Pokémon Master Black &amp; White manga series.
The Escapist criticized Tepig`s evolution line for being another Fire/Fighting type starter. Game Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava criticized its name for possibly being a pun of "tepid", which means lukewarm. GamesRadar`s Carolyn Gudmundson criticized its evolutionary line; while she enjoyed the first form`s design, she felt that the final form was a disappointment, as well as the use of a combination of fire and fighting as its type, a type combination used for the last three fire starters. IGN`s Sam Claiborn chose Tepig as his starting Pokémon due to its final form which he described as a "bipedal pig demon".</description>

<description>Oshawott, known as the Sea Otter Pokémon, has a shell on its belly made of the same components as fingernails. It can detach the shell from its body and use it as a blade. Oshawott appears in Pokémon Black and White, where it is first available as a Starter Pokémon for players to choose from alongside Snivy and Tepig. After gaining enough experience in battle, Oshawott evolves into Dewott, and then into Samurott.</description>

<description>Pansage is known as the Grass Monkey Pokémon. It is part of a trio that seems to be inspired by the three wise monkeys motif; with its mouth open, Pansage represents "speak no evil". Pansage lives in thick forests, and shares the leaves on its head with exhausted Pokémon. They have the effect of relieving from fatigue.
In the anime, Cilan owns a Pansage that first appeared along with Pansear and Panpour owned by Chili and Cress respectively. In the Pocket Monsters BW manga, Cilan uses a Pansage against Isamu Akai`s Clefairy in issue 3 when he tries to instigate a fight between Cilan, Chili, and Cress. In the Pokémon Master Black &amp; White manga, Cheren uses a Pansage against Monta in a triple battle.
Game Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava stated that its ability, Gluttony, "almost makes up for the broccoli growing out of its head". GamesRadar`s Carolyn Gudmundson commented that it was the most appealing of the three monkeys, design-wise. She also compared it to Eevee and its evolutions, due to each one being of a different type: grass, fire, and water.</description>

<description>Joy is the name for every member of an identical family of Pokémon nurses. They mainly work in Pokémon Centers, but they also work in other locations. They are also often accompanied by a Chansey or Blissey. Like Chansey and Blissey, all Nurse Joys are mostly hospitable, especially towards Pokémon. Brock, who claims to be able to tell the Joys just by minor appearance details (different-colored crosses on their hats; hair is slightly shorter; smile is wider; etc.), is infatuated with every Nurse Joy he meets, and often has to be restrained by a traveling companion. Although all of them look completely identical to each other, some do have different personalities, and a few even other occupations besides nursing. There is a Nurse Joy who is a body builder, a contest judge and even one who is scared of water Pokémon. In the Pokémon Diamond and Pearl series, there was also a Nurse Joy who is married and has two daughters who both have the name "Joy" at the end of their names and looks exactly like their mother rather than their father. Pokémon: The Electric Tale of Pikachu manga author Toshihiro Ono cited her as one of his favorite characters to draw for the series, stating the reason as "because she`s a girl".</description>

<description>Servine, a Grass Snake Pokémon, is the evolution of Snivy. Servine resembles a grass snake, and its appearance is very similar to Snivy except its back is grown by three palmate leaves with three prongs each. During a battle, it can run as if gliding from the ground that may bewilder its enemies. It evades attack by passing overgrown plants and then whipping the foe quickly.
In the anime, a Servine is first seen battling against a Dewott in one of the Battle Clubs in the Unova region. Trip`s Snivy was revealed to have evolved into a Servine some time before Trip`s second battle against Ash Ketchum.</description>

In a poll by Official Nintendo Magazine, Serperior was voted as one of the best Pokémon from Black and White. Editor Thomas East stated that "not many people would dispute that choosing Snivy as a Starter is all worth it in the end for its awesome final evolution.".</description>

Multiple Patrat made a brief cameo in Black and White episode 3 with multiple Pidove and Deerling where they needed help from Ash and his friends. In the Pokémon Master Black &amp; White manga, Monta captures a Patrat in the first chapter.
Patrat and its evolution Watchog were called "fairly unremarkable aside from their intense facial expressions" by GamesRadar`s Carolyn Gudmundson. Gudmundson later noted it as a "Bidoof analog", in spite of the fact that it can only learn one Hidden Machine, whereas Bidoof can learn many. She adds that it is very easy to become bored of it. Official Nintendo Magazine`s Chris Schilling commented that Patrat was the "new Bidoof".</description>

<description>Woobat, known as the Bat Pokémon, is a white, shaggy creature based upon the Honduran white bat. It has a piggish, large nose with a nostril in the shape of a heart. Its eyes are hidden behind two shaggy tufts of fur. It has a large mouth with a single fang, and two relatively small wings on either side of it. It lives in dark forests and caves. It explores its surroundings by releasing ultrasonic waves from its nostrils. It sleeps stuck on the walls of caves by its nostrils. It leaves heart marks on the places where it was stuck.
Woobat`s first appearance in the video games is in the two games Pokémon Black and White as a common Pokémon found in the wild. It eventually evolves into the Pokémon Swoobat by leveling up when its happiness is high. Happiness can be raised by fighting through many Pokémon battles. In the games, it was described as Black and White`s version of the Pokémon Zubat due to being of a similar species Woobat also appears in the Pokémon spin-off game Battle &amp; Get! Pokémon Typing DS where players type in the names of Pokémon that they see. In the anime, Jessie catches a Woobat while in a cave with James and Meowth. She uses it to battle against Ash and Iris. It manages to defeat Ash`s newly captured Pidove but is defeated by Oshawott`s Water Gun. Woobat has made other minor appearances in the anime. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, a Woobat is in the possession of the character White.
IGN described it as the baby of "a Tribble, a bat, and a pig". Game Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava stated "I kind of like the idea of having a romantic bat as a Pokémon... However, I`m not sold on its abilities". Jeremy Parish of Retronauts criticized the series` use of redundant new Pokémon, commenting that Woobat was the same as Zubat, referencing the uncanny similarities in name. IGN`s Jack DeVries questioned whether Woobat would act as a Zubat replacement. He later expressed that despite being unsure of Woobat`s quality, he wrote that "at least he`s not a Zubat". 1UP.com`s Kat Bailey wrote that Woobat was basically a Zubat with a pig`s snout. 1UP.com`s Michael Vreeland wrote that Woobat was "a lot more interesting" than Zubat. G4TV`s Nikole Zivalich, however wrote that Woobat was derivative and inferior to Zubat and that while fans will appreciate not having to run into so many Zubats, the "alternative isn`t much better". Carolyn Gudmundson of GamesRadar similarly described Woobat as the "new Zubat", noting that based on their looks, it and its evolution are two of their favourite Pokémon; however, they do note that they have some faults gameplay-wise.</description>

<description>Darumaka is a Fire-type Pokémon introduced in Generation V.
It evolves into Darmanitan starting at level 35.
In Galar, Darumaka has an Ice-type regional form. It evolves into Galarian Darmanitan when exposed to an Ice Stone.
Darumaka is a round, red Pokémon with an orange face and yellow curly eyebrows. It has three yellow ovals on its abdomen and a curvy yellow line on its back. Its paws are orange and have three digits each. It has very warm droppings, which ancient people put in their clothes to keep themselves warm.
When the flame inside its body burns, Darumaka is very active. It cannot calm down in this state, and thus becomes uncontrollable. As the flame shrinks, it falls asleep. It can tuck in its arms and legs when it rests; during that time, it slightly sways. While it is sleeping, it cannot be tipped over no matter how much it is pushed or pulled, like a tumbler doll, which it resembles in this state. It prefers to live in a desert environment.
Galarian Darumaka has a thicker coat than normal Darumaka, several turquoise ice crystals as its eyebrows and on its chest, and has blue hands and face with white snowy fur. Unlike its normal form, Galarian Darumaka has a timid frown instead of a mischievous smile.
Seismic shift in the Galar region long ago caused the warm climate to cool, and Darumaka in this region have adapted to this cooling. The fire that burned within their bodies went out, leaving an organ that produces cold air instead. The colder Darumaka gets, the more energetic it becomes. They can focus their internal energy to breathe out cold air in the form of snow, which they use to make snowballs for ammo in playful snowball fights with each other. Galarian Darumaka enjoys eating Berries produced by Snover. This leads it to prey on Snover often being driven off by Abomasnow.</description>

<description>Yamask is a Ghost-type Pokémon introduced in Generation V.
It evolves into Cofagrigus starting at level 34.
In Galar, Yamask has a Ground/Ghost-type regional form. It evolves into Runerigus when the player travels under the stone bridge in Dusty Bowl after Yamask has lost at least 49 HP from attacks and did not faint in the same battle or since.
Yamask is a shadow-like Pokémon holding a mask that has a face from its time as a human. It has two shadowy, tendril-like arms and large, red eyes. It also has a small tail-like appendage that holds the mask. Yamask is capable of speech when possessing a human, but not in its regular form.
Due to being a human long ago, it has memories of being a human. If someone wears the mask Yamask carries, they will become possessed by the Yamask in question. Sometimes, it looks at this mask and cries, apparently in longing. Yamask is known to wander the ruins of ancient civilizations.
The Yamask of Galar have purple eyes and a small piece of an ancient stone tablet is directly attached to its tail. The tablet bears cursed engravings, and is said to be absorbing Yamask`s dark power.</description>

<description>Trubbish is known as the Trash Bag Pokémon. It is said that a trash bag that is thrown away chemically reacted with waste to become this Pokémon. It likes dirty places such as waste deposits.
Despite finding Black and White`s Pokémon to be well-designed, IGN`s Audrey Drake found Trubbish and its evolution to be contrary to this. IGN AU`s Cam Shea mocked it, jokingly stating that nothing was cuter than an "anthropomorphic bag of garbage"; he jokingly suggested that they make similar Pokémon called "Mediwastical" and "Stinkydiaperino".</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Iris`s Axew was first seen appearing out of Iris`s large hairdo, much to the surprise of Ash and Pikachu. Ash helped rescue Axew from Team Rocket when they captured it just after Iris met Ash.
Axew is Iris`s main Pokémon and it doesn`t seem to like to travel in its monster ball. It seems to prefer traveling on Iris`s shoulders and in her hair.
Mastering Dragon Rage
Iris had been practicing Dragon Rage with her Kibago for quite a while and every time the attack was used it was unsuccessful and created a crater in the ground where the attack was used and injured everyone in the area. After being captured by Team Rocket along with Crimgan, Iris`s Axew managed to master Dragon Rage which was powerful enough to crash their flying transport mecha. In the battle encounter with Team Rocket that occurred after the crash, Iris`s Axew showed everyone that it had finally mastered the move by launching a successful attack at Team Rocket but they managed to escape before it hit them.
Don Battles Against Luke`s Golett
Iris`s Axew and Luke`s Golett were matched up in the semi-final round of the Don Battles in Raimon Town. Luke`s Golett dominated most of the battle and just as Iris`s Axew was about to be defeated, it learned the move Outrage. Outrage was able to do significant damage to Luke`s Golett and it knocked it out which eliminated Luke from the tournament.
Battle against Cynthia`s Garchomp / Learning Giga Impact
Iris asked to battle Cynthia`s Garchomp with her Kibago as she was working on becoming a Dragon Master. Even before it the started, the battled seemed like Cynthia`s Garchomp would win. Iris`s Axew could not do any damage to Cynthia`s Garchomp until it finally concentrated for a few moments and learned Giga Impact. While Giga Impact was able to do some damage to Cynthia`s Garchomp, it quickly overpowered Iris`s Axew until Cynthia decided to end the match before a finishing blow.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Ash first encountered Mijumaru at Professor Juniper laboratory as it was one of the Pokémon that Trip was to choose from. Ash called it cute when he first saw it which caused Mijumaru to blush a bit. After being shocked that it wasn`t chosen by Trip, it followed Ash and Pikachu as they started their journey in the Isshu region.
It rescued Pikachu and Iris`s Axew from Rocket Gang. Ash thanked it but quickly left it behind in the forest so that he could treat Pikachu. It continued following Ash until one day it met up again and tried to explain that it wanted to join Ash on his journey. Ash tried to capture it with one of his Poké balls but then realized it already had a Poké ball and that this Mijumaru must have been the same one that he met at Professor Juniper lab. He contacted Professor Juniper and she agreed to let him have the Mijumaru and transferred its Poké ball to him. By the time it had been transferred over, it had disappeared again.
Ash met up with Mijumaru once again when they were resting in the sands at Dan`s hotel. After protecting Ash from being scalded from a hot water geyser, Ash quickly recalled it into the Poké ball before it got scalded itself. Since then Ash`s Oshawott has had the tendency to come out of its Poké ball whenever it feels like despite what the current situation is.
Gym Battles against Lenora`s Watchog
During the first gym battle against Ash`s Oshawott, Lenora`s Watchog used Mean Look so Ash`s Oshawott couldn`t be switched out. Since Ash`s Oshawott wasn`t expecting to battle Lenora`s Watchog at that time, it was at a disadvantage and it was in a bad mood. After Ash`s Oshawott lost its shell during the battle, Lenora`s Watchog was able to use its Thunderbolt effectively to knock Ash`s Oshawott out of the match.
During the rematch battle against Lenora`s Watchog, Ash`s Oshawott had learned Aqua Jet during the time between the two battle and but its accuracy make it easy for Lenora`s Watchog to avoid it. Though through sheer luck, Ash`s Oshawott Aqua Jet managed to hit Lenora`s Watchog and both ended up getting knocked out at the same time as Lenora`s Watchog used Thunderbolt just before it got hit.
Three-on-Three Battle Against Trip`s Timburr
Ash`s Oshawott was paired up against Trip`s Timburr but the beginning of the battle didn`t go to well for Ash as Ash`s Oshawott had its eyes closed during Aqua Jet and completely missed hitting Trip`s Timburr. After a short break in the battle, the two finished up with their final attacks. Ash`s Oshawott`s Razor Shell proved to be stronger than Trip`s Timburr`s DynamicPunch and Ash`s Oshawott defeated Trip`s Timburr despite its initial problems with Aqua Jet`s accuracy.
Mastering Aqua Jet
While training in Don George`s pool for the battle against Lenora, Ash`s Oshawott learned Aqua Jet. It`s aim proved to be quite off but through sheer luck it was able to use Aqua Jet to knock out both Lenora`s Watchog and Stephan`s Blitzle. It wasn`t until Trip noticed by taking some pictures during his three-on-three battle with Ash that Ash`s Oshawott had its eyes closed during Aqua Jet. Ash vowed to help his Oshawott practice to keep its eyes open underwater so that its Aqua Jet`s targeting would be accurate.
While enroute to Raimon City, Ash, Iris and Cilan`s Pokémon all got poisoned and the only thing that could cure them was a waterweed plant found in a nearby lake. Ash`s Oshawott was training with Ash at the time and didn`t get poisoned and since it was a Water Pokémon, it was best suited for the job. Unfortunately Ash`s Oshawott still didn`t like to open its eyes underwater until it was forced to defend itself against a school of Tympole who were protecting their lake from trespassers. Ash`s Oshawott opened its eyes underwater to defend itself and it started to get comfortable doing so. Ash`s Oshawott was later forced to battle Palpitoad because it came out of the water to protect its lake. During the battle, Ash`s Oshawott managed to master its Aqua Jet as it was able to remember the battle against the Tympole school and how having its eyes opened underwater was quite effective and that proved to be the decisive factor in the battle as Palpitoad was knocked out and Ash caught it.
Battle against Bel`s Father`s Hihidaruma
Ash challenged Bianca`s Father to a Pokémon battle to allow Bianca to continue to travel. He agreed but changed the challenge to force Ash to return home to Pallet Town if he lost the battle. Ash`s Oshawott came out of its ball as it wanted to battle against Bianca`s Father`s Darmanitan and Ash thought that it would be okay because it had a type advantage being a water Pokémon. Even though Bianca`s Father`s Darmanitan only used Fire type moves throughout the battle, it proved to be too strong for Ash`s Oshawott. Ash`s Oshawott did manage to land an Aqua Jet. Bianca`s Father commented though that his Red Flash Hihidaruma gets more fired up the more resistance it faces and shortly after it knocked Ash`s Oshawott out. Despite loosing the battle, Bianca`s Father changed his mind because the battle with Ash and his Mijumaru made him remember the joy of traveling.
Battle Against Pod`s Baoppu
Initially, Ash was going to battle Chili`s Pansear with his Pikachu, but Ash`s Oshawott popped out and wanted to battle it instead. Ash agreed and despite the type disadvantage in this battle, Chili just got more fired up. Chili`s Pansear managed to cover its weakness with power and momentum and taking Cilan`s advice into account, it used Flame Charge to increase its speed to become useful when dodging Ash`s Oshawott moves. Chili`s Pansear managed to endure Ash`s Oshawott super effective moves just long enough for it to use its newly learned SolarBeam attack which Ash`s Oshawott was unable to dodge and it was knocked out. Chili`s Pansear won the battle despite the type disadvantage.
Battle Against Clay`s Krokorok
Clay`s Krokorok was the first Pokémon Clay used to battle against Ash during his gym battle. Clay`s Krokorok was paired up against Ash`s Oshawott as Pikachu initially wanted to battle it but Ash realized that an Electric type against a Ground type would be a bad idea.
At the beginning of the battle, Clay`s Krokorok had the upper hand as its Sandstorm managed to get sand in Ash`s Oshawott`s eyes and it also made it harder for Ash`s Oshawott to accurately attack. Clay`s Krokorok managed to hit Ash`s Oshawott with a Bite and a Stone Edge attack but it wasn`t enough to knock it out. Ash`s Oshawott used Water Gun to clear up the Sandstorm and then it began its counterattack. Clay`s Krokorok was repetitively hit with multiple attacks from Ash`s Oshawott including a super effective Aqua Jet and Razor Shell combo that ended up being too much for it and it was knocked out.
Battle Against Clay`s Palpitoad
Ash decided to keep his Oshawott out to battle against Clay`s Palpitoad and right away it became evident that Clay`s Palpitoad was the stronger Pokémon as its Hydro Pump ended up being more powerful than Ash`s Oshawott Water Gun. Clay`s Palpitoad followed up with a Sludge Bomb that knocked Ash`s Oshawott`s scallsword out of its hand and just as it was retrieving it, it got hit by Clay`s Palpitoad Rock Smash`s and was knocked out.
Ash`s Oshawott and Dawn`s Piplup Rivalry
Ash`s Oshawott and Dawn`s Piplup both fell in love with Meloetta and the two of them began a rivalry to win the affection of Meloetta. Ash`s Oshawott would often come out of its PokéBall when it could tell that Dawn`s Piplup was trying to take advantage of a situation. Even though the two of them often argued, they found a common ground and became friends after Meloetta left.</description>

Yanappu battled against Ash`s Oshawott during his gym battle. Cilan`s Pansage showed its speed by being able to dodge most of Mijumaru Water Gun attacks.
Battle Against Pod`s Baoppu
Chili wanted to see the results of Cilan`s studying and he challenged him to a battle. Chili thought that it would be an easy battle as they had the super effective type advantage but as the battle progressed Chili didn`t like the fact that Cilan`s Pansage kept avoiding all of Chili`s Pansear fire attacks and Chili told Cilan that running away all the time doesn`t make a battle. Cilan though told him that running away is a perfectly fine way to battle. Chili got more angry during the battle and after loosing he blamed his Baoppu for the loss as it missed its Fire Blast at the most crucial moment. Chili`s Pansear ran away in anger as it was mad it was getting blamed for the loss and Cilan then blamed Chili for the loss in the battle which only fueled Chili`s anger and he ran off as well.
Battle against Skyla
Skyla`s Unfezant was matched up against Cilan`s Pansage in Skyla`s air battle and she believed that her Unfezant would be victorious. In the actual gym battle, Skyla`s Swoobat was matched up against Cilan`s Pansage. It proved to be very fast in the air and easily dodged all of Cilan`s Pansage`s attacks. It only used two attacks against Cilan`s Pansage: a Air Cutter and a Gust attack before it knocked it out and gave Skyla the victory in the first round.
Tag Battle against Soran`s Warrgle and Riiku`s Mogurew
Cilan`s Pansage had a tag battle with Ash`s Unfezant against Soran`s Warrgle and Riiku`s Mogurew while Ash and his friends were on their way to Higaki City where the Isshu League was to be held. Soran`s Warrgle and Riiku`s Mogurew used special move combinations which proved to be effective in the tag battle against Ash and Cilan until they also decided to use their own combination of moves which ended up overpowering Soran`s Warrgle and Riiku`s Mogurew and they lost the tag battle.</description>

<description>While on route to Shippo City, Ash encountered a resilient Tsutarja. Tsutarja started eating the cakes Dent made. Realizing that it was a strong and powerful Pokémon, he decided to try to capture it right away but it didn`t get captured in the monster ball. Ash then instructed Pikachu to attack Tsutarja but Ash ended up having to protect Pikachu from Tsutarja`s powerful vine whips as it was exposed to Attract which made it dizzy.
Ash`s Oshawott and Ash`s Tepig were both sent out to battle Tsutarja as well but it used Attract against them which proved quite effective due to the gender differences. Ash finally instructed his Mamepato to battle as it wasn`t affected by Attract. After a fierce battle between Tsutarja and Mamepato, Tsutarja was weakened enough and Ash captured it successfully.
Don George Tournament
Georgia faced Ash in the second round of the Don George tournament in Raimon Town. Georgia`s Pawniard faced Ash`s Snivy and at the beginning of the battle it looked like it was going to easily win but Ash`s Snivy was able to avoid getting hit by Guillotine. From that point on, Ash`s Snivy took control of the match and was able to defeat Georgia`s Pawniard which advanced Ash on to the next round in the tournament.
Gym Battle Against Elesa`s Emolga
After Elesa`s Emolga defeated Ash`s Palpitoad, Ash`s Snivy was sent out to battle against Elesa`s Emolga but Ash didn`t really have a battle strategy anymore since his Palpitoad had been defeated and he forgot that Emolga was also a Flying type. Elesa`s Emolga combination of Acrobatics and Aerial Ace was just too hard for Ash`s Snivy to defend against as the type advantage hampered it. Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy fairly easily.
Battle against Katharine`s Gothita
Katharine`s Gothita convinced Ash`s Scraggy to come with it outside to get something to eat. They ended up getting in trouble with a Garbodor and Katharine`s Deerling to use its Aromatherapy to calm down the raging Garbodor after Ash`s Snivy had followed them to see what they were up to. Katharine`s Gothita did not like the fact that Ash`s Snivy had been looking up on them and it decided it wanted to battle it.
Katharine`s Gothita was quite mad at Ash`s Snivy but it didn`t stand a chance against it in battle. Ash`s Snivy barely broke a sweat as it was able to counter and avoid all of Katharine`s Gothita`s attacks before it knocked it out with its Leaf Storm. Still upset, Katharine`s Gothita ran off into the distance.
Battle against Clay`s Palpitoad
After knocking out Ash`s Oshawott, Ash`s Snivy was sent out to replace it as Ash picked it because it was strong against both Ground and Water. Ash`s Snivy used Attract right at the beginning of their battle which prove to be an unexpected yet effective technique as Clay`s Palpitoad was unable to attack after the effects of Attract took hold of it. Ash`s Snivy pummeled Clay`s Palpitoad with effective Grass type attacks until it was knocked out.
Battle against Clay`s Excadrill
Ash kept his Snivy out to battle against Clay`s Excadrill but that matchup didn`t last long as Clay`s Excadrill was able to defend against all of Ash`s Snivy`s attacks. Ash`s Snivy was quickly knocked out with a strong Horn Drill.</description>

<description>Iris`s Excadrill was revealed when she was required to rescue her Axew from a raging Pendra. She called out Excadrill to help rescue Axew from between Pendra`s horns but it stayed in its curled up drill state until after Axew was rescued. Pendra though was still raging and it kicked Excadrill and got it angry. It then drilled underneath Pendra and then set it flying.
Excadrill didn`t always want to obey Iris when its asked to do something. For awhile, it was stubborn but Iris`s Excadrill was able to overcome the feelings of resentment and lost of trust it felt from the battle against Drayden`s Haxorus. After relating her experience to Ash and Cilan, it became more clear to Iris that she was not fully understanding her Excadrill`s feelings. Iris apologized to her Excadrill as she finally realized that her Excadrill knew after the first hit during the battle against Drayden`s Haxorus that they couldn`t win against it.
Battle against Drayden`s Haxorus at Dragon Village Battle Tournament
Having watched Iris`s Excadrill battle and defeat the Trainer`s Crimgan at the battle tournament in the Dragon Village, Drayden came out of the tent to meet Iris and her Excadrill. Iris challenged Drayden to a battle and if they won the battle, it would be their 100th victory together. Drayden accepted and sent out his Haxorus. Iris`s Excadrill was no match for Drayden`s Haxorus and it was defeated with a powerful Rock Smash attack. After the battle it began to distrust Iris and hid itself in its drilling position.
Mastering Focus Blast
Iris eventually realized that her Excadrill didn`t know any moves that it could use to fight with from a distance. She also realized that if it had known one at an earlier time, they would`ve had more options on how to construct our battles and would have been better prepared against Drayden`s Haxorus which had strong counter defenses against close range attacks. The night Iris apologized to her Excadrill, it decided to go out into the forest to practice working on Focus Blast. Iris showed up and the two of them practiced all through the night until it was finally able to successfully launch the attack.
Battles against Langley`s Beartic
After Iris`s Axew was defeated by Georgia`s Beartic, Iris was confident that her Excadrill was easily strong enough to defeat Georgia`s Beartic. She called her Excadrill out to battle but it appeared in its drilling position to which Iris told Georgia that it was in that position because it needed motivation. Georgia`s Beartic quickly attacked it with a Slash attack which was more than enough motivation for it to battle. Unfortunately, it wouldn`t listen to Iris`s commands and it ended up loosing the match when Georgia`s Beartic used Rock Smash, the same move that caused it to loose its first Pokémon battle and began secluding itself.
During the rematch battle, Iris`s Excadrill listened to Iris`s commands and they were able to have a more effective battle. Georgia`s Beartic still proved to be a powerful opponent but this time the battle ended in a draw.
Donamite Tournament
Burgundy`s Dewott entered the Donamite tournament and faced Iris`s Excadrill in the first round. Iris`s Excadrill was able to defend Burgundy`s Dewott new move Ice Beam with its claws but when Iris`s Excadrill dug a hole, Burgundy`s Dewott used Water Pulse in the hole to deal some significant damage and get it back above ground. Iris`s Excadrill fought back with another violent Metal Claw attack which struck its mark and looked like it had defeated Burgundy`s Dewott. Burgundy`s Dewott had another new move up its sleeve and it got up off the ground and used Revenge. Iris`s Excadrill managed to withstand Revenge and counterattack with Dig while Burgundy`s Dewott was still recovering. Iris`s Excadrill won the match and eliminated Burgundy from the tournament.
Rematch Battle against Drayden`s Haxorus at the Soryu Gym
During the battle, Drayden was evaluating how much Iris had grown and he noticed that Iris`s Excadrill power certainly seemed to have improved. The matchup between Iris`s Excadrill and Drayden`s Haxorus ended up in a draw as the two of them knocked each other out.</description>

It appears once more in "Rematch at the Nacrene Gym!", where it is defeated by Oshawott`s Aqua Jet.
Game Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava described Watchog as a "pissed-off meerkat", and further calling it a "disgruntled-looking jerk". An editor for GamesRadar included it in a satirical character battle between their "ultimate hated characters".</description>

<description>Garbodor is a Poison-type Pokémon introduced in Generation V.
It evolves from Trubbish starting at level 36. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Garbodor has the appearance of a pile of trash spilling out of a large, torn garbage bag. It has a round, lumpy body that is mostly tan with blue and pink lumps. Its head has the appearance of the tied end of a garbage bag that has been ripped open and trails down like a cape. It has two appendages that look like clumps of garbage coming from its head. Its large, round eyes have small pupils, and when it opens its mouth, its large, triangular teeth can be seen. Garbodor has two long arms made of garbage; one held together with piping, with fingers also made up of piping material, and the other held together with rebar. It has one finger on its left hand and three on the other. It also has flat, dumpy feet.
Garbodor is able to spray poisonous gas and filth from its fingertips, but only from its right hand. If that filth is blocked, its arm can swell up, causing it considerable pain and discomfort. It also finishes off opponents by subduing them with its left arm and spewing an awful-smelling toxic gas from its mouth. Garbodor prefers to live in unsanitary places such as garbage dumps. Garbodor inhales garbage, which then becomes part of its body. The toxic liquid from its right arm is so virulent, it can kill a weakened foe instantly. Alola was once home to many Garbodor, but the population shrank precipitously after Grimer was introduced to its habitat. This is said to have made the remaining Garbodor population stronger than its counterparts from other regions. Alolan Muk preys on Garbodor.
As Gigantamax Garboodor, its size has increased with an altered look. The sclera in its eyes are dark pink. The feet disappear, with the lumpy body expanding. Several discarded toys appear on Garboodor. The toys are as follows: toy car, blocks, toy airplane, toy cruise ship, Substitute doll, Poke Doll, Master Ball, fish skeleton, and toy train. The spikes on its shoulder becomes longer. The right arm becomes bulkier. There is dark blue, pink, and light green spots all across its body. Three red clouds float around the head.
When Gigantamaxing, its toxic gas becomes thicker. This result in the gas taking a solid shape of discarded toys. Gigantamax Garbodor releases the gas through its mouth and fingers. Should the gas engulf someone, the toxin will seep deep in the bones.
Gigantamax Garbodor is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Malodor.</description>

It has red eyes, dark blue body, and, unlike its earlier evolutions, possesses clawed, paddle-like arms with yellow spots and yellow-and-red palms. It has a beige fin on the upper portion of its body and beige fin-like legs below. It is also the final evolution of Tynamo. Eelektross and its evolutionary relatives are the only Pokémon to have no weaknesses other than Ghost/Dark. However, this is due to their Levitate ability, which eliminates what would be their sole weakness to the Ground type.</description>

<description>Stunfisk is a dual-type Ground/Electric Pokémon introduced in Generation V.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
In Galar, Stunfisk has a Ground/Steel-type regional form.
Stunfisk is a flat, fish-like Pokémon with a broad, mud-brown body. At the base of its yellow tail is a yellow marking shaped like an exclamation mark when seen from behind. It has small, horizontal, oval-shaped eyes, white with a tiny black pupil and no irises. Almost exactly between these two eyes lies the two thick gray lips that form its mouth. It has two small, flimsy fins at the sides of its body; each with two lobes. It has been seen to leap into the air and flap its fins as if they`re wings to remain airborne.
Stunfisk`s very tough skin keeps them unharmed if stepped on, even by sumo wrestlers. To exploit this, it buries itself in mud of the seashore and waits for prey to pass by. Whenever unsuspecting prey touch a Stunfisk`s body, it is zapped. Stunfisk smiles when electrocuting its foes. If it cannot paralyze its foe, it contorts itself with unexpected speed and flops away.
Galarian Stunfisk is grayish-brown, with three green markings similar to footprints on its body. It cannot generate electricity, but the high iron content of the mud it lives in has strengthened its fins, which have been adapted into an apparatus akin to a bear trap. Galarian Stunfisk leaves its red and white lips visible to lure in prey, and then slams its fins shut on them so they cannot escape. It is the only known Pokémon capable of using the move Snap Trap.</description>

Other facts such as its title as "Sun Pokémon", and the fact it dwells in-game within an abandoned sun temple in a desert, imply it is a solar deity akin to the Egyptian sun god Ra.
One can be found sealed off at the end of a deep maze in the Relic Castle after defeating Team Plasma and talking to one of the Seven Sages who was planning to capture it for his lord, Ghetsis. A Volcarona is used by Pokémon League Champion, Alder.

<description>Virizion is known as the Grassland Pokémon. It resembles an antelope. It is closely related to Cobalion and Terrakion. It can be found in a sealed off area of the Pinwheel Forest after winning the trust of Cobalion.
Legends say that it, along with Terrakion and Cobalion, fought for the rights of Pokémon against the humans that were abusing them.
Virizion is one of the members of the Sacred Swordsman and was one of the Pokémon that helped Keldeo learn the true weight of its sword to become part of the Sacred Swordsman. Virizion is awesome and is always keeping her cool. Amongst the Sacred Swordsman, she`s the smartest and the fastest Pokémon.
The English dub has an odd pronunciation of the legendary Pokémon Virizion (ビリジオン) and it makes it sound exactly the same as Verizon, a large telco in the United States. It`s unclear why they would want to make such a horrible pronunciation of the name to confuse it with a large companies name which is trademarked. The Japanese version of the movie does not pronounce it the same way and the English dub should have stayed consistent with its pronunciation.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kyurem is known as the Boundary Pokémon. It resembles a large bipedal gray dragon with various icy appendages. Kyurem has small arms, wings with two large claws (with the right wing noticeably shorter than the left), a long tail that ends in a fork, a head covered by ice with yellow eyes, and a very long, slender neck.
Kyurem is the strongest Dragon type Pokémon in the world. It was born at the same time as Zekrom and Reshiram.
It possesses the strongest genes and its body is constantly emitting a bitter chill. Kyurem lives in an abandoned mine up over the mountains near Roshan. It`s said to have never been seen leaving there until it chased after Keldeo. Kyurem is able to speak to humans.
Keldeo went to challenge Kyurem on its own despite not being able to use its sword yet and against the council of the Sacred Swordsman. During the battle against , Keldeo learned that it was still too weak to face Kyurem and it got its horn broken off and it fled because it was scared. Virizion, Terrakion and Cobalion came to rescue Keldeo but they were frozen in ice by Kyurem.
After falling on the train that Ash and his friends were traveling on, it befriended them and with their encouragement, Keldeo decided to face Kyurem once more. During that battle, Keldeo learned to use its sword properly and was able to prove to Kyurem that it was a strong Pokémon after all. Kyurem complemented Keldeo on a nice sword and putting the safety of its friends first before accepting that it won the battle against Keldeo. After Keldeo proved to be worthy to become a Sacred Swordsman, Virizion, Terrakion and Cobalion had no objections and agreed that Keldeo should join them.
A legend behind the Pokémon states that it came to Earth on an icy meteor from space. At night, it came to Lacunosa Town to terrorize and to eat its inhabitants, causing the residents of the town to lock their doors at night and never exit their house unless the sun is up. Another legend states that it is solely the living corpse of the ancient dragon that both Reshiram and Zekrom split from after its original owners had a conflict with each other on how to rule the Unova region.[49] In a poll conducted by IGN, it was voted as the 77th best Pokémon, where the staff commented on how its typing and stats make it "a formidable Pokémon".
Alternate forms of Kyurem were announced with the revealing of the new Pokémon Black Version 2 and White Version 2 games. On Junichi Masuda`s Twitter page they were formally called Black Kyurem and White Kyurem. Kyurem can change into these forms by using a special item to merge with either Reshiram or Zekrom.</description>

Most of its body is cream-colored, and it has a large, red mane, and a light blue, long tail. On its face there are long, dark blue, ridged eyebrow-like features, and a single horn. It has round dark blue hooves. In Black 2 and White 2, Keldeo a unique new form when it learns the move Secret Sword. Its default form is called Ordinary Form, but its new form is called Resolute Form, where dark blue features around its head merge around its horn, producing a much stronger dark blue horn.

During the war between humans and Pokémon, a fire started in the Moor of Icirrus. As a result, many Pokémon, including Keldeo, were left homeless. Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion acted as its parents, and taught it the necessary skills for survival. Eventually, Keldeo grew and surpassed the three Pokémon, and left the forest one day without anyone knowing why. Upon reuniting with the members of its quartet in its old home, they teach it Secret Sword.
Keldeo debuted in the fifteenth Pokémon film Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice, portrayed by voice actress and Pokémon fan Shoko Nakagawa. As a video game character, it was initially made available to those in Japan who saw the film in theaters. Its international release begins with distribution through GameStop stores in the United States and EB Games stores in Canada beginning on August 27, 2012, followed by distribution in the United Kingdom at Game and Gamestation stores on September 1, 2012, in Australia at EB Games Australia and Target Australia on September 15, and other nations throughout September and October.</description>

<description>Ash met Kikuyo who runs a Pokémon Day Care near Shippo City where she watches over Pokémon eggs. As thanks for helping out her granddaughter Yuri (Isshu) sort out her kindergarten class, she gave Ash a Pokémon egg. Kikuyo told Ash to raise it well so that it would be a great Pokémon. That Pokémon egg later hatched into Ash`s Zuruggu while Ash was en-route to Castelia City.
While resting, Iris`s Kibago noticed that the egg was beginning to glow but got too excited and caused the egg to fall down the nearby cliff and almost get smashed by a rock. Thankfully, Pikachu`s Quick Attack was fast enough to rescue the egg in time. After hatching, Ash`s Zuruggu`s initial attitude was very overbearing as Pikachu attempted to greet it but it used headbutt on Pikachu. Ash then sent out his other Pokémon but Ash`s Zuruggu ended up fighting them as well. Ash tried to capture it after battling his other Pokémon but it refused to be caught by him at that time.
After its encounter with a group of Dentula, Ash`s other Pokémon came to Ash`s Zuruggu rescue as it was greatly over matched. Ash could tell that it was beginning to trust him. Dent then suggested that Ash`s Zuruggu battle Iris`s Kibago as all the other Pokémon were too strong. Both Pokémon agreed but they ended up knocking each other out at the same time. Ash`s Zuruggu was finally caught after the battle as it had grown to like Ash.</description>

Iris and friends first encountered it when Iris`s Axew lost one of the apples it was eating and chased it down the hill. Iris ran after get Kibago only to come across the Emonga who had picked up the apple Iris`s Axew was chasing after. Iris`s Emolga noticed that Iris was carrying a lot more apples and realized that if it returned the one apple to Iris`s Axew that Iris might reward it by giving it a lot more of the apples she was carrying.
Bianca who was with Iris and friends at the time, quickly fell in love with the Emonga and wanted to catch it but after an uncomfortable hug, Emonga quickly learned that it didn`t want to be caught by Bianca and it shocked her. Still determined to capture it, Bianca followed it for a while until Emonga finally made its intentions clear that it wanted to be caught by Iris. Iris`s Emolga jumped into Iris`s arms and then allowed itself to be caught by her Poké Ball.
Don George Tournament - Raimon Town
Stephan`s Sawk battled against Iris`s Emolga in the second round of the Don George Battle Tournament in Raimon Town but Emonga`s Static ability proved to be the deciding factor in the match. The Static ability ended up paralyzing Stephan`s Sawk and it was then a sitting target for Iris`s Emolga`s Volt Switch which knocked it out. Iris`s Emolga`s win eliminated Stephan from the tournament.</description>

Don George Tournament - Raimon Town
Luke`s Larvesta battled against Cilan`s Stunfisk in the second round of the Don Battles Tournament in Raimon Town. Luke`s Larvesta used String Shot as an attack and a defense in the battle which showed Cilan that Luke knew how to battle with his Larvesta. When Cilan`s Stunfisk was wrapped up with String Shot, Cilan allowed it to get hit by Flamethrower to set it loose. Luke`s Larvesta ended up defeating Cilan`s Stunfisk with a powerful Flamethrower though which eliminated Cilan from the tournament.
Battle against Skyla
Skyla`s Swoobat was matched up against Cilan`s Stunfisk in Skyla`s air battle and she believed that her Swoobat would be victorious. In the actual gym battle, Cilan`s Crustle was replaced by Cilan`s Stunfisk to determine the winner of the match after it was defeated by Skyla`s Swanna. Cilan`s Stunfisk started off with a Thundershock but Skyla`s Swanna shook it off fairly easily and Skyla chastened Cilan by saying that it would take at least a Thunderbolt to affect her Swanna. Skyla`s Swanna countered with a Hurricane whic tossed Cilan`s Stunfisk into the air but wasn`t too effective against it as its actually quite mobile in the air. Cilan`s Stunfisk then used Scald which also burned Skyla`s Swanna. It appeared that Skyla`s Swanna was nearing defeat but it used Aqua Ring to heal itself and then attacked with a powerful Brave Bird and knocked out Cilan`s Stunfisk to give Skyla the victory in the match.</description>

<description>Ash realized that only one of his Pokémon would be able to endure the attacks from Clay`s Excadrill and keep enduring them until there was a chance to counterattack and that was Ash`s Roggenrola. Ash`s Roggenrola kept on enduring all the attacks for quite awhile until it evolved into Ash`s Boldore. After evolving it learned two new moves and it became even stronger than when it was a Roggenrola. The battle then turned into a frontal power match between two Pokémon with strong bodies and Ash`s Roggenrola was able to counterattack against Clay`s Excadrill. Clay`s Excadrill was unable to match the power of Ash`s Roggenrola`s Rock Smash and Clay`s Excadrill was knocked out giving Ash the overall victory in the gym battle.
Tag Battle VS Bianca and Professor Juniper
After Bianca`s Shelmet and Professor Juniper`s Karrablast evolved via link trade, Professor Juniper suggested to Bianca that they team up and have a tag battle against Ash and Cilan. Ash`s Boldore and Cilan`s Crustle had recently evolved so they decided to use them against Bianca`s Escavalier and Professor Juniper`s Accelgor. The beginning of the battle went well for Bianca and Professor Juniper as Bianca`s Escavalier`s Fury Attack was excellent but Bianca hadn`t commanded it to use it. Realizing that Bianca`s Escavalier wasn`t following commands, Ash and Cilan decided to focus their attacks on it. Professor Juniper`s Accelgor managed to protect Bianca`s Escavalier as Professor Juniper explained that tag battles were all about teamwork. Professor Juniper`s Accelgor lost a lot of stamina defending Bianca`s Escavalier after it used Substitute and Bianca`s Escavalier finally realized that it needed to listen to Bianca otherwise it would loose the battle. After Professor Juniper`s Accelgor did a quick Recover, Professor Juniper`s Accelgor and Bianca`s Escavalier started working together and they combined their Hyper Beam attacks which knocked out Ash`s Boldore. Cilan`s Crustle fought back with its powerful Rock Wrecker to knock out both Bianca`s Escavalier and Professor Juniper`s Accelgor and give Ash and Cilan the tag battle win.</description>

Battle against Skyla
Skyla`s Swanna was matched up against Cilan`s Crustle in Skyla`s air battle and she believed that her Swanna would be victorious. In the actual gym battle, Cilan`s Pansage was replaced by Cilan`s Crustle after it was knocked out and Skyla`s Swoobat was one hit knocked out by Cilan`s Crustle`s Rock Wrecker. Skyla`s Swoobat was then replaced by Skyla`s Unfezant. It didn`t fare too well against Cilan`s Crustle as Rock Wrecker hit its mark once again. Skyla`s Unfezant`s Air Slash then proved to be ineffective against Cilan`s Crustle rock. Skyla`s Unfezant was then knocked out by a combination of Cilan`s Crustle`s Shell Smash and X-Scissor to give Cilan the lead in the battle.
Skyla`s Unfezant was then replaced by Skyla`s Swanna and the match-up from Skyla`s air battle would actually take place. Despite Skyla believing that she could defeat Cilan`s Crustle by using BubbleBeam in her air battle, it didn`t prove too effective in the actual battle as Cilan`s Crustle tried to protect itself by hiding in its rock shell. Cilan`s Crustle then went on the offensive and jumped out of its shell to do another Shell Smash/X-Scissor combo, but Skyla saw it coming this time and Skyla`s Swanna countered it with a Brave Bird and knocked it out.</description>

Ash wanted to prove to Suwama that Tepig was a strong Pokémon and they decided to have a battle with Ash`s Tepig as the focus. During the battle, Ash`s Tepig evolved into Ash`s Pignite. After Ash`s Pignite defeated Suwama, Suwama realized how much stronger Ash`s Pignite had become and he tried to get it to join him again thinking that it would want to rejoin him despite the fact that he had rejected him a second time the day before. Ash`s Pignite pretended that he was interested for a few moments before blowing fire into Suwama`s face. Suwama ran off in psychotic pain while telling Ash`s Pignite to remember him.
Gym Battle against Brycen
Ash`s Pignite was then sent out to battle Brycen`s Cryogonal and like Ash`s Scraggy, it had a hard time attacking and defending against Rapid Spin. The Rapid Spin was strengthened to ward off and mitigate disadvantageous moves and Brycen countermeasures were almost perfect. It wasn`t until Ash realized they could use Fire Pledge at the center of the rotation of Rapid Spin to knock it off. The strategy worked and Brycen`s Cryogonal was knocked out.
Brycen`s Beartic replaced Brycen`s Cryogonal and Ash`s Pignite quickly found itself being outmatched despite the type advantage. Brycen`s Beartic used Brine and Aerial Ace to quickly knock Ash`s Pignite out.</description>
