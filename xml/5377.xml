<description>The Five Killers was supposed to be an original creation from writer/producer Eric Calderon as an animated TV series (12 episodes with a 1 hour finale) done by http://anidb.net/cr735 [Gonzo]. The designs were created by manga artist http://anidb.net/cr9960 [Maeshima Shigeki] and the trailer was done under the direction of http://anidb.net/a2810 [Trinity Blood] director http://anidb.net/cr5510 [Hirata Tomohiro]. The trailer is unfortunately all that came out of this project due to http://anidb.net/cr806 [GDH]`s alarming financial situation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>
