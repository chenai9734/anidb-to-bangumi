<recommendations total="2">
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="280680">Just like usual "sports" anime, you`ll ends up liking it mainly because of the embellished images of your favorite sports. So if you didn`t like mahjong or hating table games overall, turn back and look for another anime.
But if you somehow find the "first season" entertaining, then try watching this, but don`t expect too much just because the first season is somehow entertaining.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="253370">Screw the rating, since it`s probably just people who watched it for the first time, thinking it`s another one of those moe animes that they can easily get into.

For fans, since it IS a side story of the original, and for people who are interested in ability mahjong.  This series LACKS details of the matches, which is a drag, but eh!</recommendation>

<description>The Achiga Girls` Academy in Nara once defeated regional mahjong powerhouse Bansei High School. It advanced into the national team semifinals but lost to the eventual champion, and the mahjong club was later disbanded.
Six years later, elementary school student http://anidb.net/ch39190 [Takakamo Shizuno] befriends transfer student http://anidb.net/ch3833 [Haramura Nodoka]. The two eventually enter Achiga Girls`, but Nodoka transfers out of the school in the second year.
When Shizuno sees Nodoka on television the following year as the national middle school individual mahjong champion, she decides to revive Achiga`s mahjong club.

<description>An energetic character, often also called a genki character, shows great, often excessive levels of activity or vitality, and seems to always be doing everything extra fast. Genki characters are often slightly, or sometimes very, eccentric, and are filled with confidence and determination, regardless of whether they are competent or not; in fact, they often have little to no actual competence at whatever they generally do. Although genki characters are usually played exclusively for comedy effect, sometimes they may slow down for a serious or introspective moment. The most common genki character archetype is the genki schoolgirl, who will often be late to school and run with a toast in her mouth.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>school clubs</name>
<description>Even though school clubs in Japan are not mandatory, there is some pressure from the social grid (e.g. fellow students, teachers) to participate in some kind of after-school activity, be it in sports or arts. Colleges also have clubs.
As a comedy element in anime, some students have joined too many clubs, and are thus constantly stressed out. There is also the element of social commentary, making it clear that you have to join a club, if you want to be part of the class. Since self-founded clubs need at least 3 members, the desperate search and advertising for new members can be cause for hilarity in anime.</description>

<description>Shoujo Ai means girls love, and thus explores what happens when two girls (or women) fall in love.

This is not; that means there is no graphic sex.

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate.

<name>adapted into JDrama</name>
<description>This anime is a http://anidb.net/t2797 [new original work], and it has been adapted into a JDrama.
A JDrama (Japanese drama), also called "terebi dorama" ("television drama") or "dorama" for short, is a Japanese live action television series.
Japan produces many drama series every year, from a huge variety of genres. Like anime, they generally air in three-month seasons or multiples thereof, with new shows airing every season. Some kinds of drama, especially the morning or afternoon ones, tend to be broadcast daily, while evening ones tend to be broadcast weekly, also like anime.
In exceedingly rare instances, a specific episode of a new original work anime can also be adapted.</description>

<name>ensemble cast</name>
<description>A show with an ensemble cast focuses on a larger group of main characters in a single plot narrative; anime containing several segmented plot narratives (such as episodic or arc-based plots) are excluded. As such, it doesn`t really have a "main" or "lead" character; instead, every member of the central main character group plays an important part in the show`s grander scheme; no single character is more important or prominent than the others (equality of importance). Further, subplots (if any) lead by each character in the ensemble have equal weighting in importance (or lack of weight).

* In a show where no single main character is more important or prominent than the others, 4+ main characters is almost always an ensemble cast.
* A show with 3 main characters of equal importance is likely also an ensemble cast; equality of importance must be considered carefully.
* A show with 2 main characters of equal importance is generally not an ensemble cast situation; however, on an exception basis where neither main character is considered an antagonist, a 2-main-character anime may be considered an ensemble (e.g. http://anidb.net/a11829 [Kimi no Na wa.]).

<description>Sometimes normal just doesn`t cut it. Eating: you put food in your mouth and chew. Playing sports: you throw a ball around. You need to make it awesome, no matter how mundane it is.
Let`s throw in some gripping orchestral music, lighting changes, different camera angles, something! Don`t write like a man, write like an evil overlord! Exaggerate your expressions and gestures, speak with excessive intonation, and if all else fails, throw in some close-ups, slow motion, and ominous Latin chanting! With practice, even you can turn something like eating chips into an epic battle of light and dark, blinding the viewer with sheer awesomeness.

<description>Someya Mako is a second year student at Kiyosumi High School and plays the sergeant (2nd) position. Mako was introduced to mahjong at an early age as her grandfather owned a mahjong parlor and she regularly visited there (she now works there as a waitress). As a result of this, she picks up her peculiar speech manner and more importantly her special ability. Nicknamed "Spindle Territory", it allows her to memorize games she has seen or played in so as to be able to recall them in similar situations. She utilizes this when she takes her glasses off.</description>

However, she cannot stay focused and makes more mistakes as the game progresses. She is often seen eating tacos, which seem to increase her skill when playing mahjong. Additionally, food with names similar to taco, like the Japanese hot dogs sliced like an octopus can increase her skill partially as well.</description>

<summary>At the prefectural tournament, the Achiga team defeats Bansei in the first round and eventually qualify to the nationals. To train for the nationals, Harue schedules the club to play against prefectural runner-ups. Immediately, Ako utters "Nagano", Kiyosumi`s prefecture, as the first one to visit, and therefore, they play Ryuumonbuchi High. There, Amae Koromo overwhelmingly defeats Shizuno but doesn`t discourage her or the team. Then, the excited team proceed to defeat other schools at other prefectures. After a ten day training camp, the girls set off for the nationals. Whilst stopping at a rest stop, Shizuno and the others meet Onjouji Toki and Shimizudani Ryuuka from Senriyama Girl`s High, who are also seeded in the nationals. As the club finally reach the nationals, they briefly pass by Miyanaga Saki.

<summary>During elementary school, Takakamo Shizuno and Atarashi Ako make friends with the recently transferred Haramura Nodoka. Upon hearing about her interest in mahjong, Shizuno and Ako take Nodoka to Achiga Girl`s Academy, where she meets Akado Harue who runs a mahjong club for children. Nodoka starts playing mahjong with the others, including the clubs top player, Matsumi Kuro. Shizuno later explains to Nodoka how Harue was Achiga`s ace mahjong player, who ended up quitting after being defeated in a tournament, leading to the main club being disbanded. As time passes, Harue is scouted for a company`s mahjong team which leads to the closure of the children`s club. As Shizuno and Nodoka enter Achiga upon reaching middle school, Nodoka reveals she is going to be transferred the next spring. As the years pass, Shizuno, now in her third year, sees Nodoka on television winning the individual tournament. Wanting to reach the inter-high national tournament, Shizuno goes to Achiga`s club room where she encounters Kuro and decides to revive the mahjong club so she can meet Nodoka again. Upon hearing of this, Ako, who had went to a different middle school, decides she wants to enroll into Achiga and join the club.
