<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="347019">Love the concept - good enough to make me read the comics, which doesn`t happen often - but the execution seems sub-par. Animation isn`t that impressive and the story seems to need at least twice the airtime to be emotionally engaging. Had I a time machine I would definitely watch this - after reading the manhwa.

So my recommendation is to watch this after reading season 8 - chapter 404 until... 477ish - of the comic. Story of this OVA is barely related to the sequel Awakening, where Awakening comes from season 1 of the comic. If reading the comic, I would recommend watching each anime after its respective source season, if not then this as the prequel is very slightly better. If you want to watch an anime to decide if it`s worth reading the comic, watch the sequel - more action, less/smaller spoilers and after S1 of the comic all the story will be new. Then come back to this once you`ve read S8.</recommendation>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<name>past</name>
<description>Anime that takes place in the past or clearly seems to take place in the past in case of an alternative universe. This category should almost always go together with one of its sub-categories, because the past can either be a depiction of a historical event(s) or not, in which case it would be alternative past.</description>

Rai is a very elegant and mysterious Noble. He has no knowledge whatsoever of the 21st century, and will often become lost and confused especially with regards to modern day technology (such as using a cell phone). He is often used as the manhwa`s comic relief with his love of ramen and the errors he makes with technology. He has fallen into a deep slumber for 820 years, and had woken up in an abandoned building in South Korea. After seeing what most of the humans on the streets were wearing, Rai took on the uniform of a student from Ye Ran High School, which is under the administration of Frankenstein, and inadvertently followed the students there.</description>
