<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="94891">I tried this anime out and I don`t regret it. Beautiful story and character development.
The anime shows that not everything in life ends with a happy end, its shows many hardships and how you can master it. WATCH IT.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="166147">Simply perfect. Great drama with deep meaning and superb way of expression. A must see for everyone into serious animes.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="326930">Really good one.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="267227">What are you guys waiting for just start watching Rainbow already. I assure you guys your not gonna waste your time, instead your wanting some more.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="9461">Emo youth fighter turbo. Seriously, get a kleenex box if you watch this. It`s about juveniles being harrassed by adults while trying to achieve their live`s dreams.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="172944">A fantastic series about friendship, hatred, revenge, sorrow, cruelty and hope. This has the makings of a classic. The insertion of sketch-like still frames, freezing the action for dramatic effect, brings to mind some of the classic anime I`ve long loved. This is not a lighthearted, easy-to-watch anime, but it`s one that will stay with you.
(Very heavy on the tragedy, so don`t watch too much in one sitting, you may need breaks here and there to consume something more lighthearted or you might just break.)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="276083">No fucking idea why this isn`t more popular.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="319389">Honestly one of the sickest, yet most brilliant manga and Anime ever. I seriously didn`t know that Anime could bring on such terror, sadness and have such nail biting scenes. Beautiful art and a classic for many years to come.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
I think deadman wonderland should have followed suite with rainbow.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="422302">can`t say anything... awesome!
It`s hard and brutal at the beginning but the anime shows us how hard life can be!
love it!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="341694">Hands down the best show of 2010. The only fault I have with the show is that they didn`t adapt the entire manga which seemed like an obvious thing to do when it`s already complete. A second season would be great although sales are probably hindering that. Too bad.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="442948">Breathtaking very awesome anime!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="531769">OMG This is 10/10 and I don`t understand how can some one dare to rate it less than 10 :)
I mean this is really GOOOOOOOD that I wish if there is more than 10 to rate it I really thank every single one who worked on this anime ^_^</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="717410">Listen, I don`t cry very often, but this anime made me cry more times than I care to admit. Excellent story telling, great character development, realistic antagonists, and damn good writing. Not only that, but the story had great pacing, it was brutally honest and had great animation. I would highly suggest this anime; it will be a long time before I will be able to find anything like it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="274914">The superb storytelling brings life to the characters, making for a touching masterpiece.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="382948">Brace yourselves. This is series is not for the heart fainted. It is brutal as it is beautiful. Its truly a masterpiece.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="374208">awesome anime. this one cuts the crap and gets to the good parts. I like that in an anime. thumbs up. comedy / moe  lovers stay away from this.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="212383">Its a classic...Older generation (Over 18) will appreciate it more because of its themes. Rarely would I say something is a 10 but this is up on that list. Every episode is worth crying for, cheering for, and hoping for each character. I made the mistake of skipping this when it initially came out. PLEASE DON`T DO THE SAME!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="482981">it`s quite an emotional experience. I even don`t feel uncomfortable to confess that it made me cry several times. So real, so earthly cruel, so true, so touching, so captivating that you mustn`t skip this series.</recommendation>

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>delinquent</name>
<description>Delinquents - Every school has them, but not all anime with school setting make delinquents a central topic. There are several versions of these delinquents, though some are grounded on a misunderstanding:
* The student with a really bad image and attitude, based on his real criminal actions outside of the school and is even feared by teachers.
* The primitive "class bully" that pushes around ("clobbers") his classmates for no apparent reason, possibly extorting lunch money.
* The student with an sinister complexion or "evil eye", but is actually a "good" student (unfoundedly feared character).
* The rebellious student, who does not care for studying, but is otherwise docile. Called a "delinquent" as a joke.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence.

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>World War II</name>
<description>World War II, or the Second World War (often abbreviated WWII or WW2), was a global military conflict which involved most of the world`s nations, including all great powers, organised into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. The war involved the mobilisation of over 100 million military personnel, making it the most widespread war in history. In a state of "total war," the major participants placed their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities at the service of the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Over seventy million people, the majority civilians, were killed, making it the deadliest conflict in human history.
The start of the war is generally held to be September 1, 1939, with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by most of the countries in the British Empire and Commonwealth, and by France. Many countries were already at war before this date, such as Ethiopia and Italy in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War and China and Japan in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Many who were not initially involved joined the war later, as a result of events such as the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the attacks on Pearl Harbor and British colonies, and subsequent declarations of war on Japan by the United States, the Netherlands, and British Commonwealth.
In 1945, the war ended in a victory for the Allies. The Soviet Union and the United States subsequently emerged as the world`s superpowers, setting the stage for the Cold War which continued for the next 46 years. The United Nations was formed in the hope of preventing another world conflict. The acceptance of the principle of self-determination accelerated decolonization movements in Asia and Africa, while Western Europe itself began moving toward integration.

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>school life</name>
<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>manly tears</name>
<description>Somewhere down the line, it became the "norm" that boys don`t cry. The scenario does not matter; shedding tears is the ultimate no-no in terms of what you can and cannot do as a man (at least in the West, anyway). But there comes a time when a man`s emotions do get the better of him, and they pour forth - as prerequisite an impassioned speech may or may not be present - by cascading down his cheeks. These are what we like to call "manly tears". Extremely powerful. Not limited but often used in hot-blooded / super robot shows. Examples include Yuusha Ou GaoGaiGar, Getter Robo and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.
The opposite of manly tears are "girly tears".</description>

<description>Sakuragi Rokurouta, aged eighteen, and referred as `An-chan` by his cell mates, is one of the seven protagonists in RAINBOW. He is strong and have great boxing technique which he used to take on all the six new comers when Mario instigated a fight.
Although it seemed he looked down upon the six new cell mates in the beginning, which lead to a fight he won with ease, the six new cell mates found out later that Sakuragi is in reality a guy worthy to look upon and soon start to refer him as An-chan, which can be translated as an `intimate bro`.
The reason why Sakuragi has been detained is unknown. It seems Sakuragi holds the key to lead the six new comers to the outside world when they end their detention in two years time.</description>
