<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges.

Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<description>Any anime that is based on a role-playing game aka RPG. A role-playing video game is a video game which includes elements of non-electronic role-playing games. The player assumes control of one or several fictional characters (a party) who have joined forces in order to perform quests and overcome a great number of challenges and enemies, usually monsters inspired by fantasy, and, to a lesser extent, science fiction and classic mythology. During the course of the game the characters, or avatars, which are generally defined by quantized characteristics, evolve and improve in that their various attributes increase, as well as by gaining more powerful artefacts.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>proxy battles</name>
<description>In our terms, a proxy battle is a battle where humans use creatures/robots to do the fighting for them, either by commanding those creatures/robots or by simply evolving them/changing them into battle mode. Often the training aspect is also involved, or in some cases the proxies are nothing more than holographic representatives of some other variation of competition (like for example a card game). While many popular shounen anime fit under this category, it`s not limited to shounen anime.</description>

<description>Pidgey, known as the Tiny Bird Pokémon, is a bird-like Pokémon, whose original name in the English beta version of Pokémon Red and Blue was "Pidge". Pidgey was first introduced in the United States in Red and Blue. They are one of the first wild Pokémon that players encounter in those games. Pidgey does not like to fight, and will use its wings to stir up clouds of sand in an attempt to distract its would-be opponent and escape. Pidgey also uses this technique to bring its preferred prey of small insects into the open. Pidgey seems to possess magnetoception, as it is capable of returning to its nest from any location without fail.
Pidgey also appeared in the first television episode, Pokémon, I Choose You!, when the main character, Ash Ketchum, attempts to catch one. He fails when it uses its Gust attack to blow him away and escapes. Afterwards, it uses its Sand Attack to blind Ash, allowing it to get away.</description>

<description>Pidgeotto, known as the Bird Pokémon, is a bird-like Pokémon, is a larger and stronger form that Pidgey takes when it gains enough experience. In the main Pokémon game series, a Pidgeotto is only acquired when a Pidgey grows past experience level 18 and evolves into a Pidgeotto. A Pidgeotto is extremely territorial, generally claiming a large area with its nest built in the center. Full of vitality, it constantly patrols its territory, mercilessly attacking intruders. They fly about in circular patterns while hunting, and can spot the movements of their prey on the ground no matter how high they fly. The Pidgeotto attacks with its wickedly sharp talons and carries its prey, including Exeggcute and Magikarp, back to its nest from as far as 60 miles away - or more.
Pidgeotto was the second Pokémon Ash caught in the beginning of his career, eventually evolving into Pidgeot.</description>

Psyduck is known for its never-ending headache; in the anime, its strongest attacks can be used only when its headache reaches extremely painful levels. It is slow-witted and clumsy by nature, and the vacant expression often unnerves its foes. It evolves into Golduck at level 33. Is thought to be cute and very smart!

<description>Bellsprout is a carnivorous, flower-like Pokémon, hunting small insects with blinding agility despite its skinny body. It is said to ensnare its prey in its vines and devour it, and can also spit a highly corrosive fluid that can melt even iron. Bellsprout`s preferred habitat is warm and humid climates, since it can absorb more moisture from the ground by planting its root-like feet. In battle, Bellsprout can take advantage of its flexibility to bend and sway its way out of the range of its opponent`s attacks, no matter how powerful they may be.
In the video games, Bellsprout is commonly found among grassy routes, and is used by many Trainers who favor the Grass-type. In Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, the Sprout Tower in Violet City is dedicated to Bellsprout.
Bellsprout has appeared numerous times in the anime series, most notably in "The Fourth Round Rumble," where Ash battled one during the Indigo League. He eventually defeated it with Muk.</description>

<description>Articuno is one of the three Legendary Birds along with Zapdos and Moltres. It is a large bird with blue plumage, a bluish-white-feathered chest, a three feathered crest adorning its nose, and a long, sparkling tail. It can create and manipulate ice freely. Its translucent wings are imbued with the essence of frigidity, and the flapping of its wings chills the air, causing the conversion of water particles in the air into snow or ice, causing snow to fall when it flies overhead. In legend, Articuno resides within the confines of icy mountains, because those who have seen its were often doomed explorers scaling such mountains, and therefore it is believed Articuno makes it a point to appear before them and save them.
It is interesting to note that the last letters of its name, "uno" ("one" in Spanish), suggest it is the first of the three legendary bird Pokémon. This is reinforced by the fact that the last letters of the names of its fellow legendary birds suggest that they are the second and third. They are Zapdos ("dos", which is "two" in Spanish) and Moltres ("tres", which is "three" in Spanish).
Articuno`s video game appearances occur in the very confusing mazes of the icy Seafoam Islands, on Route 20, between Fuschia City and Cinnabar Island. It is a unique Pokémon that usually appears alongside Zapdos and Moltres. Since only one of each exists in the games, players usually try to catch the Birds.
Articuno also makes appearances in the anime and manga, also as a unique Pokémon and a general species. They participate in various events and battles. Articuno was initially believed to be the large golden bird Ash saw in the very first episode, but it turned out to actually be Ho-Oh, though the earlier reference was kept in the Red, Blue, Yellow game versions when one looked into a telescope and saw it. Its largest role is in Pokémon: The Movie 2000. Lawrence III creates a battle between the three birds, and Ash Ketchum had to team up with Lugia to stop them. In the beginning of the Battle Frontier challenge in the anime, Noland, the battle factory frontier brain had befriended one. After reuniting with their photographer friend Todd, Ash and its friends hear a rumor that Articuno lives on a certain mountain. After several encounters with Team Rocket, Ash and Todd are saved by Articuno from a snowstorm, and Todd manages to snap a picture of it. Ash`s Charizard did battle with it and Articuno lost by a narrow margin.
In Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, Articuno is the third legendary boss as well as the third legendary bird you battle. He is also the hardest to convince of the three legendary birds that the main hero Pokémon is not responsible for the havocs in the Pokémon World. Absol prevents Articuno from ending the hero and partner by ensuring that Articuno knows the truth.</description>

<description>Zapdos is one of the three Legendary Birds along with Articuno and Moltres. It may be based on the thunderbird. It is a bird with a yellow, angular body and wings. Also behind its main yellow wings is a second pair of thinner, jet-black wings. Its beak is long and extremely sharp. Zapdos, a creature that can freely manipulate electricity, is thought to live in thunderclouds, where it apparently only gains power when struck by lightning. It is seen emerging from clouds while dropping enormous lightning bolts, and even if it does not launch electricity its wings make peculiar crackling and snapping sounds as it flies.
It is interesting to note that the last letters of its name, "dos" ("two" in Spanish), suggest it is the second of the three legendary bird Pokémon. This is reinforced by the fact that the last letters of the names of its fellow legendary birds suggest that they are the first and third. They are Articuno ("uno", which is "one" in Spanish) and Moltres ("tres", which is "three" in Spanish).
Zapdos is found in a Power Plant off the coast of the Rock Tunnel near Cerulean City in Pokémon Red and Blue, and related games. It also plays small roles in the anime and manga. Zapdos is featured in Pokémon The Movie 2000 together with the other two Legendary birds, Articuno and Moltres. It appears that Zapdos communicates through electricity as it shocks Pikachu to communicate. Zapdos also appeared in the 9th Pokémon Movie.</description>

<description>Moltres is one of the three Legendary Birds, along with Articuno and Zapdos. It is a large bird that is literally ablaze with fire, resembling something related to a phoenix. It has an orange body, a small pointed beak, and where its plumage should be are flames of a searing intensity. It can freely create and manipulate fire, and it constantly looses flaming embers from its wings. When its body is injured for any reason, it will head towards a volcano and dip its body in the molten magma to heal its wounds. Moltres is an elusive creature, seen about as rarely as the other two members of the Legendary Bird triad. When Moltres thinks it is in the least bit possible danger, it will summon a flash of fire and seemingly disappear, flying out of sight very fast.
The first video game appearance of Moltres was in Pokémon Red and Blue versions. In these Versions, Moltres was in a blocked off area of Victory Road, only accessible from the end of the cave. However, Moltres was moved from its lair in FireRed and LeafGreen, to Mount Ember, an active volcano, on 1 Island, the first of the new Sevii Islands.
The first official appearance of Moltres in the anime was in the episode that marks the beginning of the Pokémon League, where it lights the torch which is equivalent to the real-life Olympic Torch. It also plays a role in "Pokémon The Movie 2000: The Power of One", along with the other two Legendary Birds (Zapdos and Articuno). It was one of the two birds that the villainous collector, often referred to as both Gelardan and Lawrence III, captured to allow him access to Lugia`s power, but the upset of the balance that occurred as a result nearly caused a worldwide weather catastrophe as Moltres was driven to wage war with its two rivals. They were quelled once Ash and Lugia fulfilled the prophecy related to the legendary birds. In a later episode of Pokémon Chronicles, Ash`s rival Richie encountered a trainer named Silver who wanted to capture Moltres, battling him with its Salamence. Silver is interrupted by Team Rocket members Butch and Cassidy who attempt to kidnap Moltres, rather than catching him fairly. Richie and Silver team up to defeat Butch and Cassidy and rescue Moltres, although the firebird was badly weakened by the Rockets` attack. Silver let Moltres go, wanting to catch him in a fair fight when it was at full strength, although it promised it`d try again.
According to one of the trainers in Blaine`s gym on Cinnabar Island, Blaine decided to become a trainer of Fire-type Pokémon after having been rescued by a fiery bird when lost in the mountains.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Mewtwo, known as the "Genetic" species of Pokémon, is a Pokémon cloned from Mew that exists quietly in an undiscovered cave. It was created by scientists through genetic manipulation of Mew`s DNA involving repeated recombination, gene splicing, and other DNA experiments over many years. While its DNA is mostly similar to the original Mew DNA, Mewtwo is very different in both its body size and personality. Its creators did not imbue him with compassion, making it one of the most savage Pokémon, able to strike fear into its enemies with its cold, glowing eyes. Being made for battle, its combat abilities and psychic powers were developed to be of the highest level, and it always thinks of defeating its opponents. In order to always fight at full power, it remains motionless to conserve energy.
In the events of the Pokémon: The First Movie, Mewtwo awakens, destroys the laboratory where it is created and being kept, and works under Giovanni, who had originally ordered Mewtwo`s creation, until realizing it is just being used. After escaping, it tries to destroy the humans that `enslave` Pokémon and start a new world. During Pokémon: Mewtwo Returns, it seeks complete solitude and chooses to live without fighting. Giovanni tries to recapture Mewtwo, but it is ultimately saved by Ash. Mewtwo chooses not to confine himself to the world and roams the earth. In the "Mastermind of the Mirage Pokémon" a mirage copy of Mewtwo is seen furiously battling Ash and its friends.</description>

<description>Mew is a Psychic-type legendary Pokémon. It was first introduced as a secret Pokémon in the first generation. Nintendo`s specialists in Pokémon have spoken, in Nintendo`s Pokémon-related speech in 2007, that Mewtwo is more powerful than Mew, therefore being a clone (better from the original: Pokémon Red and Blue and Yellow). Mew appears as a pink feline-esque Pokémon with large feet, big blue eyes, and a very long tail. Its skin is covered with a layer of fine pink hair. By nature, Mew is known to be a playful and kind Pokémon. Its DNA is said to possess the genetic composition of all existing Pokémon species, thus allowing it to use all known Pokémon techniques. In the anime, it is also capable of further teleportation, summoning giant pink bubbles of psychic energy (which serve various purposes such as closing itself in for protection, act as a cushion, or simply for Mew`s amusement of bouncing on), and rendering itself invisible.
In the first generation video games, Mew is mentioned in journal entries found in the Pokémon Mansion on Cinnabar Island stating that it was discovered deep in the jungles of Guyana, South America on July 5 (the year was not specified) and named on July 10, and that it "gave birth" to Mewtwo on Feb. 6. Mew was available at Kiosks during special events held by Nintendo after the release of Red, Blue, and Yellow. However, a glitch exists in these Generation I games that allows the player to capture a level 7 Mew.
Mew plays a role in some of the Pokémon anime films. In Pokémon: The First Movie, Mewtwo was created from a fossilized Mew hair found in the Amazon. A single Mew travels to where Mewtwo is holding its tournament in order to convince it to stop. It also made a short appearance in Mewtwo Returns (a special episode involving the whole of Team Rocket (including Giovanni) and Mewtwo, as well as various other characters.) In Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew, the backdrop revolves around Mew`s mysterious history and how this extremely rare Pokémon came to be so powerful. Also, at the beginning of the movie, a Pokémon "family tree" is shown. The first Pokémon on it is Mew, and the last is Ho-oh. Since Mew contains the genetic composition that is found in every species of Pokémon, Mew has the ability to transform into any Pokémon like Ditto. However, in the anime, Mew does not need to see the Pokémon in order to transform into it.</description>

<description>Sentret is a very cautious Pokémon, it raises itself up onto its tail to get a better view of its surroundings. While standing on its tail, it can see a long way. If it spots an enemy, it will cry out loudly to warn its kind. It will also hit the ground with its tail. A Sentret will only sleep when another one is standing guard. The Sentret will wake the others at the first sign of danger. Because of this, if one is separated from its pack, then it will be unable to sleep due to fear.
Sentret is based on a squirrel.</description>

<description>Ledian is a moderately large, bipedal creature with a huge head and six small limbs. It also has star patterns on its back, which grow larger or smaller depending on the number of stars visible in the night sky. Each spot represents a corner of a star shape. These spots have also been observed glowing red during twilight hours as Ledian are attached to trees, making these trees seem like Christmas trees. Male Ledian are shown having longer antennae than females.
Ledian is a nocturnal insect, active mainly during the night and sleeping in curled-up leaves during the day. Countless Ledian live in outdoor areas located a good distance away from the polluted atmospheres of cities, for the star-lit skies are always clearer in these clean lands than in the light pollution of urban areas. Ledian have an affinity to stars for good reason; They take their energy from the light of the stars in order to live healthily. When many stars are visible, the Ledian will sprinkle a mysterious, glowing powder whilst fluttering about.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Crobat is the evolution of Golbat as of the Gold and Silver editions of the game. It`s a purple bat with four wings, with two main wings above and two secondary wings below. The development of these lower wings to replace its legs, as a result of its pursuit of faster, yet more silent flight, enables it to fly fast and silently indeed, but also makes it tough to stop and rest. Its extra wings will even allow it to fly long distances by alternating which set of wings it uses when it tires. The only way it can rest is to hang on a tree branch using its lower legs to grab onto it the way normal bats would. It flies so silently through the dark on its four wings that it may not be noticed even when nearby. It uses this to its advantage when hunting prey.
The appearances of Crobat in the anime have been largely of Brock`s Crobat. Brock caught a Zubat very early on in the original series, and it evolved into a Golbat, and then a Crobat.</description>

<description>Marill is an aquatic mouse Pokémon. Marill`s tail floats like a buoy because it is filled with oil, which is less dense than water. When fishing at a fast-running stream, Marill wraps its tail around a tree. Since the tail is stretchy and flexible, it allows the Pokémon to get food and still stay safely anchored. Otherwise, when in a lake, it uses the buoy-qualities of its tail to keep itself suspended as the rest of its body dives underwater to feed on aquatic plants. Its fur is impermeable, which keeps it dry, and that allows it to swim through water at high speed without being slowed by the water`s resistance.
In the Pokémon Anime, Tracey, the Pokémon Observer from the Orange Islands, has a Marill which he uses on multiple occasions.</description>

<description>Azumarill is the evolved form of Marill. Azumarill resembles a blue, bipedal rabbit with a large, ellipsoid body, long blue ears with red insides, and a blue ball on the end of its thin, elastic black tail. The white bubble-like pattern on its lower stomach helps it to camouflage itself from potential predators when it is in the water.
Azumarill`s long ears act as sensors to identify sounds even in fast running rivers. Otherwise, when alone, Azumarill plays in water as a natural pastime, though it must roll up its elongated ears to prevent the sensitive sensory materials inside them from getting wet. The ball at the end of its tail can act as a sensor and guide it while under water. It can make thick, liquid balloons out of thin air with the saliva-water stored in its body. If it spots a drowning Pokémon in any body of water, it fashions such air balloons and jumps in to give the troubled Pokémon air balloons to help it breathe.
In the Pokémon anime, Paul owned an Azumarill which he used in a gym battle against Roark. Although it knew powerful Water attacks like Hydro Pump, it lost to Roark`s Geodude, which prompted Paul to give it to a Pokémon trainer passing by, being disappointed by its strength.</description>

<description>Sudowoodo is a bending, bipedal creature vaguely in the shape of a tree trunk. It has a double-pronged protuberance on its head, tiny feet, a simple face, and a pair of three-fingered hands where the fingers are green spheres resembling leaves on a tree. Although Sudowoodo pretends to be a tree, its body is made not out of wood, but rock. It uses this as a form of camouflage, hiding among forest areas to avoid being attacked by enemies. Additionally, its signature technique is Mimic, which allows it to copy enemy attacks. It earns its classification as the imitation Pokémon through these practices.
In the winter seasons, when trees are either white with snow or have had their leaves fall off from autumn, Sudowoodo is easy to spot as a fake because its hands remain green, making winter a more dangerous time for Sudowoodo to be in the presence of foes. Also, as a creature whose composition resembles rock, Sudowoodo hates water, so it will disappear and seek shelter when rainfall begins. In the video games, it often blocks areas until sprayed with water, which causes it to battle. In Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, the twig-shaped appendage atop a Sudowoodo`s head is larger on a male than it is on a female. The origin of its name is: Pseudo (False) + Wood.</description>

<description>Aipom resembles a purple squirrel monkey with its face forever frozen in a maniacal grin that can be described as rictus and a blank stare from its round eyes. On its thin tail is a three fingered hand-like appendage that is very dexterous. It provides both propulsion and balance while Aipom leaps from tree to tree. Aipom is not aggressive by nature and will attempt to tire its natural opponents through dexterous dodging of the opponent`s attacks in hope that the enemy will be discouraged and leave. Otherwise, if the enemy is persistent, the Aipom will try to retreat, but if it is unable to, it will attack by diving at its opponent from the trees.
In the anime, an Aipom steals Ash`s hat, and follows his group around until Ash battles and captures it. Ash`s Aipom is quite attached to him, getting incredibly jealous when it sees Pikachu on Ash`s shoulder. Aipom has the distinction of being the only Pokemon aside from Pikachu that Ash brought with him to Sinnoh, although inadvertently. Aipom seems to enjoy contests, and Dawn believes it prefers contests over battles. In "Throwing the Track Switch!", Ash trades Aipom for Dawn`s Buizel because both Pokemon seemed more interested in the other trainer`s training. In "Journey to the Unknown", Dawn`s Aipom evolves into Ambipom.</description>

<description>Sunflora is the evolved form of Sunkern. Sunflora is a diurnal sunflower Pokémon; unlike its unevolved form Sunkern, it is wholly inactive at night. However, it is very active and playful during the day when the sun is bright. Like Bellossom, it evolves using a Sun Stone. Sunflora prefer hot climates; their foliage becomes more colorful and elaborate as the temperature rises. Sunflora unfurl their petals and absorb sunlight for energy. It is possible for a Sunflora to absorb too much sunlight, though. When this happens, its head and petals become engorged and very heavy, which is dangerous for a Sunflora, since it can wilt and possibly get sick. At night, the petals are furled, covering Sunflora`s face.
A Sunflora is constantly soaking up sunlight and moving around in a blissful fashion. In preparation for winter, Sunflora will migrate to warmer and sunnier areas, so as not to lose the vital source of their energy. Sunflora like to live in flower patches. They do their best to stay hidden among the other flowers, but usually they are very noticeable.</description>

Frightened Yanma have been recorded as breaking the sound barrier. Yanma is aided when hunting by its prodigious flying ability; it navigates so perfectly that it can abruptly change direction in mid-flight without slowing down. It can evolve into a Yanmega.</description>

Their simplistic face consists of mainly of a large mouth, primarily while open. They have purplish barbed antennae on the sides of their head. Three purple, though sometimes shaded blue or pink, gills are on its stomach. Wooper will usually live in cold water: however, they occasionally come out onto land in search of food. When doing so, they coat their bodies with slimy, poisonous film. Touching the slime with bare hands will cause a shooting pain. Male Wooper have two barbs on their antennae, while female Wooper have one barb. Males also have larger gills.</description>

<description>Quagsire has an appearance and habitat similar to that of a giant salamander. Quagsire live a carefree life in muddy ponds and rivers. It acts oblivious to its environment, accidentally bumping its head on the hulls of boats and bottoms of whatever body of water it swims in as it swims, but seeming not to care. Quagsire always bear an absent-looking facial expression. This is likely due to Quagsire`s easy-going nature. It hunts by staying still in the water with its mouth open, waiting for small prey to swim into its mouth. It doesn`t move, and therefore, doesn`t get hungry. It`s not uncommon that a fishermen`s hook will get caught in the gaping mouth of a feeding Quagsire. Trying to eat what it has caught, the Quagsire would try to swallow, and end up pulling the fishermen off his boat and into the water. Male Quagsire have larger fins on their backs. They wait at the bottom of lakes waiting for prey to wander into its mouth. It also loves eating cherries.</description>

<description>Unown is a hieroglyph-like symbol with 28 different forms, based on the letters of the Latin alphabet, a question mark, and an exclamation point. They always have the similarities of a flat body with black color and one medium-size eye. They always reside in mysterious chambers, only with other Unown, always stuck on walls.
Unown is featured in Spell of the Unown as the main antagonists. The Unown create an Entei to befriend a young girl and grant all of the girl`s wishes: in the girl`s case, turning the town she lives in into crystal. Ash and friends convince the girl that Entei is not her true father, since her father was lost on an archeological dig in an Unown temple. The Unown, overpowered by the girl`s current thoughts, became unable to control their powers and larger areas were turning into crystal. Entei saves them all by attacking the Unown, sending them all back to their dimension. It has also been revealed that Dialga and Palkia live in the same dimension as the Unown.</description>

<description>Wobbuffet is a stiff, blue, balloon-shaped Pokémon based on the late Japanese comedian Sanpei Hayashiya (林家三平) (1925-1980). Hayashiya`s trademark routine involved him putting one hand to his forehead and saying "Sou nansu, okusan" (そうなんす, 奥さん) ("So it seems, madam"). This is why, in the Japanese Pokémon anime and movies, Wobbuffet is often seen putting a hand to its forehead and shouting "Soooooonansu!" (which was translated as well for the English adaptation, where it indeed says "Woooooobbuffet!"). It is voiced by Kayzie Rogers.
Wobbuffet hates light and shock, so it lives in the quiet darkness of caves and only comes out at night. If attacked, it inflates its body to bolster its amazing ability to counter-attack using the moves Counter and Mirror Coat, rather than offensive battling like most other Pokémon, for it won`t attack on its own. It does nothing but endure attacks in this fashion, suggesting that Wobbuffet either has an inability to tolerate aggressive behavior on its part, or that it is simply built to withstand attacks. However, it will not endure an attack on its valued, sensitive tail. When that happens, the Pokémon will try to take the foe with it using Destiny Bond. To keep its pitch-black tail hidden from the sight of potential attackers, it lives in black caves and atmospheres as described above.
In the Pokémon anime, Jessie has owned a Wobbuffet ever since she accidentally exchanged her Lickitung for it in the episode Tricks Of The Trade. Wobbuffet is her equivalent of Misty`s Psyduck — it has a habit of popping out of its Pokéball at inopportune times without being called, including at the end of Team Rocket`s motto.</description>

<description>Girafarig is a herbivore that resembles a giraffe. It is yellow with dark brown spots for the front half, while the back half is dark brown with yellow spots. The back section is smaller on the females. Most notably, the end of Girafarig`s tail has a simplistic head. The head has a small brain of its own, but can only rely on instinct. If a person gets near the head, it reacts to the person`s scent and bites. The head doesn`t need to sleep, so it watches over its surroundings twenty four hours a day. Girafarig`s name is a palindrome in both English and Japanese, although the Japanese name`s palindromic nature is not evident in romanised form.</description>

<description>Entei is one of the three "Legendary Beasts" that are featured in Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal. According to legend, the Legendary Beasts were reincarnated by Ho-Oh from the spirits of three Pokémon which died in the fire that gave Burnt Tower its name. They are awakened in this tower in their first video game appearance. Other myths maintains that it is born during the eruption of a volcano, and that a new one is born along with each volcano.
Entei is an embodiment of magma, being able to launch powerfully searing, fire that is hotter than magma from its mouth. This fire consumes everything that it touches. When it roars, volcanos around it are apparently triggered to erupt. Due to being unable to fully control its own power, it constantly sprints around the world.
Entei is the main Pokémon in the movie Pokémon the Movie 3: Spell of the Unown, in which the Unown create it from Molly`s imagination.</description>

They are awakened in this tower in their first video game appearance. It is the incarnation of northern winds, which always blow as it passes throughout the world. It also embodies the compassion of a spring, so as it travels, it seeks out pure reservoirs of water, and using its power, it instantly purifies dirty, muddy, or otherwise polluted water into the clearest of liquids by simply stepping into it.
In Pokémon Crystal Suicune is the star Pokémon, in a similar way that Pokémon Gold showcased Ho-oh or Pokémon Silver showcased Lugia. Eusine, a mysterious trainer, appears throughout the course of the game. He is set on meeting and catching Suicune, and will battle the player for that honor. Eventually, Suicune can be caught by heading to the Tin Tower after obtaining the Clear Bell. Three old men will challenge the player to a battle and if they are defeated, they will allow access to a floor where Suicune waits to battle.
Suicune makes various appearances in the anime, mainly appearing before Ash and his friends. It is featured in various episodes, and it plays a role in the movie, Pokémon 4Ever.</description>

<description>Lugia is a legendary Pokémon that first appears in Pokémon Gold and Silver, appearing on the boxart for Silver. Lugia, thought to be the guardian of the sea, resides deep in the ocean floor. It spends most of its time at the bottom of the sea due to its tremendous power, which includes being able to topple houses just by flapping its large, powerful wings and the ability to start storms that can last for over forty days. It is usually seen near the beginning of storms, and it often uses its wings to calm them.
It plays the role of a general legendary Pokémon in some games, where it waits in a far-off location, ready to battle. Lugia is one of the main characters of Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness. The storyline of the game depicts a "Shadow" Lugia terrorizing the locals and wreaking havoc. It is the only Shadow Pokémon whose physical appearance is different from its regular state. Shadow Lugia is said to be struggling, asking for help to free it from doing Cipher`s work in which "its deeper closed heart refuses to do". The player has to catch and Purify it for it to return to its original state.
In Pokémon: The Movie 2000, Lugia comes from the sea when the three Legendary Birds Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres are roused by a Pokémon collector who tries to catch the trio. Lugia then battles the raging Birds and, with the help of Ash and Team Rocket, manages to calm them and restore peace to nature. Lugia makes a second appearance in the Pokémon TV series when the protagonist, Ash, travels to the Whirl Islands where he meets his friend Richie to help stop a Team Rocket scientist from separating a young Lugia named "Silver" from her parent.</description>

<description>Ho-Oh is a legendary Pokémon that first appears in Pokémon Gold and Silver, appearing on Gold`s boxart. Long ago in Ecruteak City, there were two towers, the Brass Tower and Tin Tower being the roost of Lugia and Ho-Oh, respectively. When the Brass Tower burned down, both Pokémon fled, never to be seen again. Three Pokémon became trapped in the flames of the Brass Tower and perished. Ho-Oh returned to the Burned Tower and resurrected the three Pokémon, who were renamed Raikou, Entei, and Suicune. It has an unknown gender. On Gold, it is Lv40 when caught while it is Lv70 when caught in Silver. It is better to have the lower version as the move tutor does not exist in Gold/Silver.
It is called the Rainbow Pokémon due to its various associations with rainbows. Its feathers constantly change through the rainbow`s spectrum of colors as light hits them from different angles. These leave a rainbow trail as it flies continuously through the world`s skies, though it is said to live at the foot of a rainbow. It is said to appear before pure-hearted trainers as the representative of the bonds between humans and Pokémon, and bring happiness to all that see it. This is expanded upon in the anime, where it is said to appear before a hero. Ash Ketchum sees Ho-Oh various times throughout his journey, the first time being before Gold and Silver were even announced. It remained a mystery until it was revealed in Pokémon Gold.</description>

<description>Celebi is a time traveling legendary Pokémon that first debuted in Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Silver. It is the known as the guardian of the forest, where it is worshiped as a god. It wanders through time, visiting various undisturbed old-growth forests during peaceful times, leaving behind flourishing grass and trees. It often leaves behind an egg that it brought from the future. Celebi`s continuing existence signifies a good future.
Celebi cannot be captured in any English version of the Pokémon video games; however, it can be obtained at Nintendo promotional giveaway events. In Pokémon Colosseum, the power of Celebi is used to purify Shadow Pokémon. When one of the three Time Flutes in the game is used, Celebi will appear and purify a Shadow Pokémon instantly. Once all 48 Shadow Pokémon have been purified trainers playing the Japanese version of the game can obtain Celebi via the bonus disc that comes with Colosseum. On the North-American version, Celebi is replaced by Jirachi.
Despite being a legendary Pokémon, Celebi has fairly low stats, and its Psychic/Grass type cross means that 7 different types are "Super effective" against it, including a 4x weakness to Bug-types.
In the anime, Celebi is represented as a generally weak Pokémon that constantly needs protection. Celebi is one of the main characters in the movie Pokémon 4Ever. In this movie, Celebi is running away from a hunter. It crashes into young Samuel Oak who protects it, and in return, Celebi transports them forty years into the future, where Sam teams up with Ash Ketchum to save Celebi from a Team Rocket member who turns it into a Dark Celebi by capturing it in a Dark Poké Ball. Near the end of the movie, several dozen Celebi appear from all sorts of different eras in time to help out. It also makes appearances in various episodes.
In Pokemon Mystery Dungeon 2, a shiny Celebi helps a Grovyle and the Main protagonist return to their world from the future. After this, she vanishes because the future she was a part of ceased to exist due to the character stopping Primal Dialga.</description>

It can be considered a modern counterpart to the earlier butterfly Pokémon species Butterfree, but it is definitely the physical counterpart to Dustox, the other form into which a Wurmple can eventually evolve. Beautifly is a very vain and colorful butterfly with a long, coiled, needle-like mouth not unlike the proboscis of a real butterfly, which it uses both for gathering pollen in the wild and, despite their gentle appearance, for aggressively attacking opponent Pokémon when angered. It is most active in the springtime, where it rides the spring winds as it flits around gathering pollen from flower-covered fields, or from potted flowers left on windowsills.
In the Pokémon anime, Beautifly becomes May`s primary Pokémon for use in Pokémon contests early on, and Jessie`s Dustox is established as its rival.</description>

When Pelipper spots its prey, it dips its large beak into the water and scoops it up. It then proceeds to swallow it whole. Pelipper also carries the eggs of its Wingull offspring inside its beak before and after they hatch. This provides the offspring with protection and, after they hatch, nourishment from the hunted food.</description>

<description>Chimecho is known as the "Wind Chime Pokémon." Chimecho`s light frame and its psychic powers enable it to freely fly around, especially during the hot season. If a Chimecho wishes to remain in one place for a while, it employs its suction cup to affix itself on trees or the eaves of a building. Chimecho has the distinctive ability to produce a ringing cry, the volume of which is amplified inside its hollow head and comes out as a chiming sound. A Chimecho can produce seven different tones to communicate various messages to its kindred. If threatened, Chimecho can use its cries as a defensive weapon, turning them into ultrasonic waves that knock its foes back.
Although Chimecho did not officially exist at that time, a figure of it appears in the TV episode "The Ghost of Maiden`s Peak" on one of the small lantern ships (18:30-18:35 in the US version).</description>

<description>Regirock is a legendary Pokémon in Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire and Pokémon Emerald that can only be caught in the Desert Ruins once in each game. It was sealed there long before the series. It can also be found inside of a cave in Pokémon Ranger. It will be obtainable in Pokémon Platinum in a cave at Route 228 only if the special Regigigas from the eleventh movie is transferred to the Platinum game. Being made completely out of rock, it has no brain or heart, which baffles the scientists of the Pokémon universe. Regirock along with its brothers Regice and Registeel often fill guardian roles; they are normally guarding their king, (Regigigas), but they also have been seen at The Tree of Beginning, and guarding (Mew). The various rocks that it is composed of come from different locations. If damaged in battle, it will repair itself with rocks it finds nearby.
It also appears to represent the Stone Age just like fellow Regis, Regice who represents the Ice Age, Registeel who represents the Iron Age and Regigigas who represents the time of Pangaea.</description>

<name>Latias</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Latias is the female Eon Pokémon from the Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald series of games and is one of a duo of Psychic/Dragon-type Pokémon, the other being Latios. These two are the only legendary Pokémon in the games that have genders (other than Heatran and Cresselia, which first appear in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.)
Latias is a red-and-white dragon Pokémon with small arms and feet, and spiky wings on her back. She has triangle-shaped blue markings on her belly that are similar to those of a Togepi. She is able to use a form of active camouflage by enfolding her body with her glass-like coat of down and refracting light in unique ways, allowing her to become invisible or even take on the appearance of a human.
Latias is highly sensitive to the emotions of people and can telepathically communicate with them. She rarely makes contact with people or other Pokémon. If Latias senses any hostility, she ruffles the feathers all over her body and cries shrilly to intimidate her foe. Like Latios, Latias is highly intelligent. Latias has been occasionally sighted in small herds of several members, although she is unable to breed in the video games.
Latias`s only anime appearance was in the fifth Pokémon anime film, Pokémon Heroes. Latias also appears in the non-Pokémon-exclusive video game Super Smash Bros. Brawl appearing in tandem with Latios as Pokémon appearing from Poké Ball items.
Latias can be found in Pokémon Sapphire after completing the Pokémon League. She is found on a random-encounter basis, similar to that of Raikou, Entei, and Suicune in Gold, Silver, and Crystal. She can also be found in Emerald after completing the Pokémon League, but in Emerald, the player`s mother tells him or her to watch a TV news story, which explains that a Pokémon (its name cannot be heard) has been seen. This gives the player a choice of capturing either Latias or Latios. Latias can also be obtained via the Eon Ticket, given to the player after attending a Nintendo promotional event for Pokémon Ruby.</description>

<description>Latios is the male Eon Pokémon. They are a blue and white, dragon-like, legendary Pokémon with small arms and feet, and spiky fighter aircraft-like wings on their back. They appear to have white flesh underneath their blue carapace. They appear extremely similar to Latias, only blue, and more angular. It is said that by folding their arms close to their body, they can fly faster than a jet. Latios are all male.
Latios` intelligence allows them to understand human languages. They have a docile temperament and dislike fighting. A Latios will only open his heart to a trainer with a compassionate spirit. Their signature attack, Luster Purge, may reduce the target`s special defense. Like Latias, Latios can also render themselves invisible.
Latios, along with Latias, have a starring role in the movie Pokémon Heroes as guardians of Altomare, a city modeled after Venice, Italy. At the end of the film, Latios sacrifices himself to protect Altomare from a tremendous tsunami. It is notable that Latios marks the first actual Pokémon death in the anime series so far (the imaginary Entei and Celebi do not count). This may have been the fact that Latios is based on Jesus in characteristics.</description>

<description>Kyogre is one of a trio of legendary Pokémon, alongside Groudon and Rayquaza. Kyogre represents Pokémon Sapphire and appears on the cover art for the game. Kyogre represents the primal force of the oceans; as such, it has the power to bring forth storms, constant rain and massive floods. It is part of the creation myth of the Pokémon world. According to legend, a titanic battle between it and Groudon created the oceans and the land, and the two were sealed beneath their respective elements. Despite being the creator of the oceans, Kyogre still came and helped Manaphy when it needed help as any other regular Pokémon would. Kyogre is similar to an orca or killer whale. It is a Water-type with the ability Drizzle, which makes the weather rainy until another weather move is used or a Pokémon with another weather altering ability is switched in.
In Pokémon Sapphire, Team Aqua tries to awaken and control Kyogre. It is awakened by a blue orb that the group actively seeks. They eventually awaken Kyogre, but they are stopped by the player in the video games. Kyogre made its first movie appearance in the ninth Pokémon movie, Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea. In the movie, Kyogre helps Ash, May, Pikachu, and Manaphy to protect the Sea Temple and defeat The Phantom.</description>

<description>Groudon is one of a trio of legendary Pokémon, alongside Kyogre and Rayquaza, that represents Pokémon Ruby and appears on its cover art. In the legend surrounding the three, Groudon represents the land, while Kyogre and Rayquaza represent the sea and the sky, respectively. Groudon, representing land, raised lands and expanded continents in legend. Coming as a savior for humans suffering from floods caused by Kyogre, it can dissipate clouds, and evaporate water with light and heat. After a titanic battle with Kyogre, it went to sleep in underground magma, causing volcanoes to erupt when it awakes. It is a Ground-type with the Drought ability, which makes the weather sunny until another weather move is used or a Pokémon with another weather-altering ability is switched in.
Groudon first appears in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire and Pokémon Emerald along with Kyogre and Rayquaza. Pokémon Ruby focuses on Team Magma awakening Groudon to take over the world, while Pokémon Emerald has both Groudon and Kyogre awake. The anime follows a similar structure, where both Pokémon are awakened, and forced to battle by Team Magma and Team Aqua. This is foiled by Ash Ketchum and Lance, and Groudon and Kyogre return to their respective elements after calling a truce. Groudon also plays a pseudo-role in the sixth Pokémon movie, Jirachi Wishmaker, where an evil being in the form of a Groudon is formed from the energy of Jirachi.</description>

<description>Rayquaza is one of a trio of legendary Pokémon, alongside Kyogre and Groudon, that represents Pokémon Emerald and appears on its cover art. In the legend surrounding the three, Rayquaza represents the sky, while Kyogre and Groudon represent the sea and the land, respectively. Rayquaza resides within the ozone layer of the Earth and has lived there for hundreds of millions of years without ever descending. To those who have observed Rayquaza from the surface of the planet, Rayquaza has always appeared to be a zooming meteor. Rayquaza feeds on water and particles in the Earth`s atmosphere. It is said to only descend from the ozone layer if Kyogre and Groudon were to fight, in order to end the feud and maintain the balance of nature.
In Pokémon Emerald, Rayquaza is seen in a series of cutscenes. Once the player progresses past the Magma and Aqua Hideouts, Kyogre and Groudon wake up and start fighting, with the Red and Blue Orbs unable to control them. It is eventually sought out at the Sky Pillar, and eventually forces the two to cease their battle. Rayquaza appears as a boss character in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games, where the main team has to fight it in order to have it annihilate a falling star hurtling towards the planet.
Rayquaza is featured in the seventh Pokémon movie, Destiny Deoxys. Four years prior to the main events of the movie, Rayquaza is nearly injured in the ozone layer by the passage of a meteor containing the essence of Deoxys. Rayquaza seemingly destroys the Deoxys afterwards, but it is eventually revived. Rayquaza goes after it again, but after being rescued by it, Rayquaza decides that it isn`t an enemy, and returns to the atmosphere.</description>

<description>Jirachi a legendary Pokémon that first appeared in the Nintendo games Pokémon Ruby and Pokémon Sapphire. It possesses telepathic and telekinetic abilities, including the ability to levitate. Jirachi hibernates for periods of one thousand years in a crystalline cocoon. If it is ever in danger, it will fight its attacker, but not awaken from its slumber. After one thousand years have elapsed, Jirachi awakens from its sleep for one week if it is sung to in a pure voice. During this period, it is able to make wishes. If a message is inscribed onto one of the "tags" on Jirachi`s head, it will fulfill those wishes. After it fulfills the wishes, Jirachi returns to hibernation in a newly-formed cocoon, waiting another thousand years for its next master`s wish.
Jirachi is one of the primary characters of the 6th Pokémon Movie, Jirachi Wishmaker. Tomiko Suzuki, in her final role, portrayed the character in the original Japanese version. Jirachi awakens for seven days, awaiting a wish to be granted. It soon befriends Max, and travels with him until it is used to create an evil being in the form of a Groudon. It absorbs the power used to create the beast, and returns to sleep.
While Jirachi was still in its slumber, it reached out to Max. Max became fast friends with Jirachi after it awakened, and helped it break free from Butler`s machine, which was used so that Butler could awaken Groudon with the use of the Jirachi`s powers. Jirachi awakens only once every thousand years, and Max was really sad when it went back to its slumber.</description>

<description>Deoxys (pronounced /di`ɑks.ɪs/) is a Pokémon formed from a mutation of a extraterrestrial virus exposed to a laser beam. It has psychokinetic powers and a high intelligence along with a crystalline organ on its chest that acts as its brain and shoots lasers. It has the ability to transform into four different forms, each with a specific purpose: Normal, Attack, Defense, and Speed. In the third generation of games, the form is based upon the game the Deoxys is contained within. As of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, it can freely change by interacting with the four meteorites in Veilstone City.
Deoxys` name is based on "Deoxyribonucleic acid", or DNA, which is the base of all life and contains instructions for every part of it.
Deoxys first appeared in the seventh Pokémon film, http://anidb.net/a2371 [Pokémon: Destiny Deoxys]. In the film, it demonstrated the ability to switch between its forms, create shadow copies for use as drones, regenerate missing body parts, launch an aurora into the sky, and erect a city-size force field which keeps nearly every sort of machine within from operating. The film also demonstrated that Deoxys is not a one-of-a-kind unique species like Rayquaza; more than one Deoxys is seen.
In early 2005, NASA began a cross-promotion with Nintendo and the Pokémon Company to provide an "edutainment" program for children across the United States by Internet, teaching the science behind various Pokémon characters as they appear in Trading Card Game expansions. In the first segment of the program, based on the newly-released EX: Deoxys Trading Card Game expansion, they used the character of Deoxys to teach children about outer space, anatomy of a virus, the meaning of DNA, the existence of the ozone layer, and a definition of an extraterrestrial. Since then the program has had two other segments covering the next two expansions: EX Emerald and EX Unseen Forces.

<description>Torterra is the final evolution of the Turtwig evolutionary line. Despite their great size, these Pokémon are peaceful in nature and enjoy being with others of their own kind, preferring to bask in sunlight as they do not like to fight. When immobile, they look as if they are part of the ground upon which they rest, not as though they were a sleeping Pokémon. Because of this appearance, there are occasions when small Pokémon will gather and build nests on the shell of a stationary Torterra. When Torterra do move, they often move in herds in search of water. Paul`s, (Ash`s Sinnoh rival`s), original starter Pokémon was a Turtwig that evolved into a Torterra.</description>

<description>Chimchar is a small chimpanzee-based primate with orange fur. It is the Fire-type starter for the Sinnoh reigon. The flames on their rears are produced by burning gas in their stomachs. Chimchar also has a swirl-like symbol on the chest. The flames do not go out in the rain, and, unlike the tail flames of Charmander, those of Chimchar go out when they go to sleep.
Chimchar makes its first Pokémon anime appearance in the first episode of the Diamond and Pearl series, "Following a Maiden Voyage!", where it is shown as one of the three Sinnoh starter Pokémon in Professor Rowan`s lab. Paul, one of the rivals of Ash in the series, has a Chimchar he found in the wild. Paul later abandons Chimchar after a poor showing in a battle, and Ash asks it if it wants to join his team. Chimchar accepts.</description>

However, when the two "vines" that are on top of Budew`s head open up, a big spot can be seen on each vine (one that is blue and the other being red). As a matter of fact, the two vines are actually what will be the Pokémon`s flower-holding arms when it evolves into Roselia. Budew also appears to be wearing a green bib.

<description>Buneary are based on rabbits. Their fur is mostly brown, with accented, lighter areas on their ears, feet, and underbelly. The lower half of the body has cream-colored fur resembling a cloud. The ears can be rolled up like buns and deliver punches. Dawn catches a Buneary in the episode "Setting The World On Its Buneary". It can jump higher than 2 meters and apparently has a crush on Ash`s Pikachu.</description>

<description>Purugly is the evolved form of Glameow. It is a grey-and-white creature that resembles a feline with a rather large body and short legs. Its two whiskers are bent at the ends. Wild ones are known to be brazen and will attempt to invade another Pokémon`s nest on sight. A Purugly`s head, like its previous evolution, Glameow, resembles a crescent, though the purple-tipped ears have a fringe at the end.
It is exclusive to Pokémon Pearl, where Glameow is used by many of the members of the Team Galactic antagonists; Galactic Commander Mars uses a Purugly. These Pokémon are surprisingly quick for being so robust. As to confirm a Glameow`s transition from slender to fat during evolution, a Glameow with the Limber ability will exchange it for the Thick Fat ability during evolution. A Purugly can also have the Own Tempo ability, which prevents confusion.</description>

<description>Bronzor resembles a circular mirror with two yellow eyes in the center. Bronzor have no gender. Small spherical knobs line its perimeter in a hexagonal formation, also making it look like a tambourine. It also looks like a clock, as said in the Pokémon Handbook by Scholastic. It also has a tree-like pattern on its back, which can only be seen when it is caught and sent out in battle or when the player looks at Bronzor`s gender difference page in the Pokedex (obtained at a certain point in the game) after meeting one. This design resembles ancient bronze mirrors from East Asia. The creature was introduced in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, where they can be found at Mt. Coronet, Wayward Cave, and Route 206. Both Bronzor and its evolution have poor Speed, Attack, and Special Attack, but extremely high Defense and Special Defense.</description>

<description>Happiny are an exclusively female Pokémon that resemble Nurse Joy, with 3 round curls on their foreheads and a ponytail on top of their hair. The resemblance to Nurse Joy is probably linked to the fact its evolved forms (in the anime at least) work with Nurse Joy. Happiny like to carry egg-shaped objects in their pouches, imitating Chansey and Blissey, the Pokémon they may eventually become. This behavior is more than just play, however; a Happiny will evolve if it holds an Oval Stone upon leveling up during the daytime. In the Pokémon Diamond and Pearl games, Trainers are given a Happiny Egg to hatch and care for as they tour Hearthome City, home of Sinnoh`s Contest Hall. More Happiny can be hatched if their evolved forms hold Luck Incense during the breeding process in Solaceon City.
Happiny first appeared in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. In the episode "All Dressed Up With Somewhere To Go", Brock acquires an egg, which later hatches into a Happiny in "One Big Happiny Family!" there are rumours on internet forums saying that Happiny may evolve into Chansey and that this may bring about the end of Brock`s time on Pokemon breeding and traveling with Ash and co. If this was to happen then perhaps Max from the Hoenn series may return as the "informer" character having begun his own Pokemon journey. This however has no factual basis and is just a theory.</description>

<description>Croagunk uses the poison sacks in its cheeks to communicate with others. Its move Poison Jab has a tendency to stun Pokémon and people. Male Croagunk differ from female Croagunk in that the white bands on their chests are lower than in the female, as well as the black band on both arms. Croagunk and its evolutionary form, Toxicroak, are a combination Poison/Fighting type, making it weak against Psychic moves, Flying moves, and Ground moves, but strong against Grass moves, Fighting moves, Poison moves, Dark moves, Bug moves, and Rock moves.
In the anime, Team Rocket leaves a Croagunk in the episode "Gymbaliar". Brock later befriends it and captures it. It has been known to use its Poison Jab move on Brock when he expresses interest in any woman. It takes the role of Misty and Max. It is a powerful fighter and only known losses were to Paul`s Torterra and Dawn`s Aipom, though it fought many Pokémon before it under Jessie`s control without rest.</description>

<description>Lickilicky, known as the Licking Pokémon, is one of several Pokémon of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl that evolve from a Pokémon from a previous generation, Lickitung. It does so when it knows the move Rollout and levels up, but only in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. This fact makes it one of only four Pokémon (the others being Mamoswine, Tangrowth, and Yanmega) that evolve from a previously obtainable Pokémon in a way that would have been possible in previous games: by learning a certain move. Not much else can be discerned from Lickilicky`s pre-evolved form, except it can learn Explosion, meaning that it is the only Pokémon (besides Smeargle through its unique Sketch move) that can learn Explosion and receive a Same Type Attack Bonus from it as well. It has a bizarre, rather swirly protusion on its head resembling hair. Lickilicky also has thumb spikes, and a white bib-like pattern on its chest in front of the neck. This design may be based on old 60-70`s diner mascots.</description>

<description>Tangrowth, known as the Vine Pokémon, is the evolution of Tangela as of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl when Tangela learns the attack, Ancientpower, paralleling Yanmega`s and Mamoswine`s evolutions. Tangrowth, like Tangela, is mostly covered in thick, curly blue vines. As with Tangela, its white eyes are visible beneath them. It has thick, black legs with rounded pink feet. It also has two long, viny arms with three fingers each. Females tend to have more red on the fingers. Tangrowth uses its arms to trip prey. It also doesn`t mind if its arms get torn off by enemies, because they soon regrow. Tangrowth`s vines also seem to have morphed together, whereas Tangela`s vines are all completely separate. Tangela must learn AncientPower in order to evolve in Tangrowth.</description>

<description>Gallade, known as the Blade Pokémon, is a human-like Pokémon that seems to be the masculine counterpart to Gardevoir. This Pokémon can only be a male, evolving from a male Kirlia when exposed to a Dawn Stone. The crest on its head is reminiscent of the helmet of a hoplite. Sharp, green, spear-like blades extend from Gallade`s elbows, which Gallade uses skillfully and powerfully in battle. These blades can be retracted into Gallade`s elbows when not in combat, possibly so that it does not somehow manage to hurt those it is close to. As its evolutionary line and Gardevoir resemble elegant female dancers, Gallade may be a dancer as well. If true, Gallade may be based partly on a traditional Brazilian dance called Maculelê, which involves dancing through expressive and athletic motions and a form of sword play. Gallade are valiant and noble fighters, adept at both melee combat and swordplay. They are noble in the sense that they follow strict codes of manners and conduct in and outside of battles. This sense of honor can be compared to that of a samurai`s or knight`s. Their behavior is quite similar, in that a Gallade, as well as a Gardevoir, will protect its trainer, even if doing so could end its life. Their names are based on the word "gallant" and "blade", which represents them in many ways.</description>

<description>Manaphy, known as the Seafaring Pokémon, made its debut is in the 9th Pokémon anime film, Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea, and is thought to be the "Prince of the Sea" Pokémon alluded to in the title of the Japanese movie. It was the sixth Pokémon of the fourth generation to be revealed by CoroCoro magazine. It was revealed alongside the silhouettes of three other Pokémon: Mantyke, Buizel, and Chatot.
Many years ago, a Phione accidentally laid a mysterious, bright blue egg with a red heart inside it. It eventually hatched into a smaller Phione, which was named Manaphy. Many Phione began to worship it and Manaphy became the "Prince of the Sea". When bred with Ditto, Manaphy is able to produce more Phione.
Manaphy are blue blob-like Pokémon. They have two long antennae extending from atop their head. At the end of these antennae are round objects that resemble a ball. Manaphy can use their antennae to use Heart Swap and switch people`s energy. They also have jewel-like markings on their stomachs, one large red gem and a very small yellow gem. They are said to live in cold waters, and migrate miles away from their homes only to return. Manaphy can mimic human language as the Manaphy in Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea was able to say certain words and sentences.
Manaphy is only obtainable through a Nintendo Event, or by completing Pokémon Ranger and defeating the special Manaphy mission, which will only become available after the player inputs a password. This password has been revealed by Nintendo on numerous occasions.</description>

<description>Team Rocket is a highly organized criminal syndicate "in pursuit of evil" headed by Giovanni (called "The Boss" by his underlings) and based in Kanto. Its main focus is in stealing or capturing, then selling, rare and/or strong Pokemon, but it also conducts cruel experimental research on Pokemon. According to the Generation II games, the Team Rocket Oath says: "Steal Pokemon for profit. Exploit Pokemon for profit. All Pokemon exist for the glory of Team Rocket." Team Rocket`s final goal is to take over the world using Pokemon.
In the anime, Team Rocket is based in Kanto, with many smaller branches reaching out in Kanto and Johto. Giovanni is the Gym Leader of Viridian City during the early part of Ash`s journey. There is also an underground school for training aspiring Team Rocket members. In addition, Team Rocket had its headquarters near Pallet Town and Viridian City, but this was destroyed by Mewtwo in its rage; it is unknown where the headquarters are now. All that is known is that the headquarters are now in a large building built at the end of a canyon and guarded by many grunts, seen when Jessie, James, and Meowth returned from the Hoenn region to report back to Giovanni.</description>

<description>Jessie is one half of of the Team Rocket duo that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokemon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
Jessie`s mother, Miyamoto, was a high-ranking Team Rocket agent. When Jessie was around the age of three, Miyamoto left on a mission to the Andes Mountains to record the voice of the elusive Pokemon Mew. However, Miyamoto disappeared, and Jessie was put into a foster home which had very little money. There were times when she had no choice but to eat snow because of a lack of more nourishing food.
When she was old enough, she left home to become a Pokemon nurse in Jouto. However, the school she was enrolled in was literally for Pokemon nurses (i.e. Chansey), so she failed to graduate and left, leaving behind a Chansey she had befriended there. It is assumed that she then traveled back to Kanto, where she enrolled in Pokemon Tech, a trainer`s school, met James, and subsequently failed and dropped out. After this, Jessie and James joined a bicycle gang in Sunny Town, where Jessie was known for swinging a chain above her head as she rode her bike (nicknamed "Chainer Jess").
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between Jessie and James after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Sometime before joining Team Rocket, and it is not known when, Jessie obtained a Contest Pass in the Hoenn region. Also during the years before Team Rocket, she had several boyfriends, all of whom left her and/or treated her badly. In "Xatu the Future", she revealed that she had once worked at a T.V. station as the Weathergirl. In "From Cradle to Save" is also revealed that she once was a ninja.
She has a long-standing bitter rivalry with Cassidy, another member of Team Rocket. Another member, Wendy, held a grudge against Jessie for failing to pay for a drink (making Wendy pay), but got her revenge when she added the charge to Jessie`s overall Team Rocket bill.
In the episode "Ignorance is Blissey", Jessie was reunited with her friend Chansey from the Pokemon nurse school; Chansey had since evolved into a Blissey.
Starting in Hoenn, Jessie has become a Pokemon Coordinator, entering every contest that she could. She frequently makes it to the battle round, but usually loses there. However, in "Borrowing on Bad Faith", she finally succeeded in winning an (unofficial) contest by using Ash`s Aipom, which she had saved earlier in the episode. And, in "Team Shocker!", she finally wins an official contest with her Dustox in at Solaceon City. Later she also won a ribbon with help of her Yanmega. She has Contest Passes to compete in the Hoenn, Kanto, and Sinnoh regions.
While Jessie`s role in the Pokemon anime has not yet ended, in Toshihiro Ono`s manga, "The Electric Tale of Pikachu", she ended up married to James and with child.
Jessie seems to have a special preference for snake-like Pokemon, owning both an Arbok and a Seviper. In "The Ninja Poke Showdown", she expressed a preference for Poison-type Pokemon in general.
For unknown reasons, she, James and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation.
In the Kanto contests, Jessie disguises herself as Jessebella (which is similar to James former fiancee Jessiebelle) wearing a red dress and glasses. Eventually, Ash, Brock, Max and May finds out her true identity at the last contest.
During the Kanto Grand Festival, Jessie dresses up as Jessadia (Japanese: キャンディ・ムサリーナ Candy Musalina). and wears glasses, long white socks, a yellow and orange dress, and has her hair in pigtails. She works there as an announcer and Lilian Meridian`s assistant; Lilian herself says she may not really like "Jessadia"`s style, but recognizes her talent. In the Latin American dub, she enters Super Contests under the name Jessiebella (referencing Jessiebelle again). Jessie currently still continues to use the Jessalina disguise while participating in Super Contests.
In "Pruning a Passel of Pals!" and "Strategy With a Smile!" she once again used her Jessadia disguise to report on the Wallace Cup.
Although Jessie had entered mostly every contest in Hoenn &amp; Kanto, she lost in every single one, whether it was the first match of the Battle Rounds or the finals. But in the Sinnoh Region, she has so far won 2 ribbons using her Dustox and Yanmega.</description>

<description>Meowth is a very unique Pokémon as it has many of the characteristics of a human. It walks on two feet, talks and is as smart as any human. Meowth is currently a member of Team Rocket and he travels around with Jessie and James trying to capture Pikachu and other rare Pokémon for Giovanni.
Meowth generally finishes his sentences with "Nyaa (ニャー)" which is the equivalent of "meow" in English. This helps people remember that despite his ability to talk like a human, he still has cat character traits.
Meowth is also known for coming up with his many schemes to try to capture Pikachu. While Jessie and James always agree with Meowth and think his plans are brilliant, they are generally foiled by Ash and his friends.
Long Con to Access Raimon City Pokémon Center
Meowth schemed with Jessie, James and Doctor Zager to figure out a way for them to infiltrate the Raimon City Pokémon Center where high-leveled Pokémon are stored in a vault that is protected by a security machine scan system that would only open if Nurse Joy (Isshu) or Nurse Joy`s Audino were scanned. Meowth pretended to be no longer part of Team Rocket making up a story that his made an error while executing a certain operation and when headquarters hear of his mistake, they told him he was fired.
Ash, Iris and Cilan believed him and allowed Meowth to travel with him. Pikachu though didn`t trust Meowth even though Meowth proved on numerous occasion that it should be trusted. Meowth`s plan was put into action when they arrived at the Raimon City Pokémon Center and as soon as Nurse Joy`s Audino was scanned to open the door, Meowth turned on Pikachu and the other and captured all the Pokémon in the vault. The long con had been a success and Meowth met up with Jessie and James below the Pokémon Center. Unfortunately, they weren`t able to get away as Ash and his friends realized that Meowth had just been conning them and they were able to stop Team Rocket.</description>

<description>James is one part of of the Team Rocket trio that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokémon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
James is mostly a comedic parody of bishounen characters; the English dub in particular tends to give him a melodramatic and even campy tone. He is somewhat famous for carrying a rose, though in more recent episodes he does not display it often. Mostly, his rose is displayed in the Team Rocket motto.
The only child of millionaires, James was forced to endure formal society. At a young age, he was forcefully engaged to a girl of whom he was terrified, Jessiebelle, all because his parents wanted to have a wealthy daughter-in-law. Thus, he ran away from home, leaving behind his beloved pet Growlie. He attempted to enroll in Pokémon Tech, a trainer`s school, but, along with his new friend Jessie, flunked out. Then, with Jessie, he joined the Sunny Town bicycle gang, where he was popular for being the only gang member to have to use training wheels (nicknamed "Trainer Jim"). Eventually James, Jessie, and the bike gang went their separate ways.
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between James and Jessie after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Since he is proficient in several activities, including Pokémon haiku and PokéRinger, it is possible that he developed his skills during his temporary separation from Jessie, but this is not known for sure.
In the episode "Holy Matrimony!", James returned to his home as a result of a trap by his parents, who pretended to be dead. He was reunited with his old pet Growlie and managed to avoid marrying Jessiebelle. Growlie stayed behind when James returned to Jessie and Meowth.
James has a tendency to be swindled by a Magikarp Salesman, who has on many occasions tricked him into buying a Magikarp or other useless Pokémon and items for large sums of money.
James also has a tendency to cross-dress, but has not done it since "Pros and Con Artists". He does, however, dress up like famous celebrities as well, such as Professor Oak, Juan, and Norman.
James loves rare bottle caps and has an impressive collection of them. In the episode "All That Glitters!" it is revealed that he has "drunk enough soda pop to float an aircraft carrier".
For unknown reasons, he, Jessie and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation. However in newer episodes the balloon is shown with `jets` attached to explain how they get from one place to another faster than walking.</description>

<description>The Beginning
Ash is the main character of the Pokémon anime. Raised in Pallet Town, he started his journey to become a Pokémon Master at the age of 10. On the day that he started his journey, Ash carelessly woke up late despite being told by his mother, Delia Ketchum to get to bed. He rushed to Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory only to find out that the beginner Pokémon - Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander - had already been given out to trainers who arrived on time. However, Professor Samual Oak mentioned that there was one more Pokémon available - Pikachu. Despite constantly hitting Ash with Electric-type attacks and refusing to return to its PokéBall, Ash decided to take Pikachu along with him on his journey to become a Pokémon Master. Pikachu is cold towards Ash at first and laughs at his failures; however, when Ash saves Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow, he begins to warm up to his new trainer and the two finally become friends. After the battle with the flock of Spearow, a Ho-Oh is seen flying towards a rainbow in the sky. The PokéDex reveals that the Ho-Oh is an unidentified Pokémon. Thus, the journey of Ash and Pikachu begins.
Captures in Viridian Forest
While making his way towards Pewter City and his first Kanto League Gym Battle, Ash came upon a wild Caterpie deep within Viridian Forest. Instead of using Pikachu to battle against the wild Pokémon, Ash took his chances and threw a PokéBall without weakining the Caterpie first. Luckily, he was able to catch the Pokémon without any trouble. The capture of Ash`s Caterpie marked Ash`s first capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Caterpie the second Pokémon to join his team.
The next day, while continuing the trek through the Viridian Forest, Ash came up on a wild Pidgeotto. He tried to just throw a PokéBall like he did with Ash`s Caterpie, but Pidgeotto swatted the PokéBall away. Misty informed that he must weaken the Pokémon first before attempting to capture it. He called out Ash`s Caterpie to battle against, but Misty quickly informed him that Bug-type Pokémon are weak against Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeotto. After Pidgeotto dealt significant damage to Ash`s Caterpie, Ash recalled it and sent out Pikachu. Pikachu was able to use its Thundershock to weaken Pidgeotto and allow Ash to capture it with a PokéBall. Thus, this capture marked Ash`s second capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Pidgeotto the third Pokémon to join his team.
Later on, while still in the Viridian Forest, Ash was approached by Team Rocket, who attempted to steal his Pokémon. After defeating Meowth, James`s Koffing, and Jessie`s Ekans, Ash`s Caterpie evolved into Ash`s Metapod.
Some of Ash`s greatest accomplishments have been at the various Pokémon Leagues. He was the victor at the Orange League and the Battle Frontier. He also competed in the Indigo League and the Johto Silver Conference where he placed admirably in both those competitions as well.
Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup
Ash participated in the Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup at the Kagome Town stadium. In the first round he was in the fifth match and faced off against Marris. The match was quickly showcased and Ash won the battle and advanced to the second round while Marris was eliminated from the tournament.
The Isshu League
Ash participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where he was matched up against Trip. Trip`s Serperior was sent out to battle Pikachu and Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior`s speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter Trip`s Serperior speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round. The two met in the Pokémon Center after the battle, and Trip vowed that the next time they met that he would win. The two shook hands and parted ways.
In the first main round, Ash`s opponent was shown on the match up electronic board but not much else is known about the battle. Ash`s Scraggy participated in the second main round of the Isshu League tournament where it faced off against a Darumakka. It was able to defeat it so that moved on to the next round.
In the third round, Stephan was matched up against Ash. Cilan noted that the two of them have a very direct taste and that it would be a good battle. It was only a 3 on 3 battle but the both of them gave it their all. The first two battles of the third round setup the final match up of Stephan`s Sawk vs Ash`s Krookodile, both of which were very injured from the previous battles. Both of them did their best to muster up their reserve strength but in the end a surprise move of Aerial Ace by Ash`s Krookodile was super effective against Stephan`s Sawk and it knocked it out to give Ash the victory while eliminating Stephan from the tournament. Stephan realized after the battle that the reason that Ash withdrew Waruvial after the first battle was because Ash knew that Stephan would definitely send out Dageki, so he didn`t reveal that it knew Aerial Ace and saved until the end.</description>

<description>The Beginning
On the morning that Ash was to start his Pokémon journey, he woke up late and by the time he reached Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory, all of the beginner Pokémon were already taken. However, Professor Samual Oak did have one Pokémon left, a wild Pikachu. At first, Pikachu did not like Ash and would refuse to enter his PokéBall. He would often laugh at Ash`s failures and refused to listen to him. However, after Ash proved his loyalty to Pikachu by protecting him from a flock of Spearow, and thus began to earn Pikachu`s trust and respect. The two have since become best friends and Pikachu never leaves Ash`s side.
Since the day Team Rocket first encountered Pikachu, it has been their sole goal to capture it. Day after day, their plan to capture Pikachu has been thwarted mainly due to Pikachu`s amazingly powerful Thunderbolt that keeps on blasting them off.
On numerous occasions, Pikachu has made it evident that he is happy being a Pikachu and has no desire to evolve into a more powerful Raichu. It has proven time and time again that it is a powerful and worthy opponent to any Pokémon that dares to battle it.
Gym Battle against Burgh`s Leavanny
Pikachu was then sent out to battle Burgh`s Leavanny. Burgh`s Leavanny managed to tie up Pikachu with String Shot but unlike Ash`s Swadloon who was able to break free, Pikachu ended up getting hit with a couple of Leaf Storm attacks and a Hyper Beam before it rolled into another of Burgh`s Leavanny`s Leaf Storm attacks to break the string off its body so it could attack. Freed from the String Shot, Burgh`s Leavanny tried to tie it up again but Pikachu managed to avoid it with its speed and then knocked Burgh`s Leavanny out with a combination of Iron Tail and Electro Ball.
Gym Battle against Elesa
Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy and was then matched up with Pikachu. Pikachu made quick work of Elesa`s Emolga and knocked it out with one attack, its Iron Tail.
Elesa`s Tynamo was the last Pokémon that she used in her gym battle against Ash. It was matched up against Pikachu who had just defeated her Emonga. Pikachu had a hard time defending against the fast Tackle attack that Elesa`s Tynamo kept hitting it with but Pikachu used its Thunderbolt to create a large dust cloud leaving only a small corridor for Pikachu to focus on it and so Elesa`s Tynamo couldn`t maneuver out of the way. Pikachu one hit K.O`d Elesa`s Tynamo with a Iron Tail. The loss gave Ash the overall victory.
Battle against Alder`s Bouffalant
Ash challenged Alder to a battle and he accepted though he had been walking all night and was actually quite tired. Alder sent out his Buffron to battle Pikachu but just as the battle started, Alder fell asleep standing up and didn`t give any orders to his Buffron. Alder`s Bouffalant stood still as Pikachu began hitting it with attack after attack until it Alder`s Bouffalant finally got mad at Alder and charged at him and set him flying into a tree. After that, Alder`s Bouffalant no longer wished to battle and Alder conceded the battle.
Gym Battle against Skyla
In Skyla air battle simulation, Ash`s Tranquill was matched up against Skyla`s Unfezant and since her Pokémon was the highest evolved form, she determined that her Pokémon would be the winner in that match-up. In the actual gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was up against Skyla`s Unfezant which was the match-up just after Ash`s Tranquill had defeated Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla`s Unfezant proved to be stronger and faster than Ash`s Tranquill, so Ash recalled it and set out Pikachu. Pikachu had a definite advantage over Skyla`s Unfezant with its electric attacks and it quickly knocked it out with its Electro Ball attack.
Ash Just after Pikachu ended up knocking out Skyla`s Unfezant, Skyla`s Swanna was sent out to battle against it. Skyla had been watching her grandpa`s battle videos and noticed that he used the move Aqua Ring to defend against Electric attacks. She used that same defense against Pikachu which nullified its Electric attacks. It`s Iron Tail also couldn`t hit it so high in the air. Ash then noticed the rings in the air and Pikachu jumped up on them and managed to hit Skyla`s Swanna but not directly. Pikachu was now up in the air though and Skyla`s Swanna had the advantage there and it quickly knocked Pikachu out with a powerful Brave Bird attack.
Battle Against Trip`s Serperior at the Isshu League
Pikachu participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where it is was matched up against Trip`s Serperior. Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it.

After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round.</description>

<description>When Ash and co. were traveling towards Daybreak Town for Dawn`s next Pokémon Contest, a mysterious Pokémon Trainer specializing in martial arts, named Clayton, challenged Ash and his Buizel to a battle after seeing how Buizel saved Gible who had fallen into a river. Clayton`s Mr. Mime proved to be a really strong opponent, though, as it managed to dodge Buizel`s Aqua Jet and SonicBoom attacks by skillfully using its Psychic and Double Team moves, eventually knocking Buizel out with a powerful ThunderPunch. Ash and Buizel, determined to make up for the loss by getting stronger, started training with Clayton`s help so that Buizel could learn a new move; Ice Punch. He told them that, in order to master the move, they had to work on improving their speed and concentration.
At first, the progress of Ash`s Buizel`s training seemed to be really slow. However, after training overnight using unstable and light objects as targets for its punches, like floating leaves, Buizel managed to master the move completely. After the completion of Buizel`s training, Ash challenged Clayton to a rematch, and Clayton accepted. Ash`s Buizel proved to be more of a challenge for its opponent, Mr. Mime, this time and after activating its ability, Swift Swim, in the midst of the battle due to a sudden rain, Buizel managed to increase its speed and finish Clayton`s Mr. Mime off with a powerful Ice Punch. Clayton then acknowledged Ash`s Buizel`s improvement and praised its skills, but also put emphasis on the fact that Buizel still had a long way to go and had to keep on training.</description>
