<description>On a sunny spring day, the road to the shrines of Kumano are crowded with pilgrims traveling to the shrines. Among the pilgrims are an elderly monk and his young acolyte. As the evening comes, they stop to ask for a room at a lodge along the way. The mistress of the house is a young widow. She immediately falls in love with the acolyte, and slips into his room that night. The young monk feels attracted to her, finding it difficult to resist the temptation, he lies his way out of the situation by pretending that he will return in three days, on his way back from Kumano. When the woman realizes that the monk has tricked her, she sets out to find him. Urged by his master, the young monk flees, escaping by boat over the rough waters of the Hidaka River. The woman chases after him in a frenzy, and the depth of her passion transforms her into a huge white serpent, a symbol of jealousy and passion. The monk seeks refuge in the monastery at Dojoji Temple, where the wise old abbot hides him inside a huge bronze bell, and bars the doors as they await the arrival of the serpent...</description>

<name>elements</name>
<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>past</name>
<description>Anime that takes place in the past or clearly seems to take place in the past in case of an alternative universe. This category should almost always go together with one of its sub-categories, because the past can either be a depiction of a historical event(s) or not, in which case it would be alternative past.</description>

<name>stop motion</name>
<description>Stop motion (also known as stop-action or frame-by-frame) is an animation technique to make a physically manipulated object appear to move on its own. The object is moved in small increments between individually photographed frames, creating the illusion of movement when the series of frames is played as a continuous sequence.</description>

<name>puppetmation</name>
<description>A puppet is an inanimate object or representational figure animated or manipulated by a puppeteer. It is usually (but by no means always) a depiction of a human character, and is used in puppetry, a play or a presentation that is a very ancient form of theatre. The puppet undergoes a process of transformation through being animated, and is normally manipulated by at least one puppeteer.
There are many different varieties of puppets, and they are made of a wide range of materials, depending on their form and intended use. They can be extremely complex or very simple in their construction. They may even be found objects. As Oscar Wilde wrote, "There are many advantages in puppets. They never argue. They have no crude views about art. They have no private lives".</description>
