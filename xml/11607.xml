<recommendations total="2">
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="446680">I strongly suggest watching it after you play the game. It will work like a nice addition to the game. If you watch it before playing, you`ll spoiler yourself around 20% of the game (`cause characters are introduced slowly, and this anime shows 5 of them in 20 minutes).
If you view it as addition to the game, its good (with some flaws, but that`s OK) - nostalgic soundtracks, voices, characters, all that.
Dont try to watch it as a standalone thing.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="393830">This special provides some background to certain events (and a related short side-quest) that only receive cursory mention in the game. For those playing, the events take place shortly before the third palace. It`s definitely not essential viewing, but neither does it do much to spoil the game - for those who have yet to play it, it provides a brief preview of what to look forward to, and for those who have played it, you get a short "Aha!" moment when you realize how it fits in. Anyone who fits in either category will likely find some enjoyment to be had.

For those with no interest in ever playing the game itself, I would steer clear, since its main draw comes from how it relates to the game, so you`re likely to get vet little out of it.</recommendation>

<description>Morgana is a mysterious cat-like creature whom Ren and Ryuuji first encounter in the dungeons of Kamoshida`s Palace, when they inadvertently stumble into it on what should have been Ren`s first day at Shuujin Academy. He teaches them the ins and outs of the Metaverse, Palaces, and Personas. He later appears to them in the real world as an ordinary domestic cat. Only people like them who have been able to enter the Metaverse can hear him speak in the real world, everyone else just hears him meowing. His true origins are a mystery even to him and he works as one of the Phantom Thieves in mostly in an attempt to seek answers, though he is convinced that he must have once been human. In the Metaverse he can also transform into a van which the Phantom Thieves can ride.</description>

<description>Amamiya Ren is the protagonist of the story. Originally coming from an unspecified small town, after intervening in a street altercation between a drunk man (who turns out to be the powerful politician Shidou Masayoshi) and a woman, he is convicted of assault, expelled from his former school, and sentenced to one year of probation. He is ordered by the court to transfer schools, with Shuujin Academy in Tokyo being the only one that would accept him with his criminal record. He is made to stay with Sakura Soujirou, who begrudgingly gives him a place to stay as a favour for Ren`s parents, who are acquaintances. As he serves out his sentence of probation, he begins to awaken to strange powers that might enable him to avert the coming ruin that is about to fall upon the world.</description>
