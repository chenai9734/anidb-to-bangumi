<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="281953">Not as good as manga, but still worth watching if you like romantic things.  Many things are missing and characters development is cut a lot and sometimes you get differnt imperssions cause of that.

PS Wanted to notice that 13-th episode is ridiculously retarted and has nothing to do with manga. And for the moment when Yamato runs away from house I would gladly broke face of the idiot who thought up this bullshit.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="51585">Very solid shoujo. It could`ve been even better, but it`s still good and enjoyable. I thought it was a lot better than Kimi ni Todoke, which I thought was too naive and slow. At least in this show the people have some kind of resemblance to real people.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="748358">This romance series was overall decent. The plot - an ostracized girl who develops a relationship with a bishounen - is not that original, but still effective to make things take off in its initial stages. After that, as others have said, comes the drama, which is very subjective: some may find it childish and exaggerated, others may find it touching and others just alright, and I guess that it depends on the viewers` experience both with anime and with real-life relationships. Objectively speaking, animation was good, but I was not a fan of it, as I felt it was overly complicated and detailed. Character development was decent and voice acting was was good, featuring industry veteran Kayano Ai as the female lead. Its conclusion was open, but still satisfying - somewhat.

All in all, a decent, but understandably polarizing, romance anime. Recommended for fans of the genre.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="76529">I really liked this anime, reminds me of Honey and Clover, though not as deep. ED song especially.
For fans of romantic anime, willing to go with all the things that come with that category. Entertaining, heartwarming sometimes and "get to the next episode" some others.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="780947">thought this was a pretty decent romance imo it would have been much better if they just removed megumi sooner or altogether should have used those last episodes focusing on one of or all of the three relationships we actually cared about. still it was enjoyable and i thought the opening and ending songs were good too which is always a plus for me</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="432184">It does really one thing, but does it really, really well: romance. There are some sad moments but thanks to that the happy ones feel really happy. It`s amazing how much story and backstory they managed to put into only 13 eps, and yet you don`t feel it being overly rushed nor slow. It really is a worthy watch which I enjoyed to the very end!
P.S: There isn`t really any "gainax bounce", this title is a little more mature.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="502713">it was overall very good (8/10), I don`t think I`ve watched an anime with so little annoying stuff in it in years. Yes there was an annoying character (Megumi), and a few unrealistic scenarios but just barely.

And they kissed in the very first episode !!! none of that they-might-hold-hands-by-the-last-episode bullshit most romance anime pull (the 2nd to 6th kisses were a little rapey though).
Although that did make the romance parts of it less intense, there is no 12 episode build-up, but then again we get to see so much more past it and that`s far too rare.

It`s a far more realistic and adult version of romance, but that doesn`t make it lose any of it`s charm or innocence. This is only like the 3rd or 4th `Must see` recommendation that i have ever made and i don`t give those easily.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="416965">This anime is similar to but different from kimi ni todoke; the characters aren`t as dull and the story has a faster pace. If you like real-life and the romantic genres, you will surely like this one as well.</recommendation>

<name>horny nosebleed</name>
<description>In Japanese media, healthy young men who have no other sexual outlet will often suffer nosebleeds upon seeing the naked female body, or even just a pair of well-filled panties.
The nosebleed is, of course, a visual shorthand/euphemism for sexual arousal. It is commonly interpreted that way for males and females, with little trickles of blood indicating mild arousal, and gushing fountains of blood indicating erection/extreme arousal in both sexes. It can also be interpreted as shorthand strictly for erections in males. In that case, when blood shoots from the nose explosively, and in ridiculous quantity, the implication would be an ejaculation.

<name>domestic cat</name>
<description>The cat (Felis catus or Felis silvestris catus), also known as the domestic cat to distinguish it from other felines and felids, is a small, usually furry, domesticated, and carnivorous mammal. Cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt vermin and household pests, and are often kept as indoor pets, in which case they are also called housecats; they have been associated with humans for at least 9,500 years and are currently the most popular pet in the world, being found almost everywhere on Earth.
Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with light, strong and flexible bodies, excellent hearing, sense of smell, and near darkness eyesight, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. They are skilled predators and hunt over 1,000 species for food. Despite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species, with communication means that include pheromones, body language and a variety of vocalizations, such as meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<name>school life</name>
<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<name>important haircut</name>
<description>When a character cuts off his or her hair, it often symbolizes a rite of passage or bout of character growth. A princess striking out on an adventure, or a new recruit at boot camp, for instance. Hair is something that takes time and effort to grow, so parting with it voluntarily can be a powerful act.
This is particularly a big deal when women get haircuts. Yet in fiction, even an accidental hair slicing can leave a character with a surprisingly even cut.
In many religions (Western Christianity, Ancient Egyptian religion, and others) priests and/or monks cut/shave their hair. Roman Catholic nuns also tend to cut and mantain their hair short under their veils when they enter the nunneries. The cutting of one`s own hair is also a part of Buddhist mythology, specifically something done by Siddhartha himself early on in his path to enlightenment, so anime examples might draw from this as an allusion. There are also some cultures, including Native American and many Asians, where a person would cut his or her hair as an act of grief, disgrace, or even rebellion. In the Confucian tradition, hair (like the rest of your body) is considered a gift from your parents and may not be damaged without a very good reason. Furthermore, prisoners and psychiatric patients commonly have their heads shaved, often to prevent the spread of lice, but sometimes also as a demeaning measure.

<name>first love</name>
<description>Ah… first love. The love that is remembered the most fondly by the participant, as this is commonly what people experience when they first have a first crush, but it is also the love before the Second Love, if that should ever happen, and for a guy, he usually holds her memory very close to him if he is a widower whereas for young girls, the memory of the First Love they ever had is a special memory to them, especially if he later becomes the boyfriend they`ve longed for.

<description>Someone who has been rejected or excluded from the majority, or all of the social groups in an area (school, work, etc.). A person that does not fit in society.
They typically look slightly high or depressed and they are usually alone most the time. Some are alone because they are too snobbish and see themselves above everyone else. Others are alone because they want to be. 
They are usually the victims of every negative stereotype and rumour. Some might even be called “freaks”.</description>
