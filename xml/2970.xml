<name>PIC NEEDS IMPROVEMENT</name>
<description>This entry has a poor picture and needs to have it replaced by a higher-quality alternative. Causes may include: it is too small; its colours or lighting are bad; it has excessive compression or other encoding issues; it is from non-anime sources (anime/char); the face is hard to see (char/creator); the hair/eye/skin colours do not match the anime (char); it does not represent their usual appearance (char); among others. If you can, please swap a better picture in and remove this tag. Thank you.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Driving involves driving in a competitive manner. Note that just driving to get groceries does not suffice, unless one does it like Takumi Fujiwara in Initial D.</description>

<name>development hell</name>
<description>Due to unforeseen circumstances, the production or release of this anime has been pushed back, stalled, or cancelled one or more times from when it was first announced.
While some of them have eventually been completed, others might have only had a trailer released or have been changed into another format (e.g. a TV series turned into an OVA).
Common reasons for a work to become stuck in development hell include creative differences, legal issues, financial problems, scheduling conflicts or the death of an involved creator.</description>
