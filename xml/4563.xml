<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="247340">Great story, great action... overly fanboyed. Really enjoyed this but I would recommend (if you have not seen it already) that you read the manga instead. Give it a watch if you have read the manga, though.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="199844">*First, check to see if we share similar anime tastes.* If you enjoy battle-of-wits anime, then you might enjoy this one. Very clever writing had me drawn into the story as opposed to the usual anime lure of non-stop boobs, guns, and explosions (which I still enjoy [I`m only human]).</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="468468">Very good, still somehow in the middle i got board.
NOT because it was bad, or not exciting enough, or anything like that.
It just became so predictable. Really. I was not suprised by anything that followed after episode 14 or so.
Anyway it`s still definatly worth watching and I feel like you still would miss out on something if you never did. So that`s why i recommand it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="551809">Very strong thriller until about episode 25, when it quite simply falls off a cliff. The last ten episodes or so are a real disappointment.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="370136">An excellent series, cleverly constructed with great characters</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="101924">Even though the ending is not fitting for the quality of  the beginning, this is an anime I easily recommend  with smart characters and plot ( those who like action go see another thing, this is for the ones who likes smart character). ps. I recommend to watch until episode 26, then stop watching.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="302824">Excellent. Reminds me somewhat of Sherlock Holmes.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="605092">If you`ve ever considered watching an anime, it should be this one. School, evil, romance, and detective like mind games, with a complex paranormal undertone.  It`s masterpiece start to finish.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="143965">Death Note is an astonishing anime. Very unique in it`s theme and a MUST see for the ones wanting a more "mature" kind of anime. Must see! A splendid MUST SEE!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="391848">Thrills, suspense, mystery with a touch of the supernatural taken to great heights. I like detective stuff and adding a little supernatural flavor to it along with amazing twists and a very intelligent and cunning main character as a villain just made it absolutely incredible and entertaining.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="550869">The Definition of Masterpiece.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="484892">Death Note isn`t the most popular anime for no reason.  This anime deals with the main protagonist and his overall slide into mania because of his power to use the death note and "change the world for the better."  Overall, this anime is one of the best Thriller animes I have seen.  Also, don`t be discouraged by the fact that this was from Weekly Shounen Jump.  It may`ve been from a shounen manga, but the content of this anime is very Seinen.  So if you are looking for an excellent Seinen Thriller anime, then by all means watch Death Note.  I guarantee you you won`t regret it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="492032">YOU MUST WATCH IT !!! I think that is enough. This is my top favorite anime. You`ll just addict to it. I like the anime no matter wich episode and I think it`s the best. So definitely I recommend it as "must see".</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="510632">Definitely a great anime. Great tension, interesting characters and an engaging plot. 

Probably not for all, but it is so good that everyone should at least check it out. Though you should probably skip the last third because it becomes quite bad.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="271621">Its a mind blowing anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="400353">A must see</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="415427">The best anime ever created. A masterpiece beyond words.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="739815">Well written, great characters. Great plot. Great for everyone.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="558725">The only anime series that kept me as interested in the beginning as it did towards the end. Great plot and characters, graphics and music. Everything about it is perfect except the end, which in my opinion is a bit weak. Other than that it`s great. Too bad there aren`t many anime series like this one, but i guess that`s what makes it unique.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="526796">This is what you get if you bake Showtime`s Dexter and occultism in an anime-making oven.

Fun fact: While Dexter debuted some time after Death Note manga, both the series and the anime debuted only 3 days apart.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="481279">A witty thriller with a classical theme of hubris: a rarity by today`s standards.
This series keeps you guessing till the very end because you never know how things are going to go till they happen. Also the concept behind the "Death Notebook" is very intriguing and deep, making you think of how you would use it if you had one. Animation quality, music, and character development are also above par for sure.
A must see if you enjoy intelligent and/or dark animes.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="359130">The best anime that I`ve ever seen; that`s not an exaggeration either.  Love the storyline the most and the characters are awesome!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="834921">Excellent psychological-thriller for newfags and veterans alike.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="778565">That serie is anime 404, so i`d like to recommend this anime to people who loves genuis mc, and battle of intelligence.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="260239">ABSOLUTELY A MUST SEE FOR EVERYONE!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="5957">read the manga also it was amazing, a must see and read!</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="421194">Exiting Anime, with a complex story line that keeps going until the very end.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="344788">Just watch it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="298033">One of the absolute best anime! Very catching storyline.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="241399">Mindblowing! a must see for everyone and probably the best anime in recent history</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="22546">There really is nothing like Death Note. A psychological thriller and true battle of wits made engaging and surprising throughout. It has a mind-bending premise that truly makes you wonder what strategy the protagonist, if you can call him that, will think of next. The ending leaves a lot to be desired, due to some out of character events, but everything but the last few episodes is really great. Give it a shot and you`ll probably get hooked like I did.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="260880">It`s such so clever..-Which side are you with?</recommendation>

<description>Bored with his deteriorating world and the laconic way of his fellows, shinigami http://anidb.net/ch413 [Ryuk] drops his Death Note on Earth and watches to see if it stirs up anything interesting. His plan succeeds beyond his wildest expectations when the Death Note is found by brilliant high school senior http://anidb.net/ch301 [Yagami Light], who is also bored with a world he considers rotten.
Although initially he regards the book as a prank, Light soon discovers, through experimentation, that the book`s claim is true: picture a person in your mind as you write the person`s name in the Death Note, and that person dies 40 seconds later of of a heart attack (although a different time frame and manner of death can be specified). Armed with that power, Light sets out on a quest he sees as noble: make the world a better place by eliminating all its criminals using the Death Note.
Soon cast as the mysterious "Kira" (a Japanese pronunciation of the English "killer") in the media and on the Internet, some take exception to his playing god, most notably the police and the enigmatic master detective http://anidb.net/ch299 [L], who resolves to do everything in his power to stop Kira. Light counters by doing everything in his power to prevent people from identifying or interfering with him, even if that means getting rid of people investigating him.</description>

<name>insane</name>
<description>Insanity, craziness, or madness is a spectrum of behaviors characterized by certain abnormal mental or behavioral patterns. Insanity may manifest as violations of societal norms, including a person becoming a danger to themselves or others, though not all such acts are considered insanity; likewise, not all acts showing indifference toward societal norms are acts of insanity.
In modern usage, insanity is most commonly encountered as an informal unscientific term denoting mental instability, or in the narrow legal context of the insanity defense.
A more informal use of the term insanity is to denote something or someone considered highly unique, passionate or extreme, including in a positive sense. The term may also be used as an attempt to discredit or criticise particular ideas, beliefs, principles, desires, personal feelings, attitudes, or their proponents, such as in politics and religion.

<name>detective</name>
<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<name>university</name>
<description>Since college/university students are typically at least eighteen years old, with stories covering mature everyday life topics, you will find the college setting quite often in seinen and josei anime.
Topics that can now be covered - as compared to High School settings - are higher education (i.e. coping with higher intellectual stress), the more adult party life (i.e. alcohol, smoking, sex), the issues of daily life vs. studying - especially when having to work to pay for bills, and finally the possible friction between those in and out of college.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>The thriller is a genre of fiction in which tough, resourceful, but essentially ordinary heroes are pitted against villains determined to destroy them, their country, or the stability of the free world. The hero of a typical thriller faces danger alone or in the company of a small band of companions. The protagonist may be a law enforcement agent, a journalist, or a soldier, but typically he or she is cut off from the resources of "their" organization. More often the hero is an ordinary citizen drawn into danger and intrigue by circumstances beyond their control.

<name>mundane made awesome</name>
<description>Sometimes normal just doesn`t cut it. Eating: you put food in your mouth and chew. Playing sports: you throw a ball around. You need to make it awesome, no matter how mundane it is.
Let`s throw in some gripping orchestral music, lighting changes, different camera angles, something! Don`t write like a man, write like an evil overlord! Exaggerate your expressions and gestures, speak with excessive intonation, and if all else fails, throw in some close-ups, slow motion, and ominous Latin chanting! With practice, even you can turn something like eating chips into an epic battle of light and dark, blinding the viewer with sheer awesomeness.

<name>just as planned</name>
<description>A term usually used to describe a situation, where a seemingly smart and cunning villain sets up a plan that seems grand and impressive, but is actually long winding, ridiculous, and convoluted. And all of that just to trick his opponent(s), like the hero or anybody else, into doing things exactly as he planned. Suffice to say that the villain could have reached his goal by much shorter and easier means, it just wouldn`t seem as awesome anymore.
The phrase is also known as the original Japanese "keikaku doori" where keikaku stands translated for "plan" or "schedule", and doori for "in accordance with ..." or "following ...".
The phrase is a reference to http://anidb.net/ch301 [Yagami Light] from http://anidb.net/a4563 [Death Note], and his love for plans.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A calm and stoic character that appears in the second half of the series. In the anime and manga versions, Near is a primary candidate to become L`s successor and calls himself N during the course of his investigations. He shares a number of similarities with L. Much like how L plays with things such as sugar cubes and forks, Near is frequently shown playing with toys or hair, and he is constantly shown sitting in an unusual manner. After L`s death, he was asked to join forces with Mello, who refused (it is explained that Near lacks the emotional insight to beat L, while Mello is too emotional and impulsive). Near then gained the support of the Government of the United States and formed the Secret Provision for Kira (SPK). In the `extra` manga story, set after the end of the series, Near states that, while he respects Light`s drive for justice, he can never find his `Kira` actions excusable. His real name is Nate River.
In the film L: Change the World, L grants the name "Near" to a Thai boy who is a mathematical genius; L intends for Near to succeed him.</description>

She returns later in the story as an announcer of NHN chosen by Mikami to be Kira`s spokesperson to the world. Light eventually romances her in order to covertly deliver messages to Mikami, and have her use pages of the Death Note to judge criminals as part of Light`s plan. Takada dislikes Misa and suggests to Light that he should kill Misa on several occasions.</description>

<description>Ryuk is the main Shinigami of the Death Note series. Bored with the activities (or lack thereof) of the Shinigami realm, Ryuk obtains a second Death Note and drops it in the human realm for someone to find, hoping to amuse himself. He deliberately writes the instructions on the front page (in English, which he assumed to be the most popular language in the human realm) so people would understand its purpose. The Death Note is discovered by Yagami Light, and Ryuk follows him around for much of the series to see how Light uses it. Ryuuk has a fairly humanoid appearance. His skin is grey, or a purple-ish colour and his limbs are abnormally long and he has bulging yellow eyes with red irises.</description>

The Shinigami Gelus, who had fallen in love with Misa, sacrificed himself to kill her destined murderer. In doing so he was reduced to dust, leaving only his Death Note. Touched by this act, Rem delivered Gelus` Death Note to Misa, since it was her life he saved. Her appearance is quite skeletal, with long, spinal cord-like arms and bone-like skin.</description>

<description>Gelus appears in a flashback when Rem explains how to kill a Shinigami. He is a small, doll-like Shinigami whose appearance suggests that he was poorly sewn together from mismatched fabric. He only has one eye, despite having two eye sockets.
In the flashback, Rem recalls Gelus watching over a younger Amane Misa in the human world. Knowing that it was Misa`s final day, she watches with him. Having fallen in love with Misa, Gelus uses his Death Note to kill Misa`s destined murderer, against Rem`s protests. Gelus is reduced to a pile of dust as punishment for extending a human life, leaving behind only his Death Note. Rem delivers his Death Note to Misa because it was her that he saved. In the film, he simply drops it and it lands near Misa.</description>

In order to regain his Note, Sidoh agrees to help Mello`s gang against Near`s SPK and the Kira investigation team. He wears heavy clothing, obscuring most of his features, and his head is wrapped in bandages.</description>

Seeing Light and Misa`s reactions to it, L intervenes and announces that he no longer suspects them of being Kira, although he is still suspicious over the fact that Misa`s DNA was found on the audio tapes. Misa is released, but Light continues working on the Kira case. L and Watari move the investigation team`s headquarters to a new building inside the city. Elsewhere, Rem speaks to a mysterious businessman about the Death Note. Eight businessmen then plan the next murder Kira will commit in order for the Yotsuba Group to excel in the market.

He finds evidence that Kira is in the building, but, before he can act, he is apprehended by the eight businessmen. Using the fake identity card Watari gave him, he passes himself off as Misa`s manager. He pretends to offer a deal involving her in their commercial campaign, while contacting L using his modified belt buckle. Following L`s instructions, he then fakes his own death. In one of the Group`s later meetings, one of its members chooses to leave out of fear he may have to face the consequences of Kira`s actions.

Light and L come up with a plan to contact one of the members of the Group, Reiji Namikawa. Namikawa agrees to act as a spy and help postpone Kira`s killings by discussing them at the meetings. L reveals that he still suspects Light is the first Kira by playing mind games with him. Afterward, L questions Misa and wants her to infiltrate the Yotsuba Group to obtain information. Soichiro worries that even if they do gather enough information on the Group it will be difficult to capture all of its members at the same time.

<summary>The third Kira sets his eyes on Misa after meeting her. While Misa is taking a break from meeting with the Yotsuba Group, Rem contacts her. Misa is able to see the shinigami, but her memories of being the second Kira do not return upon touching a portion of the Death Note that Rem has brought her. Rem then tells Misa about everything that has happened and that she must trust Light lest she be killed. Upon re-entering the room, she spots who the third Kira must be: Kyosuke Higuchi. Misa goes on a date with him and is able to obtain proof that Higuchi is the criminal L is looking for. Her ease in determining who Kira is leaves L very suspicious, since he could not deduce it himself.

He points out that this will be an advantage in curing society of Kira and proving that he has been caught. He arranges for Sakura TV to air a "Kira special" where Matsuda will declare he knows the identity of Kira to lure out Higuchi. Having been granted immunity from prosecution, several of the businessmen trick Higuchi and lead him to follow L`s plan. As the third Kira races to the television station, determined to kill the whistleblower, L and the investigation team watch his every move via cameras and wiretaps.

L wonders if Higuchi is talking to a shinigami. Rem convinces Higuchi to go to the station, but she has her own selfish motives for doing so. Higuchi enters the station`s offices and writes Matsuda`s fake name in his Death Note. The team thinks he has just written a note to himself, but find his subsequent erratic behavior odd. L argues that Higuchi has attempted to use his killing method. Higuchi then makes the deal with Rem to obtain shinigami eyes. A furious pursuit ensues when L realizes Higuchi can kill after looking at a person`s face and orders the police to apprehend him.

<summary>Higuchi is arrested on grounds of being Kira and causing multiple murders in the region of Kanto. Inspecting Higuchi`s Death Note, L discovers that shinigami do exist. While L is stunned, Light takes the Death Note from him and remembers that he is the original Kira. Light then kills Higuchi by writing his name on a scrap of the Death Note. It is revealed that when Light gave away his Death Note, he added a fake rule stating that, after having written in the book, its owner must continue to use it at least once every thirteen days or perish. The investigation team reviews the rules written in the book and finds that they can do little to get rid of it. Meanwhile, Light orders Misa to recover the other Death Note he had hidden a few months earlier. Misa makes a second deal with Ryuk for the shinigami eyes in order to find out L`s true identity.

<summary>L asks Rem about Death Notes, but she reveals as little information as possible to avoid implicating Light or Misa. Meanwhile, Misa begins to use her Death Note to kill criminals. Although Light denies Misa`s involvement, L becomes suspicious of her and Rem realizes that it was Light`s plan all along to endanger Misa so that Rem would sacrifice himself to kill L. Later, Light finds L on the roof of the investigation team headquarters. The latter laments how distant he is from other people and how often they, like most people, lie. When the two rejoin the rest of the team, L reveals that he is planning on testing the thirteen day rule, the only thing currently absolving Misa. Before he can do so, however, Rem kills Watari and L, and herself in the process. After secretly snatching away Rem`s notebook, Light celebrates his victory in silence.

<summary>The first half of the episode features L narrating the events of the first 25 episodes. This account of the Kira case is revealed to have been left behind by L as a record of his achievements as a detective. It is deleted by Light when he discovers it. The investigation team appoints Light as L’s successor and agrees to not publicly announce L`s death. Light learns to wield the power he has inherited, while resuming his executions as Kira. The show jumps ahead in time five years, depicting Light joining the National Police Agency (NPA) of Japan in 2012, at the age of 23. Five years earlier, shortly after L`s death, L`s computer is shown automatically notifying an elderly man of L`s fate. The man then reveals this information to two children.

<summary>Orphanage caretaker Roger Ruvie informs L`s true successors, Mello and Near, that L has died. Relinquishing the opportunity to succeed L, Mello leaves the orphanage to pursue Kira on his own, backed by the American Mafia. Near allies himself with the President of the United States. Along with Steve Mason of the FBI, he forms an organization whose goal is to catch Kira, the Special Provision for Kira (SPK). Mello eventually abducts the director of the NPA and demands the Death Note under Light`s task force`s possession as ransom. As soon as Light discovers this, he kills the director. Mello then decides to kidnap Light`s sister, Sayu. While scrambling to find a way to rescue Sayu, the investigation team receives a phone call from Near, who reveals that he knows of L`s death and that someone has attempted to replace him.

<summary>Near suggests that he and Light cooperate to rescue Sayu. Soichiro takes the Death Note to the exchange point chosen by the kidnappers in Los Angeles, but Mello`s men hijack the plane he is on and drop him off in the middle of the desert. Light monitors his father via satellite, until he enters an underground facility. There, Soichiro exchanges the Death Note for Sayu. Most of the SPK members die soon after Mello grabs hold of the Death Note. Near then proposes to Light that the two cooperate completely in the future and shares his suspicions that Mello is behind these deaths and is playing a game to see who can catch Kira faster. Meanwhile, in the shinigami realm, a shinigami named Sidoh tells another, Armonia Justin, that he lost his Death Note. Justin informs him that it was stolen by Ryuk and dropped in the human world. He advises Sidoh to go retrieve it.

<summary>Light uses the Death Note to have a member of Mello`s Mafia mail him the address of their hideout. Sidoh sees the address and goes to find Mello. Meanwhile, Light informs Ryuk that he will give up ownership of his Death Note and borrow Misa`s. The next day, Misa, posing as Kira, calls the investigation team to tell them that she will give them her Death Note. She also tells them that most of the members of Mello`s mafia will die on November 10 and that that will be the best time to find the stolen Death Note. Upon receiving the second Death Note, Soichiro makes the deal with Ryuk to obtain shinigami eyes. The investigation team storms Mello`s facility on the set date. Soichiro comes face to face with Mello and reads his true name: Mihael Keehl. Before he can write it on the recently recovered Death Note, however, Soichiro is shot. Mello escapes the rest of the investigation team by detonating explosives and Soichiro is taken to a hospital, where he dies comforted by the knowledge that his son cannot be Kira because he can see Light`s lifespan. Light returns Sidoh`s lost Death Note to him.

<summary>The President of the United States declares America`s neutrality regarding Kira in Sakura TV`s program "Kira`s Kingdom". Meanwhile, a deeply scarred Mello uses SPK agent Halle Lidner as hostage to gain entrance into Near`s headquarters and meet with him. Mello wants the picture Near has of him so that he will remain safe from Kira. In return, he tells Near about shinigami and that some of the Death Note`s rules are fake. Already suspicious of Light, Near proposes to the investigation team that they test the "thirteen day" rule, but none of them believe that they should. In response to Near`s actions, Light contacts the President of the United States, asking for information on the whereabouts of the SPK and threatening to kill him if he does not cooperate. Later, Hitoshi Demegawa, the host of Sakura TV`s show, goes to America as Kira`s messenger and gives a worldwide broadcast inciting people to break into the newly found headquarters of the supposedly evil SPK.

<summary>Demegawa commands Kira`s followers to break into the SPK headquarters in New York, while Misa watches the scene on television, waiting to kill Near as soon as he exits the building. Near asks the Japanese investigation team to consider that Light may be Kira. He and the remaining SPK members then escape the building by dropping buckets of money out of the windows to distract the protesters. Aware that his team is beginning to doubt his identity, Light e-mails Misa with a new plan. Meanwhile, Aizawa offers Near information about the past investigation that leads Near to conclude that Light is Kira. Aizawa then tells Light that he would like to resume surveillance on Misa and him to help clear their names. Light does not object. Demegawa appears on television soon after, asking Kira`s followers to donate money to build a temple to worship Kira. Disgusted that Demegawa is exploiting the situation, Light has Teru Mikami, the new owner of Misa`s Death Note whom Light selected based on his appearances in "Kira`s Kingdom", kill the television host. Back at the investigation team headquarters, Aizawa realizes that with both Light and Misa under observation, the new killings cannot be attributed to either of them.

<summary>Tragic events in Teru Mikami`s childhood convince him that God wants him to stand up to evil. As a result, when criminals everywhere begin to die, Mikami believes that this is God`s righteous judgment and becomes a frequent guest on "Kira`s Kingdom". After Light gives him a Death Note, Mikami becomes ecstatic and passes judgment on criminals in Light`s stead. He chooses a new spokesperson for Kira: Kiyomi Takada, who happens to be one of Light`s girlfriends in college. Light realizes that he can use this connection to his advantage and sets up a meeting with Takada, presumably for the benefit of the investigation. While the two meet, Takada receives a call from Mikami and Light reveals himself to Mikami as Kira. They create a ploy to force the investigation team to remove all bugs from the room, after which Light tells Takada that he wants her to be his goddess in the new world. Light then tells the investigation team that he will be pretending to be Takada`s boyfriend to catch Kira. Elsewhere, Mello watches Misa, suspecting her to be the second Kira.

<summary>Near goes to Japan, allegedly as bait for Kira, and Light silently accepts the challenge. Near ponders on how to beat Light, knowing that the one who is doing his will has shinigami eyes and that the two communicate via Takada. Following Light`s instructions, Takada asks Mikami to send her five pages of the Death Note. She tells him that he will continue his work in a fake book made to look like the real one. While walking to a broadcast, Misa runs into Takada and rushes her, jealous that she is not the most popular star. Halle Lidner, who has been sent by Near to act as Takada`s bodyguard, stops her then, but Takada meets with Misa for a girl-to-girl talk soon after. Lidner sits in with them. By the end of the conversation, Takada is convinced that Misa is stupid and Lidner reports to Near about the love triangle between Light, Takada and Misa. Elsewhere, SPK member Stephen Gevanni confirms that Mikami is the new Kira, after watching him kill a man by writing something in a notebook.

<summary>After Gevanni`s report, Near decides that they must get close to Mikami, but carefully so that the shinigami trailing Mikami will not warn him of their presence. Meanwhile, Aizawa marks several notepads before Light and Takada meet, to determine whether or not they are communicating in secret through written notes. Takada tells Light of her meeting with Misa. Annoyed at the trouble that both women cause him, Light assures her that she is the only one for him. He then writes a script for Takada that makes it sound like she has agreed to help capture Kira. After the meeting, Aizawa`s suspicions are confirmed. The SPK picks up Misa then and, when Light contacts Near to tell him that they have lost track of her, Near informs him that he has her. Meanwhile, Gevanni searches Mikami`s locker while the man is doing machine flyes and finds the notebook. During a second visit, Gevanni takes photographs of the names written in it. Near determines that the handwriting is Mikami`s. Now having everything he needs, Near sets his plan in motion.

Prepared to face such an event, however, Takada kills Mello by writing his name in a piece of the Death Note she managed to secret away.

<summary>Each having developed a strategy to bring the other down for good, Light and Near finally meet face to face in an abandoned warehouse. Light brings out Mikami to have him write the names of everyone but Light on his Death Note. Meanwhile, Near is confident that the pages of the notebook Mikami is using are fake, confessing that he has tampered with them. All they need do now is check whose name was not written to find out who the real Kira is. Light struggles to mask his glee as he thinks of how he already knew of Near`s actions and that that had been why he had Takada keep the real Death Note while switching Mikami`s with a false one. As the seconds before the Death Note`s power takes effect count down, Light declares his victory to Near.

<summary>Mikami`s Death Note fails to work and Near confesses that he knew about the fake notebook and had actually tampered with the real one. Mikami is restrained and, faced with Near`s undeniable evidence, Light breaks down and laughs like a madman. He confesses that he is Kira and attempts to write names down on a piece of the Death Note hidden in his watch. Matsuda keeps him from doing so by shooting him down. Seeing Light writhe on the floor in agony, Mikami kills himself. Wounded, Light escapes in the middle of the commotion. He goes over everything that has happened in a series of flashbacks. As he had promised in the beginning of the series, Ryuk writes down Light`s name in his notebook, thinking that this whole experience has been quite fun. Misa is shown standing on top of a skyscraper, before Light finally dies of cardiac arrest on a set of stairs, seeing L`s figure in front of him.
