<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="184212">The last couple of anime aired recently, I have missed a main charactor I could relate to. Kiritsugu is both good and bad and his background story defines who he is. All the charactors in the series are well defined, but Kiritsugu should take the medal as the best main charactors of the year.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="442226">It is indeed a great show and is a must-see if you`re a fan of the gerne. I still recommend it though, because it`s worth watching, even if you are not exactly into it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="764835">First class series love the heroic figures and the contest to `win the holy grail` between them and their summoners.  The whole spectrum of personalities and characters is in here, some you will like other`s you will despise as it should be in a well written story.

I`ve read the other posts and agree with most of what they say about this series, but for me the ending is what disappointed me the most, I would not have chosen that outcome out of all the possibilities it was a let down.  Other than that it would have been `must see anime` instead I give it a strong recommendation.

So many people have picked Saber as their favorite hero, she`s a great choice but I Loved Rider, he is someone I would like to sit down with and have a beer.:)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="376567">Reminded me of what good anime is really about. Best show in a very long time. Ufotable + Yuki Kajiura FTW!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="468468">So i normaly don`t do "must see`s" but Fate/Zero ( MUCH MORE then Fate/Stay Night, which is just boring compared to Fate/Zero.. ) is for me an amazing masterpiece which stands all the way on the top. 
Whatever else used to be up there for me, from every genre, really just got stomped into the dust by Fate/Zero. Seriously. Wow. 

ATTENTION: The violance is probably on the same level as it was with Hellsing Ultimate, so i would only recommand it for adults, no family stuff...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="185992">Simply put this series is unbelievably fulfilling. It is riddled with overwhelming twisted sick irony, chaos and madness beneath the surface. You actually progressively develop genuine interests in ALL the characters and how their stories play out. They arent just cannon fodder to the series or to be used simply to further the plot. You end up rooting for every character and their aspirations whether they are good or evil. Its a clash of compelling ideologies opposed to your usually hero vs villain. What is good and bad is questionable as many of them appear gray. This series is powerful with substantive weight to leave a lasting impression on you.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="71577">Pure awesomeness. Mostly action driven, epic, great conclusion. `Nuff said.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="481279">WOW!! A beautiful end to a beautiful series!

Just when you thought it couldn`t get better with the first season, Season 2 comes around and blows your mind! The character development gets deeper, the action gets more intense, the animation continues to amaze, the plot becomes more profound as it gets closer to the end, and best of all, the ending is absolutely beautiful--especially if you`ve seen Fate/Stay Night! Honestly, I tried watching F/SN right after this and barely finish it (literally, it was painful to watch again!). After Fate/Zero, F/SN is now nothing more than a pathetic, amateur-hour anime in my opinion. Everything F/SN offers just pales in comparison to F/Z.

An absolute must watch if you enjoyed F/SN! just be sure to watch the 1st season first.
[FYI: if you want to know how the 5th Grail War goes in light of F/Z, watch the "Unlimited Blades Works" movie.]</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="545232">Great Anime !, U will never feel bored, story is Ok, but the plot is great ! , U should see it :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="1057">I honestly have no words to properly describe this anime. I have seen every good anime in existence; My list being headed by Junni Kokki. So, I don`t say this lightly - This is one of the finest works of animation ever created.

There is no amount of negativity that can bring this anime down from its lofty position. I expect there will be one or two movies that will fill in the gap between episode 24/11 and 25/12 though.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="481845">For all who complain that the ending was not satisfied. Sorry but this story MUST end this way. Fate/Zero is a question which Fate/Stay night answers. If you haven`t watch FSN yet, watch it or read the novel and stop complaining about the ending.
This is a very good adaption from the novel although the story was dramatically simplified but i think it is inevitable because of the limited time for each episode. The art and the soundtrack are awesome and the action scenes are epic.
You cannot miss this even if you are a Type-moon fan or not.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="31168">If there`s one Blu-ray collection to get this year then this is the one. The visual quality of Fate/ Zero is by far the best I`ve seen. The music is beyond epic, and the story, is a story worthy of kings! (Literally :P)

This tops the list of my favourites!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="384413">A marvel among TV anime, if only because of its high production values.

Serious dark story, great and charasmatic characters, majestic OST, epic and amazingly animated fights, and actual strategies are just a few of the things Fate/Zero has to offer. No matter if you`ve seen DEEN`s adaptation of Fate/stay night or not (which you shouldn`t even do in the first place) you shouldn`t pass Fate/Zero up. 

It`s the best Type-Moon adaptation - which says a lot, considering the usual tendency of [url=http://anidb.net/a1015]lackluster[/url] [url=http://anidb.net/a3348]Type-Moon[/url] [url=http://anidb.net/a6784]adaptations[/url] -  and one of the best overall works from them, even if it wasn`t written by Nasu Kinoko himself.

It`s a definite must see, and a great gateway anime to the Nasuverse!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="447833">There are a few areas that could be improved upon, but overall this is an anime worth seeing. It has great characters, the battle sequences are stunning, the animation is beautiful, and the score is simply wonderful.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="430063">An anime which is deeper emo than Evangelion and has awesome graphic quality (even the aerial dogfight scene and the army of the king). AND even the sound, OST, BGM are the best quality.

Although there are some skipped scene from the novel, it doesn`t broke the plot itself, and You won`t get boring to watch this.
Only the anime hater maggot who hate this anime or underrate it.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on http://anidb.net/cr2442 [Urobuchi Gen] and http://anidb.net/cr927 [Type-Moon]`s 2006-2007 Fate/Zero novel, a prequel to Type-Moon`s much acclaimed Fate/Stay Night 2004 visual novel.
The Holy Grail War is a death-match between 7 magi (Masters) and their summoned heroic spirits (Servants). In this battle royale, the prize is the legendary Holy Grail, said to be an omnipotent wish-granting device which will produce any sort of miracle in order to bend reality to accommodate the wishes it grants. The winning Master and Servant shall be granted one wish each, after which the Holy Grail will not be activated until the next War.
As the 4th Holy Grail War progresses, several camps raise the stakes, and the challenges only become bigger and more difficult. Each Master and Servant will be faced with the impact of their own shortcomings, and some of the competitors would do well in remembering that deceit and betrayal do not send prior warning...

<name>vampire</name>
<description>A vampire is a mythological or folkloric nocturnal undead. Vampires use long fangs to penetrate the necks of people, usually young females, to drink their blood, both as a form of nourishment and to turn the targets into slaves.
In the classic vampire stories, they are thought to have no reflection in mirrors, are able to shapeshift into bats (sometimes also wolves or some form of fog), have unlimited lifespan and superhuman strength, reflexes and senses, and may only be killed by silver bullets, silver blades, a stake through the heart, fire, or exposure to sunlight; on the other hand, they cannot tolerate garlic, holy water, or Christian crosses (sometimes expanded to religious symbols in general).
In modern anime, these limitations are usually dropped, and they become far more powerful and fearsome opponents than usual. A human bitten, or sometimes even scratched, by a vampire typically becomes a slave, eventually dying as if poisoned, and becoming a vampire, ghoul, zombie, or other form of undead after death, often staying under the command of the vampire who originally bit them.</description>

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.

People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>magic circles</name>
<description>A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised.
Traditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for non-magical work such as meditation.
Generally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>neo-noir</name>
<description>Neo-noir is a style that prominently utilizes elements of the now declined film noir, but with updated themes, content, style, visual elements, or media that were absent in films noirs of the 1940s and 1950s.
Films noirs were typically crime dramas or psychological thrillers featuring a pessimistic worldview and starring conflicted antiheroes trapped in difficult situations and making choices out of desperation or nihilistic moral systems, with crime, especially murder, being featured on the majority of them. Some of the most obvious visual elements included low-key lighting, striking use of light and shadow, black-and-white filming, and unusual camera placement such as low-angle, wide-angle, and Dutch angle shots.
Film noir is often associated with urban settings, private detectives, femmes fatales, and bleak endings, but they are not necessary to the genre; a large number of these films, including some of the genre classics, take place in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road, feature neither character type, and have clearly happy endings.
Film noir and the early neo-noir would come to influence the formation of tech noir, a crossover of neo-noir and science fiction, in the late 1970s; some the most influencial tech noir works are the American movies Alien (1979), Blade Runner (1982), and The Terminator (1984). Tech noir itself would also help form http://anidb.net/t2861 [cyberpunk] in the early 1980s.</description>

<description>The long-term plot of the program revolves around a group of characters whose numbers are being slowly whittled away by one means or another, usually by killing each other. In the case of some reality shows, this is a process of elimination intended to result in a single winner. In other shows, this is a dramatic device, designed to generate tension and conflict with which to drive the overall plot of an episode or Story Arc (if any); in these cases it is sometimes combined with Anyone Can Die to especially heighten the resulting excitement, even when the apparent main character may be protected by Contractual Immortality. Compare Gotta Kill Them All.

While the Heroes Outrun the Fireball, Mr. Exposition might explain why the Evil Overlord`s death caused the explosion. The Action Girl can deliver impressive lectures on why the monster`s Achilles` Heel will work, while still engaging in Waif-Fu. The Superhero can quip to his heart`s content and explain his abilities while dueling one insignificant mobster, or deliver a Kirk Summation during the course of a single Finishing Move. Sometimes even apparent mere mortals can give a lecture on what is happening when it would be a much better idea to simply run like hell.

<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<description>Saber, an agile and powerful warrior. Known as the King of Knights, she maintains a high code of honour. Saber is loyal, independent, and reserved; she appears cold, but is actually suppressing her emotions to focus on her goals. Her class is considered the "Most Outstanding", with excellent ratings in all categories.
In Fate/Zero, though she and Emiya Kiritsugu are Servant and Master seeking the same ultimate goal of peace, their differing ideological perspectives result in a strained relationship where Kiritsugu does not directly acknowledge Saber. After Kiritsugu summoned Saber, he made Irisviel hide Avalon - which had served as a catalyst to the summoning - inside her body so to serve as insurance while she performed her act of fake Master. Irisviel`s and Saber`s role at the time was to openly take action and serve as a decoy in order to lure out enemies, while Kiritsugu worked in the shadows with his assistant, Hisau Maiya. Because Saber could not dematerialise her spiritual body, she disguised herself as a man while staying at Irisviel`s side.
In the Fate route, because her master Emiya Shirou cannot effectively provide her with Mana, she minimises her activity to preserve what she has. Saber is bewildered by Shirou`s "protective" tendencies, and believes his erratic and reckless behaviour jeopardise her chances of winning the Holy Grail War.</description>

It has many laboratories and research bodies that seek to advance the progress of Thaumaturgy, as well as institutions that transmit their secrets to the next generation. Although the emphasis lies on the pursuit of knowledge, the Association also seeks to increase its own military strength so it can defend itself against those that might threaten it, such as the Holy Church, other mystic organizations and supernatural forces seeking punish mankind for meddling with areas that should not be touched.

<description>The Holy Church, also referred simply as "the Church", is a worldwide religious organisation, apparently styled after the real Roman Catholic Church. It is a powerful faction in the Nasuverse, with several important characters in the `verse works being its active or former members. On the surface, they coexist rather peacefully with the http://anidb.net/ch1951 [Mage`s Association], but that is only out of necessity, and neither group will waste an opportunity to backstab the other. They sometimes act as arbiters in the Association`s internal disputes; one such example are the Holy Grail Wars. Aside their regular duties as a normal religious group, they have a few special agencies dedicated to supernatural events.
The Assembly of the Eighth Sacrament, the lowest among the Church`s special agencies, is charged with researching, recovering and managing Holy Relics, items considered to have the holy attribute, scattered around the world. Their name comes from the seven Sacraments of the Catholic Church. As the Holy Grail is a Holy Relic, they`re in charge of managing every Holy Grail that appears; as such, in order to watch over the Holy Grail War, the priest stationed at Fuyuki City is always a member of this agency and is the one who acts as the war`s Supervisor.
The Church is also very active and relentless in the pursue and elimination of heretics, beings acting in disagreement with the Holy Scriptures. The members of the Church in that line of work are called Executors, and their specialties include magus hunting, demon killing, and vampire slaying. Among them, the most powerful ones are members of the Burial Agency, a group always composed of eight Executors, one of whom is the leader and another of whom is not an acting member, but a backup. Members of the Burial Agency work alone, and they will act without orders if they deem necessary, even going as far as skewering bishops, which earned them the reputation of the most heretic group inside the Church.
Among the items the Holy Church uses for its purposes, one can find the many types of Keys of Providence, Conceptual Weapons used for purification, and the Holy Scriptures, very powerful Conceptual Weapons used only by a few select Executors. Examples of Keys of Providence are http://anidb.net/ch1916 [Kotomine Kirei]`s most used weapons, the Black Keys, sword-shaped items that can be thrown at an opponent in order to pierce them and that do not have a blade when inside the priest`s frock. An example of a Holy Scripture is the Seventh Holy Scripture, used by http://anidb.net/ch1941 [Ciel], a massive metal weapon which can kill a vampire through physical power alone, shoots Bible pages, has an unicorn horn for a bayonet, and has a http://anidb.net/ch31725 [residing spirit].</description>

<description>Cornelius Alba is a magus, an acquaintance of http://anidb.net/ch1887 [Aozaki Touko] from their days as students. They were on good terms until the day Cornelius came to the realisation that Touko was a better magus than he was. Even though he was popularly considered a better magus than her, he eventually became so obsessed with his inferiority that he occasionally becomes deranged when speaking of her. He joined up with http://anidb.net/ch3515 [Araya Souren] not because of the latter`s goals, but solely in order to kill Touko to prove his superiority. Though would naturally be more powerful than both Araya and Touko, he is blinded by his arrogance and is not nearly as versatile as they are.</description>

Though lacking in practical experience in the field, Waver, mostly in part due to his Servant, survives with Holy Grail War with little detriment to himself and develops a greater sense of perspective of the world.

<description>Toosaka Tokiomi is a magus specialized in the fire element. He`s a user of jewel magecraft and the head of the Toosaka family. He`s one of the Masters of the 4th Holy Grail War. He`s the father of http://anidb.net/ch35637 [Toosaka Rin] and http://anidb.net/ch35638 [Matou Sakura]. He is not particularly talented, and attempts to compensate that through training; still, his both daughters possess extremely rare talents. He is a prideful and arrogant man who keeps a good appearance and his calm at all times, believing that a magus may never fail to be elegant. He also believes in that which he calls "the path of a magus", which is a kind of noblesse oblige: he believes that the magus is a superior entity in comparison to regular humans, and as such has special, more important duties.</description>

<description>Kariya is the uncle of Shinji Matou and Master of Berserker. He is the only member of the Matou family who truly loves Sakura Matou like a daughter, and is upset that Tokiomi allowed his younger child to be adopted by Zouken. Kariya had previously left the Matou family ten years prior to the 4th Holy Grail War out of disgust for his own family, but returns and makes a deal with Zouken Matou that he will win the Grail War in exchange for Sakura`s freedom. Due to his lack of formal training, Kariya was implanted with the same magical worms as Sakura. This caused a number of side effects as the worms would literally eat away at their host, causing Kariya`s health to progressively fail in return for significantly expanding his magic circuits and magical potential. By the time of his summoning of a Servant, Kariya`s hair had turned white and the nerves on the left side of his face were dead. In addition, his natural lifespan had been shortened to such an extent that Zouken estimated he would only live on for one additional year. However, despite the Crest Worms and his own accelerated training, Kariya remained severely lacking as a Magus. At Zouken`s behest, he compensated for this by summoning the most powerful of the seven Servant classes, the Servant of Mad Enhancement, Berserker. However, the high volume of magical energy required to maintain Berserker causes him constant, excruciating pain.

Lancer possesses two Noble Phantasms: Gae Buidhe: The Golden Rose of Mortality, a short yellow spear which inflicts wounds that do not heal as long as the spear exists in the world, and Gae Dearg: The Crimson Rose of Exorcism, a long red spear which cancels mana upon contact, ignoring all magical defences and temporarily dispelling all magical attributes of the target struck.

<description>Rider`s identity is Iskander, the King of Conquerors, famous in history as Alexander the Great, who desires to defeat Saber in particular because he believes her ideals regarding kingship are delusional and that she would thrive as one of his followers. He derives his status as Rider from a set of divine bulls and chariot purportedly a gift from Zeus, known as Gordius Wheel: Wheel of Heaven`s Author, summoned when Iskander slices the air with his Sword of the Kupriotes. His eccentric and overbearing personality along with his incredible abilities creates difficulties for his Master and their opponents. He is notably the only Servant that Gilgamesh truly respects as an equal, the latter inviting him to challenge him in combat as many times as he wished. His first Noble Phantasm is Via Expugnatio: Distant Trampling Domination, the trampling attack used by the Gordius Wheel, which causes lightning strikes upon movement, inflicting massive damage to whatever is in its path. His second and most powerful Noble Phantasm is Ionioi Hetairoi: Army of the King, which is a Reality Marble, a self-contained miniature world that contains thousands of the most trusted of his soldiers who fought alongside him in life resurrected as temporary Servants, marching upon an endless plain of sand.

<description>Commonly known as Bluebeard, his real name is Gilles de Rais - a mass serial killer who seems to favour killing children in particular. Caster is a sadistic and evil Servant who derives pleasure from first providing his victims a moment of relief before terrorizing them and then killing them. He expresses an obsessive interest in Saber because he has mistaken her for Jeanne d`Arc, with whom Bluebeard has an infatuation. His sole Noble Phantasm is Prelati`s Spellbook: Text of the Sunken Spiraled City, a magical tome made from human skin which acts as a massive prana source and a guidebook for various spells of varying power, with the strongest spell capable of summoning otherworldly, self-regenerating monsters. The strength of his Noble Phantasm helps make up for his otherwise average ability in magecraft.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Previously known as the Black Knight, Berserker is a Servant who possesses the ability to use practically any object as a Noble Phantasm, allowing him to match Gilgamesh in combat. His madness has reduced him to a mindless, though dangerously skilled, fighter. Despite his insanity, he is still able to instinctively recognize Saber. When Saber finally learns Berserker`s true identity, she is devastated that her decisions in life and her adherence to chivalry had caused her friend such suffering even after dying. He possesses three Noble Phantasms, the first of which is For Someone`s Glory: Not For One`s Own Glory, which envelopes him in a black fog that makes his outline blurred and his status unreadable to other Masters. By use of a Command Spell, it is possible to use the fog to allow Berserker to mimic another`s appearance, although it is noted that had Lancelot been summoned under a different Class, he would be able to freely disguise at will. Knight of Honor: A Knight Does Not Die with Empty Hands, allows him to turn anything he recognizes as a weapon, into a D- ranked Noble Phantasm. If he grabs hold of others` Noble Phantasms, he claims them temporarily as his own and their original rank is retained. His last Noble Phantasm, Arondight: The Unfading Light of the Lake is a magical sword which, when drawn, dispels For Someone`s Glory and Knight of Honour, boosts all his parameters and grants him additional prowess against beings with a `dragon` attribute such as this war`s Saber.

He lives with his father http://anidb.net/ch38668 [Emiya Noritaka] in a rather desolate area of a place called Alimango Island. The actual location of Alimango Island is never mentioned, but, as "alimango" is the Tagalog word for a kind of crab, the island is assumed to be part of the Philippine Archipelago or surrounding areas. At first the locals were distrustful of Kiritsugu and Noritaka, but after a while, although the rarely seen Noritaka continued to be a source of wariness, Kiritsugu started to get along with islanders, specially http://anidb.net/ch44390 [Shirley]. As the locals have difficulty pronouncing his name, they nicknamed him Kerry.</description>

Although he is http://anidb.net/ch37277 [Matou Zouken]`s elder son, he is unfit to be the family heir, because he has very few Magic Circuits, and is considered a failure. Therefore, Kariya was supposed to inherit the position of family head, but he severed ties with the Matou out of disgust.
Some years after Kariya left, Byakuya would eventually meet and marry a woman with the proper traits to give birth to a child more suited to be a magus, but this child, Shinji, was only marginally better. For that reason, he was considered even more of a failure. At the time the events of the http://anidb.net/a8160 [first] and http://anidb.net/a8880 [second] seasons of Fate/Zero take place, he is already a broken, depressed alcoholic. Since Shinji wasn`t good enough to inherit the family either, Zouken adopted Sakura into the family, and placed Byakuya in charge of supervising her worm "training".</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Fujimura Taiga is a friend of http://anidb.net/ch1919 [Emiya Kiritsugu].
During the time after the Fourth Holy Grail War, while Taiga was still a high school student, she develops a crush on Kiritsugu, and frequently visits his house. Due to these visits, the two become friends and she often looks after his adopted son http://anidb.net/ch1904 [Emiya Shirou], who starts to see her as an older sister of sorts. Taiga becomes Shirou`s guardian after Kiritsugu`s death.
This version of her appears briefly in the last episode of http://anidb.net/a8880 [the second season of Fate/Zero], during the construction of the Emiya household. Being a skilled kendo master, Taiga appears with her trademark shinai.</description>
