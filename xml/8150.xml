<description>After the decision to serialise Moritaka and Akito has been made, they are introduced to Miura, their new manager. At first, the two thought it was a joke, but Hattori gives them a pep talk before leaving. While Miura does not seem like a bad person, he is given to rudeness, and the duo worry about their future. In addition, the duo are given 3 assistants to work on their manuscript, and with the assistance of Ozawa, an experienced assistant, their work progresses well.
At the start of the new year, Moritaka and Akito both attend Shounen Jack`s New Year Party. There, they meet Hiramaru Kazuya, said to be a genius of a whole different level from Eiji.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Since college/university students are typically at least eighteen years old, with stories covering mature everyday life topics, you will find the college setting quite often in seinen and josei anime.
Topics that can now be covered - as compared to High School settings - are higher education (i.e. coping with higher intellectual stress), the more adult party life (i.e. alcohol, smoking, sex), the issues of daily life vs. studying - especially when having to work to pay for bills, and finally the possible friction between those in and out of college.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>Asia is Earth`s largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometers, about 30% of Earth`s total land area and 8.7% of the Earth`s total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

<description>The antics of the protagonists do not take place in some exotic setting or time, but in everyday life. When not "at the job" this means getting up in the morning, making meals, house cleaning, going shopping or out to eat, visiting the bath house or spa, leisure activities in the spare time, etc. The time "on the job" for students is School Life, for others working in their profession. Daily Life is basically a synonym for everything normal, repetitive, and trivial happening to your average person.</description>

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<description>Azuki Miho is http://anidb.net/ch16785 [Mashiro]`s former classmate and fiancée. She aspires to become a voice actress and shows promise in the field. She promises to marry Mashiro after they achieve their dreams. However, they must not see each other until then. Since this promise, Azuki has picked up a voicing role, and is gaining growing popularity, not because of her skills, but for her looks. At one point Azuki`s agent urged her to bring out a photo book, in effect becoming a gravure idol. With Mashiro`s support, however, she turned down the offer and persevered in her voice acting. Her mother is the woman Mashiro`s uncle fell in love with. She and Mashiro often communicate through text and sometimes through phone calls, but rarely meet.

<name>Mashiro Nobuhiro</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Mashiro Nobuhiro aka Kawaguchi Tarou (川口たろう) is the late uncle of Moritaka and also a mangaka. He is scruffy looking man, with his hair held in a loose ponytail, and a bit of stubble. He wears round glasses and often holds a cigarette. He is rather uncaring of his appearance, often being seen in a t-shirt and shorts while in his studio. When he was younger, his hair was short and smothed out and he had yet to grow faical hair or wear glasses.
He`s the reason Moritaka know so much about manga. His love interest is Miyuki, Miho`s mother, but was too late to confess with her. At high school, he`s best friend of Miyoshi father, Yosshi. His first manga is a gag manga named Superhero Legend (he wasn`t a good artist; despite getting good grades in art class, his skills were subpar compared to most professional manga artists). Nobuhiro was also especially determined, and refused to let failure dissuade him. Even after learning that Miyuki had gotten married, he continued writing out of the belief that she was still watching him progress, and she did, in fact, she glanced at Shounen Jump to read his manga. After being told that his contract had been canceled, he told Sasaki that he saw it as an opportunity to start over as a newbie, and submitted finished drafts until five days before his death. Nobuhiro believes in three rules for mangakas who are not geniuses; 1) conceit 2) hardwork 3) luck. He was still remembered by the editors long after his passing. Later, Moritaka and Takagi use his workplace as their workplace. He`s a hard-working man, and his death acctually is by overworking because he wanted to get published again, not by suicide. His death is also a matter to dissuade Moritaka to become a mangaka, but later Moritaka can go through it.</description>

<description>Niizuma Eiji is a 16-year-old high school student hailed as a genius by many people. He wins the Tezuka Award for his manga Large bander, after which http://anidb.net/ch16785 [Mashiro Moritaka] and http://anidb.net/ch16787 [Takagi Akito] declare him their rival. Although Mashiro and Takagi view him as a rival, he is very friendly upon meeting them and states he is a fan of theirs. He moves to Tokyo to work on the serialization of his manga Crow on the condition he is able to cancel one series in the Weekly Shounen Jump after becoming the magazine`s most popular author. The head editor has described the difference between Mashiro and Takagi to Niizuma is love of manga, indeed, Niizuma seems to have been obsessed with and drawing manga since he was 6, and makes loud sound effects with his mouth while drawing. Niizuma tends to act conceited because he is hailed as a genius; however, after working on Crow for quite a long time, he is more humble, even claiming to not be good enough of a Mangaka to be judging other people`s work when asked by his editor to judge for the treasure magazine. He works under the direction of the Weekly Shounen Jump editor http://anidb.net/ch19973 [Hattori Yuujirou] and works with two assistants, http://anidb.net/ch19975 [Fukuda Shinta] and http://anidb.net/ch19967 [Nakai Takurou].

Fukuda had already won an honorable mention when he tried for the Tezuka Award and also got seventh place in the same issue of Akamaru Jump in which http://anidb.net/ch20022 [Ashirogi Muto]`s Money and Intelligence ran and got third place. Fukuda then became friends with Mashiro and also competed with Ashirogi in the Golden Future cup with his original manga, Kiyoshi Knight. Fukuda then got serialized somewhat time after Ashirogi and is now an aspiring rival to Ashirogi, Eiji, and http://anidb.net/ch19967 [Nakai]. Among these three, he is considered to have the worst drawings, though they apparently match his stories. His drawings often border on grotesque. He can be extremely conceited and competitive at times, yet helps out his rivals, who are also his friends.

<description>Aoki Kou (real name, Aoki Yuriko (青木 優梨子)) is an aspiring female mangaka that only recently began to work in the shonen genre, previously having worked exclusively as a shoujo manga author. Aoki is a beautiful woman a couple of years older than http://anidb.net/ch16785 [Mashiro] and http://anidb.net/ch16787 [Takagi], which her editor believes will help her sales. She is distrustful of men, as she draws a number of suitors interested in her appearance, including her assistant http://anidb.net/ch19967 [Nakai Takurou], whose advances she rejects a number of times. Because shoujo art styles do not match well with Jump, she initially needs help from assistants and artists in order to be published. She is initially paired with Nakai for her first series, Hideout Door. After Hideout Door is cancelled, Aoki resolves to return to shoujo, although she is later convinced to stay on working for Shonen Jump. She is now working on the serialized series The Time of Green Leaves, which is an ecchi series, although she now does her own drawings with assistance on the ecchi portions from http://anidb.net/ch19975 [Fukuda Shinta].

<description>Hiramaru Kazuya is a new mangaka who, one day, picked up Shounen Jump for the first time in his life, and decided to quit his job to draw manga. His series is called Otters 11 and became serialized around the same time as http://anidb.net/ch16785 [Mashiro] and http://anidb.net/ch16787 [Takagi]. He can be overwhelmed easily and finds it hard to deal with the stress of writing a manga. He frequently shows up at the other mangaka`s studios to hide, but is always soon found out by his editor. He complains about his job a lot and wonders aloud why he ever decided to do it in the first place, but consistently ranks high with the readers in the questionnaires. Due to this, he has been called as a manga genius possibly on the level of http://anidb.net/ch19971 [Niizuma Eiji], especially considering he has barely read any manga.

Although she reject Yosshi because she love Nobuhiro, but later she decided to married someone else because she grew tired of waiting for Nobuhiro said to her "I love You". She looks very young despite her ages; she also bears a strong resemblance to her oldest daughter, Miho, especially when she was younger, looking almost exactly like Miho. At first, she feared Moritaka and Miho would go down the same path at her and Mobuhiro, but has been proven wrong. After learning of Mashiro and Takagi`s plan to be successful mangakas, she encourages them to go through with their dream. Despite being kind and caring, she does have a negative trait of being too nosey about Miho and Moritaka`s love life. Miyuki is good at keeping secrets unless she feels no need to keep them, but she will give hints about the secret, such as warning Miho not to go down the same path in love as she did with Nobuhiro.
