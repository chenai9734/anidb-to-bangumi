<description>A loyal son does not go out to play, but works hard fishing every day to please his father. One day, he finds a pot caught in the net. When he opens the pot, a demon appears from inside. When the demon tries to eat him, the young fisherman, says to the demon "There is no way you could fit in that pot." Indignant, the demon gets in the pot. Now trapped, the demon asks the young man to let it out. He tells it the story of A Lion and a Fox. In the story, a sly fox gets the scraps of the lion`s meal and then cheats the lion out of its house building materials. When the lion gets angry cutting off the fox`s source of food, the fox tells a hunter the location of the lion to have him kill it. The fox, who now has nothing to be afraid of, goes outside only to get eaten by a crocodile. After hearing this story, the demon mends its ways and gives the young man a pot filled with gold coins.
The first animated film commissioned by the Ministry of Education. It was actually produced by Yamamoto Manga Seisakusho established by http://anidb.net/cr7990 [Yamamoto Sanae]. The story is based mainly on "The Fisherman and the Genie" in The Arabian Nights with the fable about the lion and the fox in Machiavelli`s The Prince inserted. In addition to the line-drawn detailed background and characterization, various interesting attempts are made, including using speech balloons with cut-out lettering for conversations.
