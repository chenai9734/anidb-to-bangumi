<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<description>Any anime that is based on a role-playing game aka RPG. A role-playing video game is a video game which includes elements of non-electronic role-playing games. The player assumes control of one or several fictional characters (a party) who have joined forces in order to perform quests and overcome a great number of challenges and enemies, usually monsters inspired by fantasy, and, to a lesser extent, science fiction and classic mythology. During the course of the game the characters, or avatars, which are generally defined by quantized characteristics, evolve and improve in that their various attributes increase, as well as by gaining more powerful artefacts.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>adventure</name>
<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<description>In our terms, a proxy battle is a battle where humans use creatures/robots to do the fighting for them, either by commanding those creatures/robots or by simply evolving them/changing them into battle mode. Often the training aspect is also involved, or in some cases the proxies are nothing more than holographic representatives of some other variation of competition (like for example a card game). While many popular shounen anime fit under this category, it`s not limited to shounen anime.</description>

<name>narration</name>
<description>The most common example is that of a voice, either that of one of the characters or entirely unrelated, that appears at the beginning of an episode to offer a summary or introduction, and at the end of an episode for closure or for a preview to hint upon what to expect next.
Another use of narration comes in the form of a dominant voice belonging to one of the protagonists, intended only for the viewer and revealing the intimate thoughts to whom it belongs. This type of narration occurs frequently throughout the duration of the episode or movie.</description>

<description>No end in sight!
No matter what the genre may be or what the storyline consists of, this series just keeps on going... and on... and on.
The obvious downside to this is the lack of story-related focus, usually some vague goal is simply never reached. This lack of conclusion can tend to annoy, making the whole series pretty much pointless.
Examples: One Piece, Naruto, Bleach, Detective Conan, Dragon Ball (Z), or Pocket Monsters (Pokemon).</description>

<description>A typical plot or sub-plot for many shows. Either the cast or somebody else, that being often the main antagonist, embarks on a quest to collect things, shiny things. Things that are said to grant simple wishes or even do miracles like bringing people back to life, destroying the whole world, galaxy, universe and in rare cases turning the hero into the greatest Pokemon Master. Those things can be weapons, lost technology, magical artefacts, pieces of a giant magical artefact and in some cases even people or little critters.

<name>episodic</name>
<description>An episodic anime consists of many successive short arcs that are generally 1-2 episodes in length, with strong plot continuity within each arc but generally little continuity from one arc to the next. For long shows (well upwards of 50 episodes), the episode count constraint is less tight; for example, a show with close to 250 episodes would also be considered episodic if it consisted of a majority of arcs of up to 3 or maybe 4 episodes and possibly also very few slightly longer arcs.</description>

<description>Bulbasaur is known as the Seed Pokemon. Bulbasaur looks like small, rounder turquoise dicynodon, a mammal-like reptile from the Permian Period. Bulbasaur`s most distinctive feature is the green bulb planted on its back. The plant sprouts and grows with the Pokemon. The bulb synthesizes solar rays. It can later use the energy stored for recovering itself (Synthesis) or release it in the form of a Solarbeam. Because of this Bulbasaur is usually seen napping in bright sunlight. The bulb constantly takes in nourishment from the sun, allowing both the Bulbasaur and the bulb to grow over time. It also allows them to go days without eating by using the nutrients stored in the bulb.</description>

<description>Ivysaur is known as the Seed Pokémon. While almost the same as Bulbasaur the bulb on its back has grown. Having grown much larger, the bulb forces their legs to become stronger and thicker to accommodate the weight, and makes it harder for them to stand on their hind legs. Both the Ivysaur and the bulb grow stronger and larger from sunlight. When the bulb is ready to bloom, they will spend more time lying in sunlight, and the bulb will give off a sweet scent.</description>

In the main Pokémon game series, a Charmeleon is only acquired when a Charmander grows past experience level 16 and is evolved into a Charmeleon. Charmeleon are excessively savage and short-tempered by nature, and they are made to be powerful fighters as a result. The flame on its tail, carried over from its Charmander stage, may burn a bluish white when the Pokémon is excited, and the air temperature often raises to very high levels when the tail flame is waved around.</description>

Squirtle are not acquirable anywhere else in the main series aside from Pokémon Yellow. The name "Squirtle" is a portmanteau of the words "squirt" and "turtle". When feeling threatened, Squirtle withdraw their limbs into their shells and spray water from their mouth with great force, either to attack their opponent or merely to intimidate it.</description>

In the main Pokémon game series, a Blastoise is only acquired when a Wartortle grows past experience level 36 and evolves into a Blastoise. As a Blastoise, two sections of the hefty shell open up to reveal cannon-like spouts on the Pokémon`s back that can fire pressurized water at a target with enough force that even concrete walls and thick steel can be punctured. The spouts are also very accurate, since a Blastoise can strike distant tin cans with the water from its spouts!</description>

<description>Caterpie known as the Worm Pokémon, are larval Pokémon found in the wild early in the Kanto and Johto regions. In main series Pokémon games set in these regions, Caterpie are among the earliest and easiest Pokémon species caught by players, as they are very weak. They can be evolved into their cocoon-like Metapod form and eventually into the butterfly-like Butterfree form. Caterpie in the wild employ biological adaptations to survive, much like real caterpillars, in that their green bodies are useful for camouflage in foliage, their eyes are patterned to scare away predators, their suction-cup feet allow them to climb any surface, and the osmeterium on their heads can project a horrid stench to repel predators. It bears a resemblance to the spicebush swallowtail caterpillar.
In the anime, Caterpie as the first Pokémon Ash ever caught in his trainer career, and it eventually evolved into a Butterfree and was later traded for a Raticate on the S.S. Saint Anne but is traded back later in the episode. Ash releases it later so it could mate with a pink Butterfree.</description>

A Metapod`s exterior is regularly hardened to protect its soft and tender innards while undergoing metamorphosis to eventually become a Butterfree. To conserve energy for this event, the Metapod barely moves.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Butterfree is a dual-type Bug/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Metapod starting at level 10. It is the final form of Caterpie. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Butterfree resembles a vaguely anthropomorphic butterfly with a purple body. Unlike true insects, it only has two body segments and four light blue legs. The upper pair of legs resembles small, three-fingered hands, while the lower pair resembles long, digit-less feet. Butterfree has two black antennae, a light blue snout with two fangs underneath, and large, red compound eyes. Its two pairs of wings are white with black venation. Two oval scales on a female Butterfree`s lower wings are black, but they are white on a male.
As Gigantamax Butterfree, its size increases to gigantic length with altered look. The wings and its pattern changes to light and dark green color with white. The antennae change to bright green and extends to the point where the tip bends, and three red clouds surround it. The eyes changes to bright glowing red. A fur-like circle is attached to both the wings and back of Butterfree. Several green scales can be seen floating around Butterfree, which are its most effective weapons, capable of releasing paralysis, poisoning, or sleep. The massive wings are powerful enough to lift a 10-ton truck through a simple flap. The wind it generates can scatter poisonous scales throughout the area, making it dangerous to be near it.
Butterfree`s wings are covered with poisonous powders that fall off continuously as it flies. It will defend Caterpie from bird Pokémon using this powder. This powder also repels water, enabling it to gather honey even in the rain. Butterfree will roam up to six miles (ten kilometers) from its nest in search of honey, which it carries with the hairs of its legs. Sometimes it has territorial disputes with Cutiefly over fields of flowers. It also consumes sap from trees pierced by Heracross, as seen in the anime. Butterfree is found in temperate forests and jungles, but it has also been observed flying near the ocean as part of its migratory breeding pattern.
Gigantamax Butterfree is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Befuddle.</description>

In main series Pokémon games set in these regions, Weedle are among the earliest and easiest Pokémon species caught by players, and they are very weak Pokémon that are captured to be evolved into their cocoon-like Kakuna form and eventually into the hornet-like Beedrill form. Commonly spotted in the forests and grasslands, eating leaves, Weedle are well protected from predators by sharp two-inch barbs on their heads which secrete a strong poison, and another stinger is on each Weedle`s rear. Sniffing with its big red proboscis, a Weedle uses its extremely acute sense of smell to find the types of leaves it eats.</description>

They can evolve into the hornet-like Beedrill when raised past experience level 10. Within the shell, a Kakuna busily prepares itself for evolution into its adult form, and the amount of energy released by this process makes the shell quite hot to the touch. In the wild, Kakuna are often found near or on trees, and because their range of motion is extremely limited, they may be mistaken for dead. Carelessly approaching a Kakuna in this state would be extremely unwise because it can still extend the barb of its poisonous stinger to protect itself from threats.</description>

Beedrill are extremely territorial, and will be set off by anything that approaches a Beedrill nest. When angered, Beedrill attack in a furious swarm, and the sharp ends of their stingers and the poison stored in their abdomens will definitely be put to use.</description>

<description>Pidgey, known as the Tiny Bird Pokémon, is a bird-like Pokémon, whose original name in the English beta version of Pokémon Red and Blue was "Pidge". Pidgey was first introduced in the United States in Red and Blue. They are one of the first wild Pokémon that players encounter in those games. Pidgey does not like to fight, and will use its wings to stir up clouds of sand in an attempt to distract its would-be opponent and escape. Pidgey also uses this technique to bring its preferred prey of small insects into the open. Pidgey seems to possess magnetoception, as it is capable of returning to its nest from any location without fail.
Pidgey also appeared in the first television episode, Pokémon, I Choose You!, when the main character, Ash Ketchum, attempts to catch one. He fails when it uses its Gust attack to blow him away and escapes. Afterwards, it uses its Sand Attack to blind Ash, allowing it to get away.</description>

In the main Pokémon game series, a Pidgeotto is only acquired when a Pidgey grows past experience level 18 and evolves into a Pidgeotto. A Pidgeotto is extremely territorial, generally claiming a large area with its nest built in the center. Full of vitality, it constantly patrols its territory, mercilessly attacking intruders. They fly about in circular patterns while hunting, and can spot the movements of their prey on the ground no matter how high they fly. The Pidgeotto attacks with its wickedly sharp talons and carries its prey, including Exeggcute and Magikarp, back to its nest from as far as 60 miles away - or more.
Pidgeotto was the second Pokémon Ash caught in the beginning of his career, eventually evolving into Pidgeot.</description>

In the main Pokémon game series, a Pidgeot is only acquired when a Pidgeotto grows past experience level 36 and is evolved into a Pidgeot. Pidgeot are large, powerful birds admired for their glossy plumage and their battling ability. With their powerful chest muscles at work, Pidgeot can flap their wings fast enough to whip up gusts of winds to rival tornadoes. Pidgeot are very aerodynamic, capable of soaring to an altitude of 3300 feet and reaching speeds of up to Mach 2. Like Pidgeotto, Pidgeot feed on Magikarp by swooping from the sky and snatching them out of the water with their talons. Pidgeot appear very similar to Pidgeotto, so much so that one has been easily mistaken for the other, even by official sources.
In the Pokémon anime, Ash`s Pidgeotto evolves into a Pidgeot near the end of the Kanto saga, and remained in Pallet Town to watch over a flock of Pidgey and Pidgeotto while Ash went off to the Orange Islands.</description>

They make their nests almost anywhere and as extreme omnivores eat anything they can scavenge. A Rattata`s fangs grow continuously throughout its lifespan, so it whittles them down to a comfortable size by gnawing on hard objects.</description>

It eats insects in grassy areas by flushing them out with its wings, and plucking at them with its beak. Its wings aren`t good for long distance travel or high flying, but it is able to fly at high speeds by flapping its wings very rapidly. It is very territorial, constantly buzzing about and calling with a loud cry that can be heard from half a mile away. It serves to scare away predators and keep in touch with other Spearow, which usually is used to alert them of danger. The golden spearow has golden wings and a golden beak, it also has a lighter color of brown feathers.</description>

Fearow uses its great wings to catch air currents and effortlessly glide over large distances for as long as a day without having to land or rest. It flies high into the sky, and swoops down at its prey. By using a combination of its neck and beak, it has a large reach, allowing it to pluck bugs from the ground or easily pluck prey from soil or water as it swoops down. If it senses danger, it avoids it if possible.</description>

<description>Pikachu is an Electric-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Pichu when leveled up with high friendship and evolves into Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone. However, the starter Pikachu in Pokémon Yellow will refuse to evolve into Raichu unless it is traded and evolved on another save file.
In Alola, Pikachu will evolve into Alolan Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone.
It also has a Gigantamax form.
Pikachu is popularly known as the mascot of the Pokémon franchise and a major representative of Nintendo`s collective mascots.
It is also the game mascot and starter Pokémon of Pokémon Yellow and Pokémon: Let`s Go, Pikachu!. It has made numerous appearances on the boxes of spin-off titles.
Pikachu is also the starter Pokémon in Pokémon Rumble Blast and Pokémon Rumble World.
Pikachu is a short, chubby rodent Pokémon. It is covered in yellow fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back. It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch for electricity storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is a patch of brown fur. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs.
The anime has shown that wild Pikachu live in groups in forested areas. Pikachu communicate amongst themselves using squeaks and tail-shaking as friendly gestures. In the anime, Alolan Pikachu are known to greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Electricity can be used to receive and send messages with each other, as well as other Electric Pokémon species. It raises its tail to check its surroundings and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups grow, they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. Pikachu forages for Berries, which it roasts with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that Pikachu inhabits a location is patches of burnt grass. It has been observed eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment.
Pikachu charges itself while sleeping overnight, though stress and a lack of sleep can affect this. It is able to release electric discharges of varying intensity. Pikachu has been known to build up energy in its glands, which it will need to discharge to avoid complications. It is also able to release energy through its tail, which acts as a grounding rod, as well as recharging fellow Pikachu with electric shocks. Pikachu can also electrify itself to use its signature move Volt Tackle.
Pikachu has three alternate forms: one, the Cosplay Pikachu appeared exclusively in Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. It is always female, has a black heart-shaped spot at the end of its tail, and can be dressed in any of five outfits corresponding to the five Contest conditions. The second form is Pikachu in a cap, which debuted as an event-exclusive Pokémon in Generation VII. It is always male and has seven variants, each wearing one of Ash`s hats from the anime. In addition to these two forms, many other Pikachu variants have appeared in various media. The last, Partner Pikachu is the Pokémon the player starts with in Pokémon: Let`s Go, Pikachu!. This Pikachu can be either gender, has higher base stats, and has access to moves that normal Pikachu do not.
As Gigantamax Pikachu, it becomes larger and chubbier. Its tail becomes longer and stores all of the electricity it generates, causing it to glow a bright yellow and enabling it to become as powerful as a lightning strike. Its power is equal to that a power plant; however, it is difficult to use it in peoples` homes since Pikachu can only remain in its Gigantamax form for a short time.
Pikachu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Catastropika, while Pikachu in a cap has its own exclusive Z-Move, 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt. Partner Pikachu is the only Pokémon capable of using Zippy Zap, Floaty Fall, Splishy Splash, and the Partner Power, Pika Papow. Pikachu is the only Pokémon capable of using the Light Ball item. Gigantamax Pikachu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Volt Crash.</description>

<description>Raichu is a taller, potbellied form that Pikachu takes when he is given a thunder stone, causing its tail to grow long and black with a lightning bolt on the end and fur to turn orange. It also has a white underbelly, brown stripes on its back, and yellow cheeks, in contrast to Pikachu`s red cheeks and Pichu`s pink cheeks. In the main Pokemon game series, a Raichu is only acquired when an item called a Thunderstone is applied to a Pikachu so that it evolves into a Raichu. Raichu can only learn moves in the Pikachu stage, so the only way to make Raichu learn more moves is by using a TM. Raichu can generate 10,000 or even 100,000 volts of electricity, enough to knock out Pokemon several times its size, such as a Dragonite, as stated in the anime. Raichu`s name is a portmanteau of the kanji 雷 rai, meaning thunder, or lightning bolt, and chuu, which is the Japanese onomatopoeia for a mouse`s squeak.</description>

<description>Sandshrew are a species of brick-skinned mouse-like Pokémon found in several regions throughout the Pokémon world. Despite its name, Sandshrew`s appearance borrows more from the armadillo or the pangolin than from the shrew; its primary means of defense when threatened is to instantly curl up its body into a ball, leaving only its tough skin exposed. When it is rolled up like this, Sandshrew has the potential to withstand many attacks, as well as being dropped from a great height (also similar to hedgehogs). Sandshrew`s natural environment is deep underground in arid, sandy locations with very little moisture, such as a desert. It chooses this habitat to keep its hide as dry and tough as possible, while the sand also provides it with good camouflage.
In keeping with its physical characteristics, Sandshrew has high Defense in the video games, but low Speed. From Ruby and Sapphire onwards, it has the ability Sand Veil, which increases its evasion during a sandstorm. Sandshrew also appears in the spin-off game Pokémon Snap.
A Sandshrew owned by A.J. is featured in the eighth anime episode, "The Path to the Pokémon League." It had many notable traits, such as the ability to withstand water and its knowledge of Fissure, which it used to dispatch Team Rocket.</description>

Generally they are a moderately large, bipedal hedgehog or pangolin-like creature with hard yellow skin, lengthy claws, and a back loaded with an assemblage of large brown spikes. These spikes are hardened sections of Sandslash`s hide that grow to form a natural self-defense when Sandslash curls into a ball. Each spike remains on Sandslash for one year, after which it falls off and a new spike grows in its place. Sandslash can be found in desert areas, particularly close to dry forests. Sandslash`s spikes serve a number of purposes to help cope with its environment, such as providing shade to protect it from the sun and heatstroke or using them offensively to harm both predators and prey. It uses its claws to climb trees, cut up food and dig, the latter being an activity that can cause them to break if done too quickly. It cannot run very quickly, but it is very quick with its claws.</description>

<description>Nidoran are a species of poisonous rabbit-like Pokémon found in the Kanto, Johto, and Sinnoh regions of the Pokémon world. Male Nidoran are classified as a separate species of Pokémon from the females due to differences in appearance between genders, such as the female being light blue and having smaller horns than the male. It should be noted that these were the first Pokémon to have known genders until the release of Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Silver, although they remain as separate species to this date. This Pokémon protects itself with its venomous barbs.</description>

Nidoqueen seem to be omnivores feeding on shrubs and fruit but they may snack on certain small Pokémon for protein. Also, Nidoqueen are much less aggressive than Nidoking and get along much better with others of their kind. Nidoqueen appears to be slightly weaker, but significantly more intelligent than Nidoking.</description>

<description>Nidoran are a species of poisonous rabbit-like Pokémon found in the Kanto, Johto, and Sinnoh regions of the Pokémon world. Unlike most Pokémon, Female Nidoran are classified as a separate species from the males due to extreme differences in appearance between genders, such as the male having larger horns and completely different colors than the female. Male Nidoran are purple, and their horns secrete a powerful venom. The size of the horns determines the potency of the venom. Nidoran stiffens its large ears to sense danger.</description>

<description>Nidoking are a fully grown and developed species of male possum-like Pokémon and the final stage in the male Nidoran evolutionary line. Its horn is hard enough to pierce a diamond and contains secreted venom, making it a powerful stabbing tool upon prey and Pokémon battle opponents. Nidoking have immense upper-body strength, being able to snap a telephone pole like it were a twig. It uses its tail to smash down its target, then constrict it to break its bones. Its thick tail packs enormously destructive power capable of toppling a metal transmission tower.
As several Pokémon seem to have been designed to resemble other aspects of Japanese pop culture and mythology, it is interesting to note that Nidoking bears a resemblance to Baragon, a monster that has appeared in the Godzilla movie series.
In the main Pokémon game series, a Nidoking can only be acquired when a Moon Stone item is applied to a Nidorino so that the creature is evolved into a Nidoking. They are the masculine equivalent to Nidoqueen. Also, they are more primal, fighting other Nidoking for such matters as territory or food. (Or a Nidoqueen, in mating season.)</description>

<description>Clefairy are small, bipedal Pokémon. Popular as pets for their adorable features, Clefairy have short, pink fur, with a large brown patch on each of their two pointed ears. Between these ears is a large swirl of pink fur. They have two small eyes, no nose, and a small mouth with one tiny, protruding fang. They also have a patch of darker pink fur under each eye, which seems to resemble blushing cheeks.
Clefairy can be seen playing in groups, on the night of a full moon, retreating to their group slumber when dawn arrives. These Pokémon are noted to be able to store moonlight in the wings on their backs, giving them the power to float in mid-air. There have been sightings of Clefairy, with their evolutionary forms Cleffa and Clefable, using spaceships, and the Moon Stones used to evolve Clefairy are also rumored to come from extraplanetary locations. Clefairy seem to be based on fairies, as they are magical, winged creatures, lending credit to their name. Also, their game call seems to make a sound similar to their Japanese name.
Clefairy`s biology is somewhat unclear. While they cannot truly fly with their wings, they do travel in a bouncy skipping walk, as if walking on the surface of the moon. When they wave their finger, it stimulates the blood and triggers their brain to perform random attacks from any other Pokèmon, which is the basis of their signature Metronome attack.</description>

<description>Vulpix is a fox-like creature with six curled tails, based on the Japanese fox spirit kitsune. Most commonly female, Vulpix are especially known for being beautiful. As Vulpix undergo Pokemon evolution, their red fur turns pale yellow and they grow three extra tails. Vulpix usually have a friendly, if not spoiled, temperament. Because of the flame in their bodies, when the temperature outside increases, they let flames out of their mouths to prevent their body temperature from getting too hot. In the wild, Vulpix will feign injury to escape from more powerful predators.
During the first season of the Pokemon anime, Vulpix appears often as one of Brock`s Pokemon. It was given to him by a girl named Susie who felt she could not take care of it well. Brock, who felt he was only "babysitting", gives it back to Susie in the season four episode called "Beauty and the Breeder".
Its Japanese name, Rokon is a portmanteau of six (六, roku) and kon (from kon kon, an onomatopoeic word describing the bark of a fox), or an alternate reading of the Japanese word for kitsune (狐, kitsune), meaning fox - in this case, the reading is ko (こ). Its English name may have been derived from the scientific name for a group of foxes, Vulpes.</description>

Ninetales is highly intelligent and able to understand human speech, but also vengeful; Ninetales have been recorded as putting a 1,000 year curse on anyone who grabs one of their tails, which is a focus of the plot in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team. They, along with Vulpix, have keen senses of smell, hearing, and sight. It can only be obtained by using a Fire Stone on a Vulpix. Its Japanese name Kyuukon comes from a combination of the Japanese number 9, kyu, and the sound of a barking fox.
In the anime, Ash and the gang find an abandoned mansion and Brock is deceived by a Ninetales, whose master strongly resembles Brock.
Since it has nine tails, the Pokemon`s name is very commonly misspelled as "Ninetails." Even the Game Boy Color port of the Pokemon Trading Card game uses this misspelling.</description>

<description>Jigglypuff, known as the "Balloon" species of Pokémon, are characterized by putting their enemies to sleep by singing a lullaby. Before beginning to sing, they mesmerize the opponent with their soft, glowing eyes, and if they inflate themselves, they can sing for longer periods of time. They can easily adjust the wavelength of their voices to that of the brain waves of a sleeping being, allowing for their pleasing melody to put its audience to sleep. They sing without pausing to take a breath, so if the opponent is resistant to sleeping, they potentially run out of air.
In the Pokémon anime series, Jigglypuff is a recurring character who aspires to be a great singer after the inspiration of Ash Ketchum and company. Unfortunately for it, every potential audience falls asleep before the song finishes. Jigglypuff does not usually choose an appropriate time to sing and has been a hazard many times, causing Ash Ketchum and his companions to often find themselves running away from Jigglypuff. It keeps with it a black marker, its "microphone," and uses it to scribble on anyone who falls asleep while it`s performing.
Its desire to have someone listen to the entire song was finally satisfied when it encountered a Whismur, who was able to stay awake due to its Soundproof ability.
Also, Jigglypuff`s Japanese name, Purin, translates into "pudding".</description>

<description>Wigglytuff is a relatively large pink balloon-like Pokemon with a white underbelly, large blue baby-like eyes, a pair of large rabbit ears, and a twisty tuft of pink hair on its forehead. It evolves from Jigglypuff through a Moon Stone. In fact, it`s remarkably similar to its pre-evolved form, Jigglypuff, except the ears have grown larger and it now maintains an "oval" shape. Wigglytuff`s eyes are always covered by a thin layer of tears, so that if any dust gets into Wigglytuff`s eyes, it is quickly cried away. In the games, Wigglytuff`s fur is described to be "sublime", so much so that if two of them come into close contact with each other, they are difficult to separate. In the television series, Wigglytuff is generally accepted as the most powerful Pokemon.</description>

<description>Zubat are a basic bat Pokémon species found commonly in the wild in most caves in all the regions of the Pokémon world. In caves and other dark places it navigates using ultrasonic waves. It appears that Zubat is weakened by sunlight, so it hides in caves or other dark places. At night, it will come out and hunt for fruit or Venomoth, or it sucks blood. The female`s fangs are smaller than the male`s.
In the anime, Brock catches a Zubat before entering Mt. Moon. Since then it has evolved to Golbat and then into Crobat. Crobat was given to Forest, with Onix and Geodude by Brock, becoming a Gym Leader.</description>

<description>Golbat are a larger, stronger, and more developed form that Zubat take on when they gain enough experience. In the main Pokemon game series, a Golbat is acquired when a Zubat grows past experience level 22 and is evolved into a Golbat. Golbat are found in some cave areas.
Golbat is a fierce, nocturnal Pokémon, residing in the darkness of caves, and is most active in the pitch black of night, especially if the moon is in its new phase. It is widely known and despised for its feeding behavior: Sucking fresh blood from living things in large quantities. Once it has found a living target, it attacks in a stealthy manner, often striking without warning from behind, to harshly bite down on its prey with its four sharp fangs strong enough to puncture the hide of any animal-like Pokemon, however strong the hide might be. It then proceeds to drink ten ounces of blood instantly. Golbat enjoys blood so much that it does not want to stop, even though a lot of blood will weigh it down enough so that, if it is able to even fly afterwards, it flies clumsily.
Surprisingly, after each attack and feeding sequence, Golbat`s own blood type changes into that of its victim. Once it strikes, it will not stop draining energy from the victim even if it gets too heavy to fly. Like Zubat, the female`s fangs are smaller than the male`s.</description>

<description>Oddish are a weed-like Pokémon found in all regions throughout the Pokémon world. (with the exception of Pokémon Blue and Pokémon Leaf Green) Oddish looks like a small animated onion/turnip plant with a rounded body. Its body is blue or purple with two small feet and red eyes. On top of its head grows a large clump of 5 long green blades of grass. Its name likely came from the words "odd" and "radish".
Oddish is a nocturnal Pokémon, using moonlight rather than the sun`s rays for photosynthesis. During the day, Oddish avoids the sun`s heat and brightness by burying itself into the earth, leaving only the leaves on top of its head visible above ground. In this way it disguises itself as a plant, misdirecting its carnivorous diurnal predators.
While buried, Oddish nourishes itself by absorbing nutrients from the soil using its feet, which are said to temporarily change into a root-like structure for this purpose.
Oddish has been known to use its leaves as hands, such as one who used this to climb a rope net and tried to fly like a Hoppip.
If anyone pulls at Oddish`s leaves and tries to uproot it while it is buried underground, Oddish will react by shrieking in a cute, high-pitched voice. This mirrors the behavior of the legendary mandrake in a similar situation, although it seems that Oddish`s squeaks do not have the same dire consequences as a mandrake`s.</description>

<description>Gloom is a flower-like Pokémon that is a larger and stronger evolution of Oddish. Gloom are obtained when an Oddish gains enough experience to grow up to level 21. Gloom can also be found in most grassy areas of most regions.
The fluid that oozes from its mouth is a sweet nectar that is used to attract prey. Once the prey is attracted, the nectar will cling to the prey, trapping it. The nectar mostly attracts prey that lack a sense of smell, as the nectar smells horrible.
As well as its nectar, the pistil of Gloom`s flower smells incredibly foul; it can be smelled from over a mile away. It has been found that approximately 1 in 1,000 people enjoy the scent that Gloom emits. Those that don`t enjoy the smell have been known to faint upon smelling it. When Gloom is faced with danger, the stench worsens. If it is feeling calm or secure, it does not release the horrible aroma. Oddly enough, people have been known to sniff Gloom, just to get a reaction. This is similar to real world drug addiction.
It is said to widely shower its attacks; with moves such as Stun Spore, Poison Powder, and Sleep Powder, it has the ability to cause status problems on its foes. It is also notable that Gloom has two evolved forms (from the second generation onwards), Vileplume and Bellossom. Unlike other Pokémon that evolve via level, Gloom will not evolve until it is exposed to an evolution stone; a Leaf Stone will make a Vileplume, while a Sun Stone produces a Bellossom.</description>

<description>Vileplume is a huge flower-like Pokémon that is a larger and stronger evolution of Gloom. Vileplumes can be obtained by using a Leaf Stone with a Gloom.
Vileplume is known for its extremely offensive stench that comes from its large red flower. Vileplume uses this stench in battle, catching its foes off guard when they start to back away from the horrible smell. However, Vileplume`s flower can actually be a hindrance in battle due to it being very heavy and bulky. Due to of its weight, Vileplume walks very slowly, and it often must use its hands to help support the flower. Vileplume can be found in forests and they like to stay low to the ground. When they sleep, their huge petals droop over their head and they blend in more with the plants around them. They also release toxic, dense pollen into the air in this position so animals don`t go near them. At night, they sometimes gather together to perform odd rituals - during this time they release toxic pollen to deter intruders. The white markings on this flower are larger in the female than in the male. Paul uses Vileplume to battle Tyrogue, but his Vileplume is useless for Fighting-type Pokemon.</description>

Paras is born with tiny spores covering their body, which grow as the Pokémon feeds, called tochukaso mushrooms. It is noted in that the relationship between the host and the mushrooms is a symbiotic relationship: the mushrooms will sap energy from the host, causing the Paras to continuously burrow underground in forest areas to gnaw on tree roots, since the tochukaso draws most of the energy from the roots. In return, the mushrooms defend the host by spraying toxic spores at enemies. The mushrooms themselves have strong healing properties, and are valued for their life extending properties.</description>

These scales are color-coded to indicate the effect they will have upon coming into contact with a living creature, darker colours meaning poison, and lighter colours meaning paralysis. Venomoth is similar to Butterfree in that they both flap their wings to release toxic powders. However, Venomoth seems to be the more dangerous of the two, as it is described as scattering its toxins with every flap of its wings.

<description>Poliwhirl is a large, amphibious, froglet-like Pokémon. Its hands make it seem as though it is wearing white boxing gloves. It is capable of living in or out of water; in order to live out of water, it must sweat to keep its body slimy. prefers to live underwater in ponds where there is less danger.
In battle, it subtly undulates the spiral-shape on its belly to put the foe to sleep, using a type of hypnosis. It is also capable of easily escaping the grasp of foes due to its greasy skin. Poliwhirl`s spiral goes in the opposite direction of Poliwag`s. Poliwhirl`s mouth is no longer visible after evolution, but it is concluded that it moved to the center of its spiral, since it now sprays water from there.
In the Pokémon anime, Misty had a Poliwhirl in the Johto series, which later evolved into Politoed. Red owns one in the Pokémon adventures which eventually it evolves into a Poliwrath.</description>

<description>Abra (Hocus in English-language beta versions of Pokémon Red and Blue) is a vaguely fox-like psychic Pokémon, which is always depicted to be sleeping in a sitting position. The brown upper torso seems to be armored and it appears to wear two pauldrons.
Abra are described as sleeping eighteen hours a day to conserve their psychic abilities. They also constantly use teleportation while asleep; changing their location once an hour, teleporting away when they sense danger or are attacked, and creating illusory copies of themselves. This constant use of teleportation is Abra`s defining characteristic in the video games.
In the Pokémon anime, Abra appears several times, first in Episode 21, Abra and the Psychic showdown, where it is used by the Saffron City gym leader and evolves into Kadabra. Abra has also appeared in the episode Psychic Vs. Ghost! Midnight Showdown, where he appears to have a main role in the episode.</description>

<description>Alakazam loses the thick tail it once possessed as Kadabra (which might explain why it is 19 pounds lighter than Kadabra). It stands on two legs and always holds two silver spoons. Parts of Alakazam`s body are brown, but its predominant coloring is gold. Alakazam has a long, gold moustache - nonetheless, some Alakazam are female, though in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, females have dramatically smaller moustaches, while the males have longer ones.
Alakazam are described as extremely intelligent. With an IQ of 5,000, they can outperform supercomputers and can memorize anything. Alakazam use their superior intelligence to immediately identify their opponents` weaknesses and gain the edge in battles. This intelligence and superb memory are said to come from the fact that Alakazam`s brain cells never stop multiplying - as a result, the overly large head must be supported by its telekinetic powers. In fact, Alakazam use their psychic abilities to watch all "movement", as their muscles are too weak. Also their senses are incredibly strong: just by closing its eyes it can heighten all the other senses dramatically. Alakazam evolves from Kadabra when you trade it to another Pokémon game.
Alakazam is notable for having the highest Special Attack among non-legendary Pokémon, a statistic that affects the power of mental, fluid, and energy-based attacks, though it shares this title with another Pokémon, Porygon-Z. To balance its extremely high Special Attack, Alakazam`s other stats are atrocious, save for its high speed and average Special Defence, though this is offset by an awful HP stat. Alakazam made an appearance in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, as the leader of Team ACT.</description>

<description>Machoke evolves from Machop at Level 28. An interesting fact about Machoke is when seen in its "shiny" version, it shares a striking resemblance to that of The Hulk, being green in color.
Machoke`s name is a portmanteau of macho, meaning tough, and choke. The Japanese name Goriky is a pun on the Japanese word for superhuman strength (剛力) or godlike strength. Its name was originally "Kong-Fuu" in beta English versions of Red and Blue, which is a reference to Kung fu. Its signature moves include submission, cross chop and dynamic punch.
Machoke, along with its evolved form Machamp, is nicknamed as one of the bodybuilders of the Pokémon world, due to its humanoid appearance, huge muscles and the fact that it wears black speedos, and the belt round its waist makes it look similar to a wrestler (which is most probably what the pokemon was based on). The belt is known as a "Power Save" belt, which keeps Machoke`s power under control and helps to regulate its motions. The explanations of the belt`s purpose vary, but is quoted that because it is so dangerous, no one has ever attempted to remove it.
Machoke has had relatively few anime appearances, most of which were in the Jouto region, most notably in "Machoke, Machoke Man!", in which Machoke was Chuck`s signature Pokemon, and shared a very close bond with its trainer, who sparred and even used submission on during training. Machoke also appear as employed heavy lifters and construction workers, and can also be seen in the beginning of the games Pokémon Saphire and Ruby where a group of Machoke are seen carrying furniture into the players home, which are replaced by Vigoroth in pokemon Emerald.
Despite being measured at 4`11" in the Pokedex, whenever Machoke appear in the anime, they are always around the same height, or taller than, an adult male.</description>

<description>Machamp is a Fighting-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Machoke when traded. It is the final form of Machop. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Machamp is a large, humanoid Pokémon with four well-muscled arms. It has bluish gray skin, red eyes, and pale yellow lips. On its head, there are three brown ridges right above its eyes. It has two arms on each side of its body: a pair located in the normal position, and another pair directly above that attaches on the top of the shoulders. It has black markings that resemble briefs and wears golden power-save belt that resembles a championship belt. Its legs have considerable muscle tone, and its feet have two toes each.
Machamp punches extremely fast, throwing five hundred punches a second. With only one hand, it can move a mountain. Because of its four arms, it can hit from a multitude of angles and pin all of its foe`s limbs at once. Its arms also allow it to attack and defend simultaneously. The four arms react faster before Marchamp think. However, it has poor dexterity, and cannot handle delicate work without its arms becoming tangled. It is a rash Pokémon that rushes into action without forethought. Being the result of an evolution via trading, Machamp is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in the mountains. In the past, it claimed Low Kick, Vital Throw, and Strength as signature moves.
As Gigantamax Machamp, it has become larger with several changes. Its blueish-gray skin becomes darker. The middle ridge located on head becomes longer compare to the other two. All three ridges are also darker now. The neck extends with black markings. The fours fists are now colored dark orange with yellow lines connecting to two orange spots on each arm. The golden belt extends with several more dots. The P in the middle of the belt is colored white and connected to a single yellow circle with nothing in between. The black markings on its leg extend to the legs but stopping near the ankle.
Due to Gigantamaxing, the arms are filled with power, the punches it makes can hit as hard as bomb blasts. There is a legend where Gigantamax Machamp saved a large ship that was in trouble before bringing it to a port.
Gigantamax Machamp is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Chi Strike.</description>

<description>Bellsprout is a carnivorous, flower-like Pokémon, hunting small insects with blinding agility despite its skinny body. It is said to ensnare its prey in its vines and devour it, and can also spit a highly corrosive fluid that can melt even iron. Bellsprout`s preferred habitat is warm and humid climates, since it can absorb more moisture from the ground by planting its root-like feet. In battle, Bellsprout can take advantage of its flexibility to bend and sway its way out of the range of its opponent`s attacks, no matter how powerful they may be.
In the video games, Bellsprout is commonly found among grassy routes, and is used by many Trainers who favor the Grass-type. In Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, the Sprout Tower in Violet City is dedicated to Bellsprout.
Bellsprout has appeared numerous times in the anime series, most notably in "The Fourth Round Rumble," where Ash battled one during the Indigo League. He eventually defeated it with Muk.</description>

<description>Weepinbell is a bell-like Pokémon that resembles its pre-evolution Bellsprout, but without the vines and leaves. Instead of walking, it hops along or hangs on to tree branches and vines using the large hook on its rear end. Weepinbell immobilizes its enemies by using Poisonpowder and Acid. It will swallow anything that moves and digest it within its stomach, and produces a neutralizing fluid to keep from being affected by its own strong stomach acids. If its prey is larger than it, it will first use sharp leaves to slice it up before eating.
Players can obtain a Weepinbell by catching it in the wild, evolving Bellsprout upon reachng level 21, or Snagging a Shadow Weepinbell in Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness. In Pokémon Ranger, enemy Weepinbell can swallow the protagonist whole, knocking him or her back to the beginning of the area.
Weepinbell has appeared in relatively few episodes in the Pokémon anime. It first appeared in "The School of Hard Knocks," and later when Celadon City Gym Leader Erika battled Ash with one. James` Victreebel was also briefly seen as a Weepinbell.</description>

<description>Tentacool (メノクラゲ, Menokurage?) is an aquatic Pokémon based on the box jellyfish. It drifts aimlessly wherever the ocean currents take it, sometimes ending up in shallow waters where it may be accidentally caught in fishing lines. Tentacool may also end up stuck on beaches when low tide comes; since its body is largely composed of water, it will shrivel up, risking death from dehydration if it stays out of the sea for too long. Tentacool has two main weapons. At the tips of its tentacles are toxic feelers, which it uses to stab anything it touches with stinging acid. Due to its excellent camouflage in the water, Tentacool can often remain undetected by swimmers right up to the moment it stings them. Tentacool`s gelatinous, watery body can also absorb sunlight and refract it within, producing beam energy it shoots from its crystal-like eyes.
Tentacool is available in all Pokémon games to date. It is extremely common, especially while surfing on sea routes, and is in almost every single body of water.
In the anime, Tentacool was featured in the episode "Tentacool and Tentacruel" in which a raging mob of the titular Pokémon attacked the Porta Vista resort. The episode was banned after the attacks on September 11, 2001 due to its scenes depicting Tentacools and Tentacruels destroying buildings at a seaside resort.</description>

<description>"Tentacruel" is probably a portmanteau of "tentacle", the reason for which is obvious, and the adjective "cruel", referring to its personality. The name may have something to do with the deep-sea jellyfish called Tentaculata. Its name was originally going to be Man-O-War, which refers to the Portuguese man o` war. The Japanese name, "Dokukurage," is a portmanteau, of 毒 doku (poison) and 水母 kurage (jellyfish). It resembles its pre-evolution Tentacool to a small degree - the "head" of Tentacool has now been made into a hat-like shape on top of a black orb containing its eyes and two very large hooks which resembles a long nose. Also, unlike Tentacool, it has up to 80 tentacles, most of which are hidden, leaving up to 14 exposed.</description>

<description>Geodude has a rock for a head, no nose, and two long arms that start with a bulging muscle and end with rock hands resembling a human`s. Geodude most frequently are found in fields and on mountains. People step or trip on them from time to time, mistaking them for rocks. Its arms are so strong that it can use them to climb mountains. Rhyperior sometimes accidentally shoot Geodude from their cannon-like arms. Geodudes are one of the few Pokémon to have appeared in every Pokémon game.
In the video games, Geodude is commonly found inside caves and mountains, and sometimes appears when Rock Smash is used. Geodude are also found in the Nintendo 64 game Pokémon Snap, hanging from mountainsides by their arms. In the Super Smash Bros. Melee battlefield "Poké Floats", a Geodude is the last float the fighters ride on before returning to the Squirtle float.
Geodude is a recurring character in the Pokémon anime. It first appeared in the fifth episode, "Showdown in Pewter City," used by Gym Leader Brock to battle Ash. Brock became a travel companion of Ash and owned Geodude for the first five seasons. Navel Island Gym Leader Danny and Rustboro City Gym Leader Roxanne have also used Geodude. In the anime, Geodude is able to levitate above the ground.
Geodude`s name comes from the word "Geode" as in a rock with a sparkly inside, and "Dude," usually used to describe a certain kind of male person.</description>

<description>Graveler resembles a large boulder with four arms and two legs. It lives and feeds on rocky mountains. It will climb the slope of a mountain daily, snacking on small rocks along the way, and roll back down once it has reached the peak. Though it is not very fast when walking, a Graveler rolling down a mountain trail is a very dangerous thing to encounter. Carefree by nature, Graveler ignores most obstacles that may appear in its path, such as grass, trees, boulders or even hikers, since it can roll through or over them more often than not. It is not essentially harmed rolling down the slope, even if the odd jutting piece of its body gets broken off. Machop are known to use Graveler as training weights.</description>

Golem inhabits rocky mountains and volcanoes, often disguising itself as an inanimate boulder. It will annually shed its skin like a reptile, with its new shell often being bigger than the one before. Its body is almost impenetrable, able to withstand dynamite blasts; it can even detonate its own body, launching itself great distances in order to travel from mountain to mountain. When earthquakes occur near where Golem live, they will tumble down mountains, rolling at an incredible speed.
In the video games, the only way to obtain Golem is to evolve a Graveler by trading it to another player.
Golem has made numerous appearances in the Pokémon anime. It first appeared in the episode "The Bridge Bike Gang," in which Chopper, the leader of a bicycle gang, uses one to battle Ash`s Charmander.
Golem`s name comes from the word "golem," which is a humanoid clay or stone statue associated with Jewish mysticism.</description>

<description>Ponyta is a Fire-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves into Rapidash starting at level 40.
In Galar, Ponyta has a Psychic-type regional form. It evolves into Galarian Rapidash starting at level 40.
Ponyta is an equine Pokémon with cream-colored fur. It has brown eyes and triangular ears with reddish interiors. Yellow and reddish-orange flames form its mane and tail. The mane forms a short crest on top of its head and a short strip down its back to its tail. Additional flames are present behind its elbows and knees. The fire appears about an hour after hatching. It has four long legs, each ending in a single, gray hoof. These hooves are said to be harder than diamonds.
Ponyta has extraordinary jumping abilities and is capable of leaping tall buildings in a single bound. However, a newborn Ponyta is a weak runner and is actually barely able to stand. It gradually strengthens its legs and becomes faster by chasing after its parents. In the anime, it is shown that Ponyta can control its flames so that its rider is not burned by them. Ponyta live in grasslands, on plains, or anywhere that it can run freely.
In the Galar region, Ponyta has adapted to forests by being exposed to the life energy from it. It has chalk-white fur; long, purple-and-blue, cloudy fur that is also on top of its dark-purple hooves; purple eyes with light-blue irises; and a purple-and-white horn on top of its forehead. Galarian Ponyta can absorb the life energy located in the atmosphere and store it in its mane, which will then become more colorful and potentially release a shining glow if there is a lot of energy to use. The small horn contains a healing power. Ponyta can heal any slight wounds with a few rubs from its horn. By looking it the eyes of a person, it can read the contents of the heart. Should Ponyta find any evil, it will promptly go back into hiding.</description>

Flames are also present on its fetlocks. It has slender legs, each with a single black hoof.
Rapidash is a very agile Pokémon. It runs at about 150 mph (240 km/h), chasing everything that moves in hopes of racing it. With incredible acceleration, it reaches its top speed in only ten steps. At full gallop, its hooves barely touch the ground. The faster Rapidash goes, the longer the swaying flames of its mane will become. At an all-out gallop, its blazing mane sparkles, a feature which is said to enhance its beautiful appearance. Rapidash lives in grasslands, but it can also be seen on mountains in Pokémon Snap.</description>

It has four legs, each of which ends in a single white claw. Its long, tapering tail has a white tip. This tail drips a sweet, sappy substance that is attractive to many species of fish. Slowpoke uses the tail as a fishing lure. The tail often breaks off, but it will grow back. In Alola, its tail is often dried and used in home cooked stews.
Slowpoke has notoriously dim intellect, and often forgets what it was doing. It takes a long time to respond to outside stimuli. For example, it can take up to five seconds to process pain and can take an entire day to notice when its tail has been bitten. Slowpoke is commonly found at the water`s edge. In some places, it is believed that Slowpoke`s yawn causes rain. This Pokémon is worshiped in those areas.

It floats through the air, through a sort of electromagnetic antigravity field generated by the two magnets on either side of its body. When defending itself in the wild or fighting in a Pokémon battle at the orders of a Pokémon trainer, it can also generate powerful electric shocks. Magnemite consumes electricity, so they`re attracted to power lines and electronic gadgets. Magnemite tend to crowd around generators and power plants, and an individual Magnemite might be attracted to someone with a pocket radio or a Pokégear.
Despite their mechanical appearance, lack of gender, and alien tendencies, Magnemite are living things; they are not built, they feel the need to eat, and they have something similar to a mating urge. A trio of Magnemite may come together to create their evolved form, Magneton.</description>

It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
In Galar, Farfetch`d has a Fighting-type regional form. Galarian Farfetch`d evolves into Sirfetch`d after landing three critical hits in a single battle, regardless of if it faints.
Farfetch`d is an avian Pokémon that resembles a light brown duck with a white underbelly. It has a flat, yellow beak, brown eyes, a V-shaped black marking on its forehead similar to a unibrow, and a three-feather crest on top of its head. Its wings are as big as its body and appear to be prehensile enough to substitute for hands. It has yellow legs with webbed feet and a stubby tail.
Farfetch`d is always seen carrying a leek stalk or spring onion. It carries this sprig in its wings, but sometimes chooses to hold it in its beak or feet instead. Unable to live without its stick, Farfetch`d will defend the stalk with its life. Losing it can leave Farfetch`d defenseless. Known uses for the stick include use as a weapon, nesting material, and emergency food source. It is selective about which sticks it will use and has been known to fight over good ones. Farfetch`d is found in temperate grasslands.
Galarian Farfetch`d is a deeper shade of brown, with a more prominent black mark on its head. As the leeks in Galar are much larger than those elsewhere, it carries its leek over its wing in order to better manage its heavy weight. It is renowned for its courage in battle.
Farfetch`d and its evolution Sirfetch`d are the only Pokémon capable of using the Leek item.</description>

<description>Doduo resembles an ostrich or a roadrunner, with sharper beaks and an extra head. It may also be based on the kiwi. Its name is a portmanteau of the words dodo, the extinct flightless bird, and duo, in reference to its two heads. Doduo`s tracks are huge and very distinctive. It inhabits and races across grass-covered plains at 60 mph. It is well-adapted to dry and arid climates. Doduo`s second head is said to have been formed by a sudden mutation thousands of years ago. Both heads normally contain identical brains, although rare cases have been observed where a Doduo has two distinctly different brains.
Interestingly, Doduo can be caught in the wild in all of the Pokémon video games. Doduo can also be found in Pokémon Snap.
In the Pokémon anime episode "Bad to the Bone," Jessie of Team Rocket battles a Doduo with her Arbok. The battle is interrupted when the Doduo`s heads begin to fight with each other.</description>

<description>Dodrio is a flightless bird Pokémon with long, powerful legs. Dodrio resembles an ostrich, and its movement is reminiscent of the roadrunner. Its name is a portmanteau of the words dodo, the extinct flightless bird, and trio, in reference to its three heads.
As the evolved form of the two-headed Doduo, Dodrio has three heads, the third head which is said to be formed by one of Doduo`s heads splitting during evolution. Each one of the heads constantly expresses a different emotion: joy, sadness, and anger. Having three heads allows Dodrio to collect more information from its surroundings, develop complex plans, and remain alert at all times by keeping watch in three different directions. On the other hand, a Dodrio`s three heads are commonly known to squabble amongst themselves, probably due to each one having a different attitude. Though Dodrio struggles to fly, it has three sets of hearts and lungs to match its heads, granting it extraordinary stamina while running at high speed. Like its pre-evolution Doduo, it inhabits dry, grassy plains.
In the video games, Dodrio are often used by Bird Keepers and Triathletes practicing in running. In Pokémon Ranger, a Dodrio is the partner of the Fall City Ranger Leader Joel. Dodrio also features in the Pokémon Stadium games as Dodrio Mode, which speeds up the games` GameBoy emulator, and in FireRed, LeafGreen, and Emerald in the mini-game Dodrio Berry-Picking.
In the Pokémon anime, Dodrio first appeared on the morning of the first episode, crowing in place of a rooster. Dario used one in the episode "The Flame Pokémon-athon," and Violet City Gym Leader Falkner battled Ash`s Pikachu with one. Gary Oak also evolved his Doduo into a Dodrio.</description>

<description>Seel are well suited to life in the most frigid reaches of the planet. They are nocturnal; in the daytime they are seen asleep on the seabed in shallow water. When hunting, Seel stay in the ocean because they cannot walk on land. Instead, they swim in a rather graceful fashion literally underneath sheets of ice floating on the water`s surface in their environment in search of their prey. Even though the air is a frigid 14 degrees Fahrenheit and the water itself is a somewhat less chilling 40 degrees, their fur hides are thick enough to insulate Seel from either degree of cold and their nostrils automatically close by themselves to ensure their ability to remain underwater. When they need to take in air, they will use their hard horns to punch holes through the ice sheet above and pop their heads out.</description>

<description>Dewgong`s name is derived from the real animal which has a similar, but much larger, body: the dugong. In the beta versions of Red/Blue, Dewgong`s name was originally going to be Manaty, a reference to the manatee. The Pokémon first appears in the arsenal of a trainer named "Allison" outside of Saffron City, who cites her similar body fat percentage as a reason for her choosing to utilize the Water/Ice type Pokémon.</description>

<description>Grimer is composed primarily of putrid, hardened sludge and grime. It smells incredibly foul, and can influence the abandonment of entire cities due to its polluting nature--even weeds don`t grow where a Grimer has appeared. Grimer thrives in filthy areas, such as factories, garbage dumps, sewers and polluted water systems. It survives and matures by sucking up polluted sludge that is pumped out of factories, adding toxic waste to its already toxic girth. It enters sewers and other areas with great ease due to its rubbery and semi-viscous body; for example, it can enter barred-off areas by slipping between the narrow bars. If a person stuck his hand in a Grimer, that person would have a difficult time pulling it out from its body.</description>

<description>Muk is a living manifestation of sludge and waste. Muk thrives in toxic waste and garbage. It inhabits any polluted area; including abandoned factories, garbage dumps and sewers. It is said that its smell is comparable to that of reeking kitchen garbage, especially during hot summers. Muk itself is also a source of pollution. As Muk slides across the ground, it leaves behind a trail of highly poisonous sludge. Muk and Grimer are known for traveling into water and polluting it and killing plants with their sludge. Muk could be considered antagonistic of Suicune, a Pokémon with the ability to purify dirty or polluted water. It can also be considered antagonistic of Celebi, which can bring dead plants back to life.
In the anime, Ash and friends encounter a horde of Grimer, which is led by a Muk. After a group of Magnemits and Magnetons save them, Ash captures the Muk. When Ash first caught Muk, its smell was able to escape the Poké Ball, much to everyone`s displeasure. For this reason, Muk was given to Professor Oak. A running gag in the series involves Muk and his overly affectionate personality. He constantly expressing gratitude towards Professor Oak by hugging him, and in the process smothering him with its gooey body, he also started to do this with Professor Birch.</description>

<description>Shellder is a cheeky bivalve (oyster or clam) Pokémon; it constantly pokes its tongue out at anybody, whether friend or foe. It will also spit on foes. This tends to antagonize enemies into a rage. Its shell is very strong, apparently harder than a diamond, though only made of a single, smooth layer. Shellder becomes vulnerable when the enemy can attack its insides. When not protecting itself in battle, it will attack by squirting water at the foe. As a last resort, it will clamp the foe with its powerful shell. However, this leaves Shellder vulnerable to an attack, hence, it is rarely used. As a total last resort, Shellder may use Selfdestruct or Explosion to knock itself and the enemy out. Shellder travels by rapidly opening and closing its shell, propelling it in the opposite direction of its shell through the water. Shellder are incapable of travel on land, unless in a Poké Ball.
Shellder is integral to the evolution of Slowpoke as is the body part of Slowpoke to which Shellder bites on: its tail. Once Shellder bites the Slowpoke`s tail, the two will evolve into a single Pokémon, Slowbro. If Shellder instead attaches itself to Slowpoke`s head, it will create Slowking, a notably smarter Pokémon than the other two. This evolution can be reversed if Shellder falls off Slowbro`s tail or Slowking`s head. The evolution benefits both Pokémon: Slowpoke can now walk on its hind legs and Shellder can both eat the scraps of the Slowpoke, and finally move on land. The newly attached Shellder looks very different from its previous purple form.</description>

<description>Gastly (Spirit in the Beta versions of the English language versions of Pokémon Red and Blue) is made of a very thin, gas-like substance, which grants it certain powers and weaknesses. Some say it is an other-dimensional lifeform, while others believe it is formed from toxic gas. It can sneak into any place if it so wishes thanks to the invasive properties of gas molecules. It can render itself nearly invisible and approach enemies undetected, and can envelop said enemies regardless of their size and induce sleepiness, slow poisoning through the skin, or even suffocation.
On the other hand, Gastly`s negligible weight and gaseous nature make it very easy for it to be blown off or even scattered to nothingness under a strong wind (although it is presumed the molecules can regroup later). A Gastly will not appear in windy weather if it can help it, but when it finds itself threatened by a strong wind, it clusters in groups under the eaves of houses to protect itself.</description>

<description>Haunter (Spectre in the beta versions of Red/Blue) takes the shape of an angular floating face with disembodied hands. It has a sinister look, complete with fangs and claws. However, when approached by people, it has a habit of reverting to a spherical form that obscures its eyes, mouth, and hands. Haunter is considered in the Pokédex to be a `gas type` Pokémon, because of the overall structure of his body. Because of its ability to slip through block walls, Haunter is said to be from another dimension. They seem to eat by first paralyzing their opponent with Lick, then draining a bit of their life force, although it`s possible they may eat other food as well, such things like Pokéblocks. It is also said to eat people`s dreams by going inside them and scaring them to death. It is the lightest of all discovered pokemon.</description>

<description>Gengar is a dual-type Ghost/Poison Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Haunter when traded. It is the final form of Gastly. It can Mega Evolve into Mega Gengar using the Gengarite. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Gengar is a dark purple, bipedal Pokémon with a roundish body. It has red eyes, a wide mouth that is usually curled into a sinister grin, and pointed ears. On its back are numerous spikes and it has smaller spikes on top of its head similar to tufty fur. Its arms and legs are short with three digits on both its hands and feet. It also has a stubby tail.
Gengar has the ability to hide perfectly in the shadow of any object, granting it exceptional stealth. However, Gengar`s body acts as a heat sink. Its presence cools the temperature of the surrounding area by nearly 10°F (5°C), because it absorbs the warmth. The anime has shown that Gengar can fly and possess people and other Pokémon. In the past, Night Shade was its signature move.
Gengar is very mischievous, and at times, malicious. It enjoys playing practical jokes and casting curses, such as pretending to be one`s shadow, then behaving erratically. When the quarry notices, the Gengar takes delight in its victim`s terror. However, Gengar has been known to be loyal to a Trainer who treats it well. Being the result of an evolution via trading, Gengar is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in caves and dark places where shadows form. It is especially fond of urban areas such as cities and back alleys, but only during the night.
As Mega Gengar, a portion of its body sinks into the ground and its arms and tail lengthen. The lower portions turn a more reddish purple, and a third eye appears on its forehead. This new unblinking eye is oval, yellow, and allows it to see into other dimensions. The spikes on Mega Gengar`s back are more numerous and pointed and additional spikes appear on its hands and tail. Its ears are now considerably longer and tilt backward.
Mega Gengar has the ability to access other dimensions and has a vicious nature. Mega Gengar has no itnerests in opponents unless perceived as prey. Its relationships are warped due to Mega Evolution. It now desires to take the life and curse anyone or anything in its path It may even curse its own Trainer. Mega Gengar sinks into an another dimension to wait for a chance to attack.
As Gigantamax Genger, it becomes larger with portions of its body sinking into ground. Only the head, tail, and arms remain. Also it changes to from a dark purple to lighter purple. The eyes change to the color white with yellow sclera. The inside of the mouth changes to resemble a tunnel with a long purple tounge sticking out. Three red clouds surrounds the top of Gengar’s head.
There’s a rumor where Gigantamax Gengar’s mouth does not lead into its body. Due the cursed energy, it’s believed to instead lead into the afterlife. By laying a trap, it hope to steal the lives of those it captures. Should someone stand near its mouth, they can hear the voices of their loved ones calling out to them.
Gigantamax Gengar is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Terror.</description>

<description>Onix is a subterranean creature that bores its way through the ground at a rate of 50 mph (80 km/h) in search of food. The tunnels it leaves behind as it burrows through the earth are used as pre-dug homes by other subterranean Pokémon such as Diglett and Geodude. Within Onyx`s member is a structure nigh identical to a magnet, which allows it to determine its heading, its depth underground, and other such information useful for a subterranean Pokémon to know. It acts quite like a compass. As Onix ages, it burrows deeper underground, and its rocky member becomes progressively harder, rounder, and smoother. Around the age of 100, the pressures exerted on its stone member become so high that it is compressed into a much harder, diamond-like composition, although it is closer to metal in nature.
In the anime, an Onix is owned by Brock as part of the many Pokemon owned by the training gym that Brock`s family runs. Brock had initially received the Onix from his father, who is a specialist in rock-type Pokemon. When Brock feels the need to travel with Ash Ketchum yet again, he entrusts the care of the Onix to one of his many younger brothers. This takes place in Pokémon Chronicles. It eventually evolves into a Steelix.</description>

<description>Drowzee is a creature with an elephant`s trunk, the body and color pattern of a tapir, and a hunger for dreams, traits that characterize Drowzee. Its name comes from the English word "drowsy", which reflects on the fact that Drowzee`s primary ability is to put foes to sleep. The "-zee" comes from the sleeping phrase "ZzZzZ". Its Japanese name, Sleepe, is a corruption of the English word sleep. Drowzee`s original biology was based on the tapir and its appearance and dream-eating behavior are inspired by the Japanese folkloric creature Baku. However, its nature is much unlike the real-world animal it was based on.
Drowzee eats dreams; in order to eat, it must put its prey to sleep. A nightmare or night terror will give it indigestion, and it prefers the dreams of human children to those of adults or other pokémon. It`s psychic, but it has limited abilities, compared to other Pokémon; it does not display telekinesis, for example. However, its telepathy allows it to detect people who are asleep, even while asleep itself. Its memory when it comes to dreams is eidetic, and it has the ability to show anyone any dream it has eaten. If one thinks he/she had a good dream, but is unable to remember it, it was possibly eaten by a Drowzee.</description>

<description>Krabby is a crab with large pincers. Krabby is an omnivore and a scavenger; it rarely hunts for itself. It can also act as a filter feeder by digesting the bacteria in sand, but this is rare. It is territorial, and in beaches where there is little food, fights between Krabby are common. Krabby also uses camouflage; it can form mucus sacs about itself if threatened, making it seem larger or making it harder to spot against sea sand. It is usually very small, but it makes up by its aggressiveness.
Krabby first appeared at a beach in episode 13, Mystery At The Lighthouse, when Ash Ketchum wanted to prove that he could catch a Pokémon alone. After the capture (which involved Krabby attacking Ash`s finger), it was automatically transferred to Professor Oak`s lab, because Ash already had six Pokémon with him. To Ash`s great surprise, Gary had also caught another Krabby, which was much larger than his. Ash used Krabby in his first battle at the Indigo Tournament. Krabby won against an Exeggutor and evolved into Kingler, despite the fact that Krabby had never battled before.</description>

<description>Kingler is a Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Krabby starting at level 28. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Kingler is a crustacean Pokémon resembling a crab. Its strong shell covers the outside of its body, featuring a red upper half and a light tan lower half. Its upper half is topped with six tall, thin spikes that resemble a crown. Its light tan arms are also connected to its upper body. Its lower half doubles as its jaw with six fangs overlapping its upper body. Its two outer fangs are much larger than the inner four and are roughly half as tall as Kingler`s entire body. Its hips visibly protrude from its lower body and connect to its four long, thin legs. Each leg has a single, claw-like foot. Kingler`s main feature is its red pincers. Its left claw is roughly twice as large as the other and hard as steel.
Kingler is often found on the edges of water, usually the ocean. It its powerful claws have 10,000 horsepower and are capable of prying open the shells of Shellder and Cloyster. While Kingler`s large, left claw is its main tool for offensive maneuvers, it is so large and heavy that Kingler can barely lift it. It causes balancing problems and Kingler may quickly become fatigued from continuous use. However, it has been shown to communicate with other Kingler by waving its pincers around. In the past, Crabhammer was its signature move.
Gigantamax Kingler is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Foam Burst.</description>

<description>Voltorb are aggressive red and white ball shaped Pokémon that looks strikingly similar to a Poké Ball. Coincidently it was discovered shortly after Poké Balls were invented, some believe there is a connection. Though roughly ten times larger, many trainers get a surprise when they pick one up thinking it is a Poké Ball. The strength of their explosions is dependent on how much electricity they store in their bodies. When jarred or angered, a Voltorb can and will explode, causing massive damage to their aggressor and themselves (as seen in the video games when they use the moves `Self-Destruct` or `Explosion`, both of which causes fainting to the user). It is so unstable that even the slightest bump in the road will make it explode spontaneously. Voltorb do not have a mouth, but do have two eyes that are normally slanted into an aggressive or angry stare.</description>

<description>Electrode is a red and white ball shaped Pokémon that looks strikingly similar to a Pokéball with its colors reversed (white on top and red on bottom instead of red on top and white on bottom, like Voltorb). They are known to explode at the slightest shock and without warning. Electrodes feed on and stores electricity from power plants and lightning storms, but rarely do they use it to attack foes. It instead uses its stored electric to increase its rolling speed. The amount of electricity in an Electrode is relative to how powerful its explosions are. The stored energy also generates strong static electricity around Electrode`s body, sometimes paralyzing enemies on contact. If it is bored, it often amuses itself by exploding. Electrode has two beady eyes and an almost nonstop grin.</description>

The heads are considered fruit or nuts and each has a different expression on its face similar to Exeggcute. When an Exeggcute evolves into Exeggutor, any and all cracks and breaks are mended as they turn yellow and combine to form the new Exeggutor. Living in a good environment will allow it to grow lots of heads, and it is said that they occasionally fall off to form new Exeggcute.</description>

The "Cu-" may also be derived from cute, as Cubone is rather referred to as cute and lonely, or the derogatory term "cue ball", referring to a bald person, which is a reference to the skull it wears. Its Japanese name is most likely a pun on 空 kara (emptiness), 殻 kara (shell), and/or からから karakara (dried-up). In the Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow a Cubone is adopted by Mr. Fuji after its mother is killed by Team Rocket. Cubone is also a playable character in Pokémon Red Rescue Team and Pokémon Blue Rescue Team. The skull a Cubone wears on its head is said to be the skull of its mother, who dies whenever a Cubone is born. Because it never removes its skull helmet, no one has ever seen a Cubone`s actual face. Its cries for its mother are often heard echoing inside the skull.</description>

After the production of Pokémon Diamond/Pearl, it is revealed that the male Rhydon has a longer drill horn than the female.
Rhydon`s brain is considerably more developed than that of its pre-evolved form Rhyhorn, which allows it to exhibit some signs of advanced intelligence, including the ability to stand upright and walk on two legs. It is capable of living in molten lava under the ground.
Rhydon is notable for being one of the very few non-water rock type Pokémon to learn the move surf.</description>

At its center is a large gem, surrounded by a golden crest like structure. Starmie`s center section - the gem - is known as its "core". This gem is considered very valuable among collectors. The gem`s hue can change to any color in the visual spectrum, earning Starmie the nickname "the gem of the sea". When Starmie is weak, the core grows dim and starts flickering whilst producing distinctive warning sounds.
In the Pokémon world, the aforementioned peculiar properties of Starmie`s anatomy leads some people to theorize that Starmie`s origins are not of this planet, and that its luminescent core is used to send electromagnetic signals into outer space. It may have some connection with Deoxys having a similar core and the ability to regenerate. In ancient times, Starmie was attributed an equally mystical origin: that it was created from the reflection of the stars upon the waves at night.
In the anime, Starmie is one of the Pokémon used in Misty`s team during the most of the Kanto arc, along with its pre-evolved form, Staryu. Misty also often used Starmie outside of battle for transportation through water or for fire-fighting purposes. Misty eventually left Starmie in the care of her sisters at the Cerulean City Gym, and later reobtained it upon her return.</description>

<description>Mr. Mime is a dual-type Psychic/Fairy Pokémon introduced in Generation I. Prior to Generation VI, it was a pure Psychic-type Pokémon.
It evolves from Mime Jr. when leveled up while knowing Mimic.
In Galar, Mr. Mime has an Ice/Psychic-type regional form. It evolves into Mr. Rime starting at level 42. All Mime Jr. in Galar evolve into this form regardless of their origin.
Mr. Mime is a bipedal, humanoid Pokémon. Blue growths resembling clown hair extend from the sides of its pale pink head, and there is a magenta circle on each cheek. Its jaw is curved inward, resembling the mouth of a wooden dummy. It has a round, white body with a magenta spot in the middle, light pink arms and legs that connect to its body via magenta spheres, and small white coverings over its knees. Its white hands resemble gloves with magenta pads on the tips of its white fingers and its dark blue feet curl upward at the tips.
From birth, this Pokémon is an excellent pantomime. As it matures, it gains the ability to solidify air molecules by vibrating its fingertips. This ability allows it to create invisible objects with its gestures. It punishes those who interrupt its act or are not impressed by slapping them. Mr. Mime is usually very rare, but can be found in suburban areas. In the past, Substitute was its signature move.
Galarian Mr. Mime are mostly blue and white. Much like other Mr. Mime they also have blue growths resembling clown hair, however, these also extend and cover its cheeks. They have wider-shaped eyes then other Mr. Mime and they have a blue nose. Their bodies have a white top and a blue bottom and they have a diamond made of ice that resembles a tie. They have blue shoulder spheres, but lack these spheres on their legs. Unlike other Mr. Mime, Galarian Mr. Mime do not have defined fingers and instead have mitten-like hands. Their feet are more defined, resembling blue shoes with light blue soles, presumably made out of ice. Rather than miming, Galarian Mr. Mime`s main talent is tap dancing. Their feet radiate chilliness and can be used to create a floor of ice, which they can kick up to act as a barrier.</description>

<description>Scyther is a mantis Pokémon. Its English name was originally going to be Stryke, as revealed in the 1999 Nintendo Official Magazine Pokémon Special #2. Scyther`s most impressive feature is its scythe-like arms that can easily cut through metal. Scyther is also noted for its agility. While hunting in the wild or in a battle between trainers, it relies on its speed to strike quickly and to avoid being struck in return by its foe. Its high-supernatural speed can make it seem to be in more than one place at once, or to seem invisible as it moves in, strikes, and leaves the opponent before he can feel the blow. Scyther`s wings are capable of flight, but this is rare; it is not a fast or an agile flier, and it is a better hunter on its own feet.
In the anime, Tracey Sketchit catches a Scyther in the Orange Islands. It is aged and was recently removed from its clan by a younger, stronger Scyther. The bug Pokémon reconcile their differences through the interference of Team Rocket, and Tracey`s Scyther is allowed to leave with him with its conflicts fully resolved. Tracey`s Scyther is incredibly strong-willed, preferring to keep watch over the travellers while they sleep, as opposed to staying in its Poké Ball.
In the episode "Showdown at Dark City", two gangs were fighting in a dusty town. The leader of one team had an Electabuzz while the other had a Scyther. When Ash poured ketchup barrels on both Pokémon, they locked into each other in a death grip, meaning that Scyther and Electabuzz are possibly provoked by the color red.</description>

<description>Since Electabuzz is electric, he feeds on electrical currents. Its methods of securing its food vary: during thunderstorms, an Electabuzz climbs to the highest place possible, in hopes that it will be struck by lightning. As a result, many towns in the Pokémon world employ an Electabuzz in lieu of a lightning rod. Electabuzz also lurk around power plants, feeding off the electricity generated there. This behavior is dangerous to the public, as occasionally blackouts are caused by an Electabuzz overindulging itself at a power plant, or worse, walking down to a city and drawing electricity from there.
Due to its unique diet, Electabuzz`s body is constantly discharging stored electricity, to the point that it glows whitish blue in darkness and static electricity effects manifest. An Electabuzz can control the electric current coursing in its body to communicate with other Electric-type Pokémon, especially with another Electabuzz. It originally is lone in its evolutionary line, but it gains a previous form, Elekid, in Pokémon Gold and Silver, and an evolution, Electivire, in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.
Like Scyther, as seen in the anime, Electabuzz is most likely provoked by the color red.</description>

<description>Magmar is born in the proximity of an active volcano, and if possible it spends its entire life there, or at least in a place hot enough to sustain its body temperature of 3,300 degrees Fahrenheit. If a Magmar finds itself in a cold place, it will try to make it more habitable by blowing scorching flames around. It has the ability to expel orange-colored fire from every part of its body, including its mouth. This serves both offensive and defensive purposes: a Magmar cloaked in flames resembles a big ball of fire. Together with its matching body coloration, Magmar can quite easily hide itself among flames, escaping detection. If Magmar is actually wounded, it can heal itself by dipping its wound(s) in lava. When it emerges, damp soil clings onto its body. In Gold and Silver, Magmar gets a pre-evolution, Magby, and in Diamond and Pearl, an evolution, Magmortar.
Magmar has appeared in the anime owned by various people but the ones of note are the Gym Leader Blaine, Ash`s now ex-rival, Gary Oak, and his new rival, Paul. Paul had been looking for a new fire Pokémon since the release of Chimchar in "Glory Blaze" and captured Magmar sometime between capturing Gliscor in ""Gliscor and Gligar: Getting Through the Wind Maze" and his Gym Battle, with Maylene which was shown as a flashback in "Lucario and the Aura Sphere of Rage."</description>

<description>Pinsir is a bug-type stag beetle Pokémon covered with a thick exoskeleton. Its large pincers are adorned with sharp spikes which serve to damage foes caught in the pincers and to prevent escape. If it fails to crush its foe, it will throw the foe powerfully against the ground or into another object with its pincers. Pinsir requires warm habitats to survive. It becomes immobilized in cold climates. It burrows itself into dirt using its pincers and sleeps in the burrow through the night.</description>

<description>Tauros is a bull known for its violent urges and rowdy, aggressive disposition in general, as supplied by a tremendous amount of natural stamina. Any given Tauros finds it impossible to keep up its spirits in life without near-constant rampaging. It always tries to find opponent Pokémon to battle outright to serve this purpose, but if it is alone, it will instead concentrate on charging at and knocking down thick trees to calm itself. By locking horns with other Tauros, it fights to assert dominance in a herd. The protector of the herd is usually noted by battle torn horns. As Tauros is based on a bull, it is a male-only Pokémon; its female equivalent is the more cowlike Miltank.
Tauros has a special habit that specifically affects its ability to battle, both in the wild and in trainer-directed Pokémon battles: It whips itself with its three long snapping tails. When it targets an enemy, it heightens its will to battle by whipping its own backside with its tails before charging at full speed.
In the anime, Ash Ketchum captures a herd of thirty Tauros in the Safari Zone (though the episode which features this was banned in America due to its flagrant gun use and politically incorrect humor). They usually remain in Professor Oak`s fields, Ash occasionally picks one up for various tournaments or important battles.</description>

<description>Magikarp is a commonly found Pokémon that can survive in rivers, lakes,and oceans. Despite its adaptability, the Pokédex states that the Magikarp species has grown weaker over time, and it is one of the least viable for battling in the series. It eventually evolves into another, far more powerful Pokémon, Gyarados.
Magikarp is commonly thought of as the weakest Pokémon. They are only able to learn three moves: Splash (does absolutely nothing), Tackle (a weak attack), and Flail (which does more damage as Magikarp is more damaged.)
In the anime, Magikarp has appeared several times, most notably as the subject of a running gag in which a salesman attempts to trick Team Rocket into buying Magikarp in various guises. (This man also appears in Pokémon Red, Blue, Yellow, FireRed, and LeafGreen.) Team Rocket later adopted a Magikarp-shaped submarine.
Magikarp also appear many times in the video games. They can be found in almost any pond, river, lake, or sea. Many trainers have them, along with other weak Water Pokémon like Goldeen or Horsea. In Pokémon Pearl, one trainer named "Ander," found outside Lake Valor, possesses a Magikarp whose move "Quake" replaces the normal Magikarp`s equally useless "Splash".</description>

<gender>dimorphic</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Gyarados is the evolved form of Magikarp. It is a dramatically large change from Magikarp, going from a small fish to a long draconic, serpentine body. Gyarados tend to be very aggressive, and are powerful enough to destroy entire cities. They have a reputation for appearing where there is conflict, and shrivelling everything up with the Hyper Beam attack. Rampages like this have been known to last upwards of an entire month, and will not end until everything around them has been destroyed. Because they have been known to sink ships as well through the seastorms their rage causes, they are considered legendary among sailors, especially the red/ golden variety. Its big change in behavior is said to be attributed to a structural change occurring in its brain while evolving from Magikarp.
In the beta version of Pokémon Red and Green, Gyarados had the name of Skullkraken.
Shiny Gyarados is a particularly rare variety of Gyarados. While Gyarados are normally blue in color, there are some rare red/ gold scaled Gyarados. Though no more powerful than their more common blue counterparts, red Gyarados are valued for their rarity and individuality. This is caused in Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal and the anime by a radio frequency transmitted by Team Rocket to force the Magikarp to evolve. The red coloration comes from the Magikarp evolving prematurely, and not undergoing the conversion from red to blue scale pigment. Thus, they retain the same color they had as a Magikarp. Red Gyarados are more commonly called Shiny Gyarados, or even Golden Gyarados due to the contrasting coloration.
In Generation II Pokémon games, a red Gyarados at the Lake of Rage is a main part of the plot. After its defeat or capture, a Red Scale is obtained, which can be given to Mr. Pokémon, or Marcus Spanier, in exchange for an Exp. Share. The red Gyarados is the only Pokémon in the Generation II games that will be shiny without fail.
In the anime, one is owned by Misty. At first, she fearfully dislikes Gyarados due to a traumatic experience, but manages to get over the fear, take over the Cerulean City Gym, and add one to her team. The red Gyarados in the anime is caught by Lance, the dragon trainer, to rescue it from Team Rocket. Team Rocket also uses a Gyarados-shaped submarine in early episodes, but trades it for a Magikarp-shaped submarine in later episodes.
Gyarados was noticeably larger in the Indigo Series, but has since become a lot smaller. Gyarados` most powerful attack is said to be Dragon Rage (however, this is not true in the games, given that Dragon Rage only ever does 40 damage), where many other Gyarados appear around the main Gyarados, then they start spinning around at such a speed they became one huge tornado, as seen in Episode #18: Island of The Giant Pokémon.</description>

<description>Lapras is a dual-type Water/Ice Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, it has a Gigantamax form.
Lapras is a large sea Pokémon that resembles a plesiosaur. It has a blue hide with darker blue spots and a cream-colored underside. It has large brown eyes, a short horn on its forehead, and tightly curled ears. It has a long neck and four flippers. The foremost flippers are larger than the hind. On its back is a heavy, gray shell covered in blunt knobs.
Lapras is a gentle, helpful Pokémon that enjoys ferrying people across bodies of water. In the past, its docility made it an easy target for hunters, and it was driven to near-extinction. Recent protection efforts have seen Lapras become overabundant instead, which is now affecting the fish Pokémon numbers in some areas. An intelligent Pokémon, it is able to understand human speech. Lapras have been known to travel in large pods across the seas, spanning both polar and tropical areas. To keep in touch with other of its kind, it sings enchanting melodies. In the anime it was shown that Lapras is able to develop psychic abilities such as telepathy.
As Gigantamax Lapras, it becomes larger in size and more armored. Its shell resembles a cruise ship with four gray and red stripes surrounding it, and it has four spikes on top of its shell with one steel spike resembling a funnel, which has three red clouds surrounding it. The sclera in Lapras` eyes change colors to white, yellow, and blue. A light blue ring of fine thin lines resembling a musical sheet created from ice particles circles around its shell.
5,000 people can ride on the shell of Gigantamax Lapras for a very comfortable ride without any issues. Lapras can use it giant ring to break any icebergs that may prevent it from swimming.
Gigantamax Lapras is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Resonance.</description>

<description>Eevee is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves into one of eight different Pokémon through various methods. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Eevee is the game mascot and starter Pokémon in Pokémon: Let`s Go, Eevee!, as well as for the main characters of Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness and Pokémon Conquest. It is also the rival`s starter Pokémon in Pokémon Yellow, although Professor Oak originally intended to give it to the player.
Eevee is a mammalian, quadruped Pokémon with primarily brown fur. The tip of its bushy tail and its large furry collar are cream-colored. It has short, slender legs with three small toes and a pink paw pad on each foot. Eevee has brown eyes, long pointed ears with dark brown interiors, and a small black nose. Eevee is rarely found in the wild and is mostly only found in cities and towns. However, Eevee is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure that is easily influenced by its environment. This allows it to adapt to a variety of habitats by evolving. Eevee is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Extreme Evoboost.
In Pokémon: Let`s Go, Eevee!, the player starts with a special Eevee known as a Partner Eevee. The Partner Eevee has purple eyes and a lighter shade of fur. These design elements likely taken from the anime, which implemented similar traits starting in the Advanced Generation series. The marking on the tip of a female Partner Eevee is heart-shaped. Before Pokémon Sword and Shield, this trait was unique and wasn`t found on other female Eevee. Partner Eevee has higher base stats and access to moves that normal Eevee do not. Partner Eevee is the only Pokémon capable of performing Bouncy Bubble, Buzzy Buzz, Sizzly Slide, Glitzy Glow, Baddy Bad, Sappy Seed, Freezy Frost, Sparkly Swirl, and the Partner Power, Veevee Volley. In Pokémon Sword and Shield, the unique pattern is present on all female Eevee as a true gender difference.
As Gigantamax Eevee, it has become larger and more fluffy. The fur collar becomes longer with several triangular furs pointing straight up. The right ear has three red clouds surrounding it like a circle. Due to the fur becoming fluffier and luxurious, any enemies caught in it will lose the will to fight due to being enamored by its presence. Due to Gigantamaxing, Eevee becomes even more playful and rambunctious, desiring to play with its opponent and often unintentionally crushing them with its size.

<description>Jolteon is one of the evolutions of Eevee that is caused by radiation from a thunder stone. Jolteon is covered with spiky, bright yellow fur, with white spiky fur surrounding its neck. Its fur sparks with electricity constantly; it can be soft to the touch or turn into sharp needles that can be fired when it is angered. Jolteon is able to gather negative ions from the atmosphere, using the resulting electricity to create lightning bolts of up to 10,000 volts. Its individual cells also create small electrical charges on their own, which combined with the static electricity caused by its body can result in powerful electric-type attacks. It`s very sensitive which causes it to constantly charge as it quickly changes moods. It can also make lightning and cause small thunderstorms. In the Pokémon video games, Jolteon can absorb electric attacks and turn them into HP (Health Point, or Health) with the ability `Volt Absorb`.</description>

It stores thermal energy from the sun, causing its body temperature to skyrocket to more than a range of 1600 degrees Celsius, releasing its flames from an internal sack. Its ability is `Flash Fire` which negates fire-type moves against it and increases its attack by 1.5 times damage if hit by a damaging fire attack.</description>

If met with mollusks, such as Shellder, it cracks the shell and sucks out the insides. Its appearance seems to be based on the ammonite, an extinct cephalapod that resembles a Chambered Nautilus.</description>

If it is flipped upside down, it becomes helpless and defenseless as it is unable to flip over on its own.

<description>Kabutops is the evolved form of Kabuto. It lives in the water, and can move at high speeds by folding its limbs against its body. The creature comes out of the water to hunt. Kabutops is a predator, but its nature of feeding is vampiric; instead of killing its prey, it uses its razor sharp claws to open wounds in its prey, and then drink its blood. It attempts to avoid killing prey, so it may feed at a later date. Kabutops is loosely based on trilobites as a counterpoint to Omanyte and Omastar representing ammonites. This can clearly be seen with the enlarged cephalon and the pygidium and thoracic spines. It was introduced in Pokémon Red and Blue, where the player-character plays a part in reviving the assumed-extinct species by giving a Fossil to the Scientist on Cinnabar Island.</description>

<description>Snorlax is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Munchlax when leveled up with high friendship. It also has a Gigantamax form.
In the Generation I and II games and their remakes, wild Snorlax can be found sleeping in inconvenient locations throughout Kanto. In order to catch one, a Trainer must first awaken it with music from either a Poké Flute or Pokégear set to the Poké Flute channel. A sleeping Snorlax makes a return in Pokémon X and Y, in which it is blocking the player`s way on Route 7.
Snorlax is a huge, bipedal, dark blue-green Pokémon with a cream-colored face, belly, and feet. Its body is composed of mostly its belly, as its limbs are comparatively small. Its head is large with small, pointed ears and two pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw. It has round feet, which both have three claws and a circular brown paw pad, and short arms with five claws on each hand. Snorlax`s bulk makes it the heaviest Normal type.
Snorlax is often found in mountains and forests. It wakes up only to eat, requiring 900 lbs. (400 kg) of food per day before returning to its slumber. It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it to eat even moldy food without feeling any ill effects. It can even handle thorny plants or Muk`s poison. It can also eat while it is resting. Snorlax is docile enough to let children and small Pokémon bounce on its large stomach.
Snorlax can show awesome power when prompted. As Gigantamax Snorlax, seeds and small rocks that were tangled in its belly fur goes through immense growth and a tree spouts upon its belly. The tree has three red clouds surrounding it like a circle. It almost never moves; even when in battle it only slightly lifts its body and attacks by flailing with its arms and legs. However, its attacks are very powerful — Gigantamax Snorlax is considered to be the strongest Dynamax Pokémon to have been discovered.
It is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Pulverizing Pancake and G-Max Move G-Max Replenish.</description>

<description>Articuno is one of the three Legendary Birds along with Zapdos and Moltres. It is a large bird with blue plumage, a bluish-white-feathered chest, a three feathered crest adorning its nose, and a long, sparkling tail. It can create and manipulate ice freely. Its translucent wings are imbued with the essence of frigidity, and the flapping of its wings chills the air, causing the conversion of water particles in the air into snow or ice, causing snow to fall when it flies overhead. In legend, Articuno resides within the confines of icy mountains, because those who have seen its were often doomed explorers scaling such mountains, and therefore it is believed Articuno makes it a point to appear before them and save them.
It is interesting to note that the last letters of its name, "uno" ("one" in Spanish), suggest it is the first of the three legendary bird Pokémon. This is reinforced by the fact that the last letters of the names of its fellow legendary birds suggest that they are the second and third. They are Zapdos ("dos", which is "two" in Spanish) and Moltres ("tres", which is "three" in Spanish).
Articuno`s video game appearances occur in the very confusing mazes of the icy Seafoam Islands, on Route 20, between Fuschia City and Cinnabar Island. It is a unique Pokémon that usually appears alongside Zapdos and Moltres. Since only one of each exists in the games, players usually try to catch the Birds.
Articuno also makes appearances in the anime and manga, also as a unique Pokémon and a general species. They participate in various events and battles. Articuno was initially believed to be the large golden bird Ash saw in the very first episode, but it turned out to actually be Ho-Oh, though the earlier reference was kept in the Red, Blue, Yellow game versions when one looked into a telescope and saw it. Its largest role is in Pokémon: The Movie 2000. Lawrence III creates a battle between the three birds, and Ash Ketchum had to team up with Lugia to stop them. In the beginning of the Battle Frontier challenge in the anime, Noland, the battle factory frontier brain had befriended one. After reuniting with their photographer friend Todd, Ash and its friends hear a rumor that Articuno lives on a certain mountain. After several encounters with Team Rocket, Ash and Todd are saved by Articuno from a snowstorm, and Todd manages to snap a picture of it. Ash`s Charizard did battle with it and Articuno lost by a narrow margin.
In Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, Articuno is the third legendary boss as well as the third legendary bird you battle. He is also the hardest to convince of the three legendary birds that the main hero Pokémon is not responsible for the havocs in the Pokémon World. Absol prevents Articuno from ending the hero and partner by ensuring that Articuno knows the truth.</description>

<description>Zapdos is one of the three Legendary Birds along with Articuno and Moltres. It may be based on the thunderbird. It is a bird with a yellow, angular body and wings. Also behind its main yellow wings is a second pair of thinner, jet-black wings. Its beak is long and extremely sharp. Zapdos, a creature that can freely manipulate electricity, is thought to live in thunderclouds, where it apparently only gains power when struck by lightning. It is seen emerging from clouds while dropping enormous lightning bolts, and even if it does not launch electricity its wings make peculiar crackling and snapping sounds as it flies.
It is interesting to note that the last letters of its name, "dos" ("two" in Spanish), suggest it is the second of the three legendary bird Pokémon. This is reinforced by the fact that the last letters of the names of its fellow legendary birds suggest that they are the first and third. They are Articuno ("uno", which is "one" in Spanish) and Moltres ("tres", which is "three" in Spanish).
Zapdos is found in a Power Plant off the coast of the Rock Tunnel near Cerulean City in Pokémon Red and Blue, and related games. It also plays small roles in the anime and manga. Zapdos is featured in Pokémon The Movie 2000 together with the other two Legendary birds, Articuno and Moltres. It appears that Zapdos communicates through electricity as it shocks Pikachu to communicate. Zapdos also appeared in the 9th Pokémon Movie.</description>

<description>Moltres is one of the three Legendary Birds, along with Articuno and Zapdos. It is a large bird that is literally ablaze with fire, resembling something related to a phoenix. It has an orange body, a small pointed beak, and where its plumage should be are flames of a searing intensity. It can freely create and manipulate fire, and it constantly looses flaming embers from its wings. When its body is injured for any reason, it will head towards a volcano and dip its body in the molten magma to heal its wounds. Moltres is an elusive creature, seen about as rarely as the other two members of the Legendary Bird triad. When Moltres thinks it is in the least bit possible danger, it will summon a flash of fire and seemingly disappear, flying out of sight very fast.
The first video game appearance of Moltres was in Pokémon Red and Blue versions. In these Versions, Moltres was in a blocked off area of Victory Road, only accessible from the end of the cave. However, Moltres was moved from its lair in FireRed and LeafGreen, to Mount Ember, an active volcano, on 1 Island, the first of the new Sevii Islands.
The first official appearance of Moltres in the anime was in the episode that marks the beginning of the Pokémon League, where it lights the torch which is equivalent to the real-life Olympic Torch. It also plays a role in "Pokémon The Movie 2000: The Power of One", along with the other two Legendary Birds (Zapdos and Articuno). It was one of the two birds that the villainous collector, often referred to as both Gelardan and Lawrence III, captured to allow him access to Lugia`s power, but the upset of the balance that occurred as a result nearly caused a worldwide weather catastrophe as Moltres was driven to wage war with its two rivals. They were quelled once Ash and Lugia fulfilled the prophecy related to the legendary birds. In a later episode of Pokémon Chronicles, Ash`s rival Richie encountered a trainer named Silver who wanted to capture Moltres, battling him with its Salamence. Silver is interrupted by Team Rocket members Butch and Cassidy who attempt to kidnap Moltres, rather than catching him fairly. Richie and Silver team up to defeat Butch and Cassidy and rescue Moltres, although the firebird was badly weakened by the Rockets` attack. Silver let Moltres go, wanting to catch him in a fair fight when it was at full strength, although it promised it`d try again.
According to one of the trainers in Blaine`s gym on Cinnabar Island, Blaine decided to become a trainer of Fire-type Pokémon after having been rescued by a fiery bird when lost in the mountains.</description>

<name>Mew</name>
<gender>none/does not apply</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Mew is a Psychic-type legendary Pokémon. It was first introduced as a secret Pokémon in the first generation. Nintendo`s specialists in Pokémon have spoken, in Nintendo`s Pokémon-related speech in 2007, that Mewtwo is more powerful than Mew, therefore being a clone (better from the original: Pokémon Red and Blue and Yellow). Mew appears as a pink feline-esque Pokémon with large feet, big blue eyes, and a very long tail. Its skin is covered with a layer of fine pink hair. By nature, Mew is known to be a playful and kind Pokémon. Its DNA is said to possess the genetic composition of all existing Pokémon species, thus allowing it to use all known Pokémon techniques. In the anime, it is also capable of further teleportation, summoning giant pink bubbles of psychic energy (which serve various purposes such as closing itself in for protection, act as a cushion, or simply for Mew`s amusement of bouncing on), and rendering itself invisible.
In the first generation video games, Mew is mentioned in journal entries found in the Pokémon Mansion on Cinnabar Island stating that it was discovered deep in the jungles of Guyana, South America on July 5 (the year was not specified) and named on July 10, and that it "gave birth" to Mewtwo on Feb. 6. Mew was available at Kiosks during special events held by Nintendo after the release of Red, Blue, and Yellow. However, a glitch exists in these Generation I games that allows the player to capture a level 7 Mew.
Mew plays a role in some of the Pokémon anime films. In Pokémon: The First Movie, Mewtwo was created from a fossilized Mew hair found in the Amazon. A single Mew travels to where Mewtwo is holding its tournament in order to convince it to stop. It also made a short appearance in Mewtwo Returns (a special episode involving the whole of Team Rocket (including Giovanni) and Mewtwo, as well as various other characters.) In Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew, the backdrop revolves around Mew`s mysterious history and how this extremely rare Pokémon came to be so powerful. Also, at the beginning of the movie, a Pokémon "family tree" is shown. The first Pokémon on it is Mew, and the last is Ho-oh. Since Mew contains the genetic composition that is found in every species of Pokémon, Mew has the ability to transform into any Pokémon like Ditto. However, in the anime, Mew does not need to see the Pokémon in order to transform into it.</description>

<description>Chikorita is the Grass-type Starter Pokémon in Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal. One may also get this Pokémon in Pokémon Emerald by completing the Hoenn Dex (not including Jirachi and Deoxys). It is reptilian in appearance, but it has a large leaf sprouting from its head, a collar of crystalline seeds around its neck, and a short tail. Chikorita, by nature, are docile Pokémon that love to soak up the sun`s rays. The leaf serves multiple purposes; in its natural environment, its leaf detects the density of humidity and temperature in the atmosphere to help it seek warm places. The pleasant aroma that wafts from the leaf can be used by Chikorita in battle by waving it around to becalm the foe and keep it at bay. In the Pokémon anime, Ash Ketchum caught a Chikorita early on its adventure through Johto, after saving it from a sudden snowstorm. Chikorita is very affectionate, stubborn, and powerful, often sees Pikachu as a rival for Ash`s affections, and apparently has a crush on Ash. In the episode "Current Events", Chikorita evolves into a Bayleef when Ash was almost in mortal peril.</description>

<description>Bayleef is the evolution of Chikorita and first appeared in Pokémon Gold and Silver. It has a pale yellow body supported by four legs and a rather long neck and tail. On top of its head is a single large leaf. Its most defining trait is the "necklace" of seven tubular leaves that is located around its neck. Each of these curled up leaves contains inside it a tree shoot. From these leaves wafts a spicy scent that has stimulating properties. It can cheer people up, restore their health, make them more energetic and even heighten their drive for competition.
Bayleef is one of the Pokémon that Ash has used in its team. It evolved from Chikorita in the episode "Current Events". Like its pre-evolved form, Bayleef feels a strong bond of affection towards its trainer, which it usually expresses that feeling by trying to climb all over him, a matter complicated by the dramatic increase in mass. Ash used Bayleef in many battles in Johto, including gym battles and Johto League, where it battled against various opponents. Bayleef is currently at Professor Oak`s lab since Ash decided to make a fresh start when going to Hoenn, and therefore left all of his Pokémon except Pikachu with Professor Oak.</description>

It is a human-sized, green creature resembling an apatosaurus, but with stamen-like antennae extending from its forehead and a large flower growing around its collar. Meganium`s antennae are smaller in females than in males.
The pheremones within its flower are its defense against those who would attack it for its size; they give off a fragrance that can instill feelings of peace and calm in all around it, thus suppressing their need to attack Meganium for food. This fragrance is effective enough to affect even a Pokémon like Primeape, which is noted for its unmatched temper. Meganium also has magically natural powers in its breath, which somehow is able to restore life to dead plants and grass.</description>

<description>Cyndaquil is the Fire-type Starter Pokémon in Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal. In Pokémon Emerald you may get Cyndaquil after completing the Hoenn Dex. Cyndaquil are covered with a flame-resistant, dull-yellow fur with a rich streak of blue running from the tip of its snout over its head and spreading out to cover the majority of its back. There are also four spots of red fur on the back. When Cyndaquil is frightened or angry, it can focus its internal energy to produce blazing "spines" of flame from the spots. While it is a quadruped, Cyndaquil is more than capable of maneuvering on two legs. They are based on an echidna.
Cyndaquil are generally timid and not naturally aggressive, and are often seen curled into a ball for protection. This action leaves its back and special flame-emitting vent fur exposed. When predators and enemies stalk too close, Cyndaquil unleashes a furious flame from the vents as a deterrent. If provoked further, Cyndaquil will intensify its flames, creating a smokescreen that will buy it some time to escape.
Cyndaquil has made numerous appearances in the Pokémon anime, mostly under the control of Ash. His Cyndaquil often seemed to be very shy and relaxed, often sleeping. At first, it needed time to warm up and use flamethrower, but with some training from Ash, it is now able to use its flamethrower whenever it wants. It also possesses prodigious dodging capabilities, able to wear opponents down by simply evading long series of attacks over an extended period of time. Cyndaquil is currently at Professor Oak`s lab since Ash decided to make a fresh start when going to Hoenn, and therefore, left all of its Pokémon, except Pikachu, with Professor Oak.</description>

<description>Quilava is the evolution of Cyndaquil. Quilava have long, thin bodies with small forepaws and slightly longer hindpaws, similar to real-life weasels. Their tan fur is slightly darker than Cyndaquil`s, while the blue streak has been lowered to cover their eyes. As per the family line, Quilava sport short, coarse fireproof fur and have special vents on their heads and lower backs. Though they do not have a tail, the lower vents are positioned as to give the illusion of one.
Quilava are noted in the Pokédex to turn their backs toward their opponents in battle as a sign that they are about to use their flame-based abilities in battle, or to intimidate foes by demonstrating their power. Quilava are noted for their speed, and can nimbly evade attacks while scorching their enemies. They can also create gusts of superheated air, albeit to the same effect.</description>

On its back and tail are four red spikes. Totodile has a big and prominent jaw, filled with many sharp teeth; it is strong enough to cut down a tree. It`s very energetic, cheerful and rowdy, and occasionally can be seen running through swampy areas, biting and chomping at everything that moves.
In the anime, Ash acquires a Totodile after a duel with Misty to determine its rightful owner. Ash`s Totodile is rather carefree, fun loving, and loves to dance. It is shown to be friendly towards other Pokémon, and is a fast swimmer, as shown in Pokémon Heroes. Ash used Totodile in many battles throughout Johto, including the Johto League. A Totodile seen in the very first episode of the Johto series was very attached to Jessie from Team Rocket, or rather, her long hair (which Totodile loved to bite) that runs down her back. Ash`s Totodile is currently at Professor Oak`s lab since Ash decided to make a fresh start when going to Hoenn, and therefore, left all of his Pokémon except Pikachu with Professor Oak.</description>

<description>Croconaw is the evolution of Totodile. It opens its huge jaws wide when attacking. If it loses any fangs while biting, new ones will quickly grow back in its place so that it always has 48 fangs. The tips of these fangs are slanted backward. Once Croconaw has clamped its jaws on its foe, it will absolutely not let go. Because the tips of its fangs are forked back like barbed fishhooks, they become impossible to remove when they have sunk in. This means that the prey has no hope of escape. The pattern on Croconaw`s belly vaguely resembles a jungle tunic or loincloth. Croconaw live in or around swamps. When they evolve into Feraligatr, they move into an area where there is a waterfall.</description>

Feraligatrs are massive, Godzilla-like crocodiles with long, blue bodies and four legs, although they may also stand upright on land. Their appendages have sharp claws at the ends, and its jaw is lined with teeth. On its head, back, and tail there are red, jagged scales. As stated in the Pokédex in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, "Feraligatr intimidates its foes by opening its huge mouth. In battle, it will kick the ground hard with its thick and powerful hind legs to charge at the foe with incredible speed."
Feraligatrs are ferocious and have a tendency to lash out at those that come too close. They eat Magikarp and other fish-like Pokémon, as well as larger prey (such as Stantler and Tauros) when they come close enough to the water.</description>

If it spots an enemy, it will cry out loudly to warn its kind. It will also hit the ground with its tail. A Sentret will only sleep when another one is standing guard. The Sentret will wake the others at the first sign of danger. Because of this, if one is separated from its pack, then it will be unable to sleep due to fear.

<description>Furret live in colonies with tunnels much too small for normal Pokemon to traverse, yet it is a perfect fit for the slim build of Furret as it hides from the outside world at the surface by traversing through these tunnels like gophers. These tunnel colonies become very complex, especially if they are very deep, and can potentially stretch for miles. Occasionally, these colonies are found intertwined with Diglett colonies. The Furret evolves from Sentret at level 15.
Furret`s rudimentary paws and legs are deceptively nimble, making Furret a quick, unpredictable predator especially skillful at hunting Rattata, its main prey. Also, the fur of the Pokemon is thicker than it appears, and Furret can fluff up its fur to make itself look much stronger and larger than it actually is as an intimidation tactic towards potential foes.

Hoothoot are also known for having precise senses of time, due to a special mechanism in their brain that measures the rotation of the earth. Properly trained, they can be more accurate than all but the most precise of clocks. In nature, they always begin hooting at the same time every night.</description>

Its round head has two piercing, red eyes and two large "eyebrows". These eyebrows help balance Noctowl while it is flying to increase its aerodynamics. When hunting, Noctowl puts its prodigious eyesight to good use to hunt down prey without fail. It is also very good at sneaking up to its victims unnoticed thanks to its supple, soft-feathered wings that allow it to fly without making any noise. When a Noctowl needs to ponder especially deep thoughts, it can rotate its head 180 degrees, which serves to increase its intellectual faculties.
In the anime, a shiny Noctowl has been part of Ash`s team during his travels in Johto. Ash frequently used his Noctowl to explore an area from the sky, or to puncture Team Rocket`s hot-air balloon. Ash used it in many battles throughout Johto, but it is currently living in Professor Oak`s lab since Ash decided to make a fresh start and leave all of his Pokémon except for Pikachu when he left for Hoenn.</description>

A Ledyba communicates with others through an aromatic fluid excreted from the points where its legs meet its thorax.

Ledian is a nocturnal insect, active mainly during the night and sleeping in curled-up leaves during the day. Countless Ledian live in outdoor areas located a good distance away from the polluted atmospheres of cities, for the star-lit skies are always clearer in these clean lands than in the light pollution of urban areas. Ledian have an affinity to stars for good reason; They take their energy from the light of the stars in order to live healthily. When many stars are visible, the Ledian will sprinkle a mysterious, glowing powder whilst fluttering about.</description>

The web can be called Spinarak`s "second nervous system" because the Pokémon is able to determine the type of prey that has become trapped simply through the vibrations that are created.
In the anime, there is a small town whose police force uses Spinarak to fight crime, honoring a Spinarak that had caught a criminal called the black arachnid in the past. This was shown in the episode Spinarak attack.</description>

Ariados` feet end in hooks that allow it to grip well enough to walk on vertical surfaces and on horizontal surfaces upside-down. Ariados uses its nest as a base of sorts. A strand of silk is constantly spun from its rear that leads back to its nest. This allows it to wander in search of food, which it usually does at night. This is in contrast to its unevolved form, Spinarak, which instead waits patiently for its prey to come to its web.</description>

Its habitat is the dark depths of the ocean floor. In the absence of any other light, Chinchou sees its surroundings and communicates by shooting positive and negative charged electricity particles between the tips of its antennae, creating an electric current and thus light. This can be said to be a form of bioluminescence.

<description>Pichu, known as the "Tiny Mouse" species of Pokémon, are the pre-evolved version of Pikachu. They stand at 1`00" and weight 4.4 lbs. Their cheeks are pink, and they have small, plump bodies with short, jagged tails, and large ears. They are not skilled at storing electricity, so when amused or startled, they often discharge jolts of electricity strong enough to affect adult humans. This lack of control becomes more stable as they grow older. The electricity that they do manage to keep stored is limited by their small electrical pouches in their cheeks. When the air is dry or on stormy days, they charge much more easily, leaving the sound of crackling static electricity emanating from them. They play with each other by touching tails to set off sparks, which also acts as a test of courage. They run the risk of shorting each other out, and scaring themselves into a crying fit with the flash of sparks that emanates from them. In the anime, it is said that a Pichu cannot use electric attacks without hurting itself. This is a feature not prominently featured in the games.
Pichu first appeared in Pokémon Gold and Silver, and is one of many pre-evolutions introduced into the series. At one point, a Nintendo GameCube game called Pichu Bros: Party Panic was in development but never released, featuring Pichu as the main character. Instead, the game was integrated into Pokémon Channel as an important part of the story-line.</description>

Cleffa first appears in Pokémon Gold and Silver, as one of the several pre-evolutions introduced into the series.
Cleffa love to stick their tongues out and are often seen hanging around other baby Pokémon such as Igglybuff. For unknown reasons, possibly due to its unusual star-shaped silhouette, when lots of meteors illuminate the night sky, sightings of Cleffa strangely increase. Some people believe that they came to the Pokémon universe on a meteor. If the impact site of any meteorite is found, this Pokémon is certain to be within the immediate area. On nights with many shooting stars, Cleffa can be seen dancing in a ringlike formation. They dance through the night and stop only at the break of day, when these Pokémon quench their thirst with the morning dew. Like Staryu, it is a Starshape Pokémon- consequently, scientists in the Pokémon universe are trying to find a connection between the two. In the same way its evolved form Clefairy loves the moon, Cleffa are fond of shooting stars.</description>

Like its evolutions Jigglypuff and Wigglytuff, Igglybuff`s body shares many properties with a balloon. It is very soft, elastic and flexible and somewhat feels and smells like a marshmallow. This enables it to bounce a long way, to the extent that Igglybuff finds it more efficient to move around by bouncing instead of walking on its two short legs.
Although Igglybuff too has the notorious singing ability of its evolutionary chain, its vocal cords are not yet fully developed in this early stage of its life. A prolonged singing effort results in Igglybuff turning a deeper and deeper pink as it strains itself, finally ending up damaging its throat. Igglybuff tends to gargle with clear saltwater to soothe itself. Igglybuff is first introduced in Pokémon Gold and Silver as one of several of the pre-evolved Pokémon introduced in the game.</description>

<description>Togepi is a baby Pokémon that hatches from an egg. The Pokédex says that this Pokémon`s "shell is filled with joy" and that it will bring happiness to its trainer as it travels along with him/her. In the Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal games, Togepi first appears as a mystery egg given to the player by a minor character called "Mr. Pokémon", which he/she has to take back to Professor Elm. In FireRed and LeafGreen a character living in the Sevii Islands will give you a Togepi egg, but this event happens only after obtaining the National Pokédex. Like all infant Pokémon, on the day a Togepi hatches, it develops a parental relationship with the first person it sees. (for example, the Togepi would think of the first female it sees as its mother)
In the Pokémon anime, Togepi is the second second-generation Pokémon to be introduced as a character before the release of Pokémon Gold and Silver (Ho-oh was the first). Ash Ketchum discovers an egg in the ancient ruins at Grandfather Canyon. He carries this egg around until the episode "Who Gets to Keep Togepi?". The egg hatches, and after a long dispute it is decided that Misty will keep the newly-hatched Pokémon. Since then, she grows inseparable to it and carries it around everywhere, going frantic whenever it gets lost. She usually keeps it in her backpack when she thinks that it needs protection. The only attacks that it is shown to use are Charm, and more notably, Metronome (which it learned by trying it after witnessing another Pokémon using it), which usually saves Ash and his friends from mortal peril; in one instance, it teleported them out of danger, another, it created a huge explosion, and in another used Reflect.
In a later episode in season six within the Advanced Generation, Misty travels to Hoenn to meet up with Ash, Brock, May, and Max. Due to one of Team Rocket`s plans going wrong, they end up in "Mirage Kingdom", a place where people praise Togepi for they believe it will be their savior. Togepi ends up going into a mirage, followed by Ash and his crew, to discover a Togepi Paradise in ruins. To defend it, it evolves into a Togetic, a Pokémon that makes its first Anime appearance and defeats the villain of "Mirage Kingdom". It then makes the difficult decision of staying in the Togepi Paradise to protect it instead of continuing with Misty. In the end, Misty released Togetic so it can defend Mirage Kingdom and returned to her duties as the Cerulean City gym leader.
The English DVD release of Mewtwo Strikes Back incorrectly refers to Togepi as Pokémon #152.</description>

<description>Togetic is a highly auspicious species. It is associated with good fortune and happiness, but it is said that it will grant its boons and affection only to kind-hearted, caring people. In fact, it will even grow sad itself if it is in mean-spirited company for a prolonged period of time. Togetic`s rudimentary wings do not permit it to actually fly, but it has in lost time learned to remain floating in midair without even using them. In the new Diamond and Pearl games, Togetic is granted an evolution, Togekiss, using the Shiny Stone.
In the anime, Misty`s Togepi evolves into Togetic in order to protect the Togepi indigenous to the mystical Mirage Kingdom from a villain. After peace is restored, it decides to remain there in order to watch over its fellow Pokémon and Misty releases it, parting with a Pokémon she has had for most of the series` original generation.
Togetic later appeared in the 11th movie, Near the waters with its partner, Riolu.</description>

<description>Natu are very small, spherical, green birds with underdeveloped, textured wings, red talons, red tail feathers, and a red plume on each of their foreheads. Since their wings are not fully grown, Natu are unable to fly and therefore must hop around in order to get around. As a result of this, however, Natu`s jumping abilities are quite developed and they can hop great distances. They are diurnal herbivores that live in savanna areas. They forage for food on the ground by custom, but when a lack of food on the ground is apparent, Natu turn to the trees that grow in the savannas. With their strong jumping ability in their talons, Natu may either charge forward and quite literally run up the trunk of a small tree to reach a branch or use both their legs and their flapping wings to propel themselves onto higher tree branches well over seven feet off the ground. Once there, they peck at and feed on the tree`s recently grown shoots.
Natu have a peculiar nature in observing. Whenever they are seen, they always appear to be looking at something intently in particular. When a human makes eye contact with a Natu, the Pokemon will unfailingly stare back intently at him or her without hopping to safety, even though humans in comparison should be intimidatingly large. However, if that human moves even slightly, the Natu will suddenly hop away to safety.</description>

<description>Xatu has a colorful and elaborate plumage with two red eyes imprinted on its breast; making the Pokémon look like an Native American totem pole. In Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl, male Xatu have three yellow stripes along its lower area, while female Xatu only have two. It possesses the power of precognition, rendering it able to see into the past and the future. It often remains motionless for an entire day staring at the sun while it views the past and present. It will also meditate from morning to sunset without moving. Xatu is said to be overwhelmed by the visual feedback of seeing two different time periods at once, or in terror at seeing the perils the future holds. In the game it is said that in some South American countries, Xatu is highly revered as a mystical Pokémon for its abilities.</description>

<description>Mareep are blue skinned sheep or lamb-like creatures which have long, striped tails with a yellow ball at the tip. Their fleece is yellow, while their bodies are a dark blue color. Their ears are a rounded cone shape and channel the electricity that they keep in their fleece. Mareep are said to build up a stockpile of static electricity by rubbing the fluffy woolen fleece on their body, with that of other Mareep. The electricity is then stored in their fleece, and will shock predators on contact. The more electricity that is stored, the brighter the ball on the tip of a Mareep`s tail is thought to glow. In summer, the fleece is fully shed, but would grow back within a week. Mareep also are thought to store air in the fleece, enabling it to control its body temperature whatever the weather.</description>

It has black stripes on its ears and its long tail, and it has small, beady eyes that look like black dots. It has a blue ball on the tip of its tail. Flaaffy usually likes to sit upright, although it can stand on two legs if necessary. Its wool quality changes as it matures so that it can generate a high amount of strong static electricity while still having a small amount of wool. Its bare, electric-resistant, parts of its hides enable it to prevent electrocution. As a result of storing too much, it develops patches even where wool won`t grow.</description>

Ampharos has powerful light abilities, its main light sources being the large orbs on its tail and head, and because of this is often used as a beacon in lighthouses, and mythical legend says that these lights can even be seen from outer space. Before the introduction of modern technology, Ampharos` light was used to communicate between long distances, in much a similar way to smoke signals.</description>

<description>Bellossom is a diurnal plant Pokémon. It evolves from Gloom if exposed to a Sun Stone. Bellossom`s petals can rotate, and they usually do when it is absorbing sunlight. The color of their leaves vary from a sickly brown and gray to a fluorescent yellow and red, depending on how much sunlight it has absorbed in the past few hours. When its petals are moving, either due to rotating or dancing, they rub together to make relaxing, bell-like sounds. The petals on its head also create a sweet scent.
It is also noted that a Bellossom will be even more beautiful if it was an especially rancid Gloom. The worse it smells as a Gloom, the prettier its petals will be as a Bellossom. Although naturally a peaceful and friendly Pokémon, it can be very territorial and violent fights can break out if there is an intruder or a challenger. Despite this, it is very social in areas outside of its self-determined territory, and the most common time to find a group of Bellossom together is when they all meet in one location to dance. It is said that these dances summon the sun.
Its Japanese name, "Kireihana", translates to "Beautiful" (kirei) and "Flower" (hana).</description>

<description>Marill is an aquatic mouse Pokémon. Marill`s tail floats like a buoy because it is filled with oil, which is less dense than water. When fishing at a fast-running stream, Marill wraps its tail around a tree. Since the tail is stretchy and flexible, it allows the Pokémon to get food and still stay safely anchored. Otherwise, when in a lake, it uses the buoy-qualities of its tail to keep itself suspended as the rest of its body dives underwater to feed on aquatic plants. Its fur is impermeable, which keeps it dry, and that allows it to swim through water at high speed without being slowed by the water`s resistance.
In the Pokémon Anime, Tracey, the Pokémon Observer from the Orange Islands, has a Marill which he uses on multiple occasions.</description>

<description>Azumarill is the evolved form of Marill. Azumarill resembles a blue, bipedal rabbit with a large, ellipsoid body, long blue ears with red insides, and a blue ball on the end of its thin, elastic black tail. The white bubble-like pattern on its lower stomach helps it to camouflage itself from potential predators when it is in the water.
Azumarill`s long ears act as sensors to identify sounds even in fast running rivers. Otherwise, when alone, Azumarill plays in water as a natural pastime, though it must roll up its elongated ears to prevent the sensitive sensory materials inside them from getting wet. The ball at the end of its tail can act as a sensor and guide it while under water. It can make thick, liquid balloons out of thin air with the saliva-water stored in its body. If it spots a drowning Pokémon in any body of water, it fashions such air balloons and jumps in to give the troubled Pokémon air balloons to help it breathe.
In the Pokémon anime, Paul owned an Azumarill which he used in a gym battle against Roark. Although it knew powerful Water attacks like Hydro Pump, it lost to Roark`s Geodude, which prompted Paul to give it to a Pokémon trainer passing by, being disappointed by its strength.</description>

<description>Politoed, a frog Pokémon, is an alternate evolution of Poliwhirl that is obtained by trading it to another player with a King`s Rock. Politoed has green skin which turns yellow at its paws, lower jaw and belly. Its belly is adorned with a green spiral mark, similar to its pre-evolutionary forms. On top of its head grows a long blue hair that is curled in a manner similar to the spiral. Politoed dominates over its related species. When Poliwags and Poliwhirls hear its cry, they come running to its side from far and wide. Its status is displayed in the form of its single blue curly hair, which is an object of reverence among its "subjects." The longer and more curled the hair, the better respected the Politoed who supports it.
In the anime, Politoed is one of the Pokémon used by Misty. She obtained it when her Poliwhirl was withdrawn in its Poké Ball while holding the King`s Rock Ash had previously won as a Pokémon sumo tournament prize. Misty`s Politoed is strong and cheerful. It is frequently seen joyfully dancing around.</description>

<description>Hoppip are small, spherical creatures, with long leaves protruding from their head. They have small, gripping feet and ears disproportionate to their body, used to listen for winds. Hoppip have extremely petite and almost weightless bodies, and are susceptible to strong winds due to this. When a Hoppip feels a gale approaching, it will lock the leaves on its head with the leaves of other Hoppip, in an attempt to avoid being blown away. If a Hoppip is by itself when in heavy winds, it may grip the ground with its feet to prevent this. Despite the dangers Hoppip face in strong winds, they enjoy gentle breezes and can float in the calmest of winds, which can carry them across vast distances.</description>

The leaves have turned into a large yellow flower. The flower on its head blossoms at 64 degrees Fahrenheit. As the temperature increases, the flower gradually opens further. This allows Skiploom to be used as a thermometer. It is capable of floating in the air, a skill it uses to get closer to the sun in order to better absorb the sunlight. When the sunlight is strong, its ability, Chlorophyll, increases its speed. When it rains, the flower instantly closes and Skiploom hides under a tree to avoid getting wet.</description>

They take advantage of their light weight and fluffy, buoyant cotton balls to take to the skies. They are very adept at catching the warm southern winds and navigating their way to any location in the world, typically overseas and until they encounter a cold air current, whereupon they will begin landing. While floating, Jumpluff release spores that propagate its offspring around the world. This method of reproduction is reminiscent of dandelions.</description>

On its thin tail is a three fingered hand-like appendage that is very dexterous. It provides both propulsion and balance while Aipom leaps from tree to tree. Aipom is not aggressive by nature and will attempt to tire its natural opponents through dexterous dodging of the opponent`s attacks in hope that the enemy will be discouraged and leave. Otherwise, if the enemy is persistent, the Aipom will try to retreat, but if it is unable to, it will attack by diving at its opponent from the trees.
In the anime, an Aipom steals Ash`s hat, and follows his group around until Ash battles and captures it. Ash`s Aipom is quite attached to him, getting incredibly jealous when it sees Pikachu on Ash`s shoulder. Aipom has the distinction of being the only Pokemon aside from Pikachu that Ash brought with him to Sinnoh, although inadvertently. Aipom seems to enjoy contests, and Dawn believes it prefers contests over battles. In "Throwing the Track Switch!", Ash trades Aipom for Dawn`s Buizel because both Pokemon seemed more interested in the other trainer`s training. In "Journey to the Unknown", Dawn`s Aipom evolves into Ambipom.</description>

<description>Sunflora is the evolved form of Sunkern. Sunflora is a diurnal sunflower Pokémon; unlike its unevolved form Sunkern, it is wholly inactive at night. However, it is very active and playful during the day when the sun is bright. Like Bellossom, it evolves using a Sun Stone. Sunflora prefer hot climates; their foliage becomes more colorful and elaborate as the temperature rises. Sunflora unfurl their petals and absorb sunlight for energy. It is possible for a Sunflora to absorb too much sunlight, though. When this happens, its head and petals become engorged and very heavy, which is dangerous for a Sunflora, since it can wilt and possibly get sick. At night, the petals are furled, covering Sunflora`s face.
A Sunflora is constantly soaking up sunlight and moving around in a blissful fashion. In preparation for winter, Sunflora will migrate to warmer and sunnier areas, so as not to lose the vital source of their energy. Sunflora like to live in flower patches. They do their best to stay hidden among the other flowers, but usually they are very noticeable.</description>

Quagsire always bear an absent-looking facial expression. This is likely due to Quagsire`s easy-going nature. It hunts by staying still in the water with its mouth open, waiting for small prey to swim into its mouth. It doesn`t move, and therefore, doesn`t get hungry. It`s not uncommon that a fishermen`s hook will get caught in the gaping mouth of a feeding Quagsire. Trying to eat what it has caught, the Quagsire would try to swallow, and end up pulling the fishermen off his boat and into the water. Male Quagsire have larger fins on their backs. They wait at the bottom of lakes waiting for prey to wander into its mouth. It also loves eating cherries.</description>

An Espeon`s fur is used to sense air currents, allowing it to predict the weather, as well as the actions of its opponent in battle. Its forked tail quivers when this occurs. A red jewel rests on its head, and glows whenever Espeon uses its psychic abilities. Espeon are described as being very loyal to their trainers once they consider them worthy. They are also said to develop precognitive abilities in order to protect their trainers, Espeon become enabled to see into the future to identify potential threats. Eevee evolves into Espeon by having a high happiness level and leveling up during the day. A Sun Shard item can also be used in Pokémon XD, a Sun Ribbon in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue, Red, Explorers of Time, and Explorers of Darkness. Espeon`s name is derived from "ESP" and the suffix "-eon", as with every evolution of Eevee.</description>

<description>Murkrow is a small black crow with red eyes. The top of its head is styled as a witch`s hat and its tail bristles out like a broomstick. Murkrow is rather unpopular in the Pokémon world. Its dismal appearance and nocturnal nature have long caused it to be considered an omen of ill fortune to all who see it. If a Murkrow finds itself wounded, it fights back by leading its pursuer to dark mountain trails in an attempt to get him hopelessly lost in the darkness.
Murkrow is also attracted to bright, shiny objects, which it collects to stash in its nest. This, of course, leads to many arguments between Murkrow and Meowth, who both share a common love of stashing things - and taking from each other! It does not hesitate to steal such objects if necessary and has even been known to attempt to snatch rings off their owner`s fingers (and complete strangers too, for that matter). With the addition of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, it is revealed that some Murkrow are servants to its evolved form, Honchkrow, who spends all of its time preening and ordering the Murkrow around. Also with Diamond and Pearl`s release, Murkrow, like many other Pokémon, have gender differences. In this case, Males have a taller "hat" - technically, the crest that resembles a three-pointed witch hat - than females would. Murkrow can only be found wild in the Pokémon Diamond Version in Eterna Forest, while Misdreavus can only be found in Pokémon Pearl at the same location.</description>

It lacks a nose, has thick, flowing "hair", and large, yellow eyes with red irises. It appears to wear a necklace of red pearls. Misdreavus lives deep in dark caves. It projects frightening screeching and wailing noises, as well as creepy, sobbing cries, at enemy Pokemon it encounters in the caves, so as to build up a level of fright strong enough so that the Pokemon will flee. Misdreavus` pearl necklace apparently serves as its means for feeding by absorbing the fearful feelings of targets for nutrition.
In the event that a human, trepid or otherwise, enters a cave area inhabited by a Misdreavus, the Pokemon will attempt to drive him or her out by biting and pulling at the intruding human`s hair, which is used for defense.</description>

They always have the similarities of a flat body with black color and one medium-size eye. They always reside in mysterious chambers, only with other Unown, always stuck on walls.
Unown is featured in Spell of the Unown as the main antagonists. The Unown create an Entei to befriend a young girl and grant all of the girl`s wishes: in the girl`s case, turning the town she lives in into crystal. Ash and friends convince the girl that Entei is not her true father, since her father was lost on an archeological dig in an Unown temple. The Unown, overpowered by the girl`s current thoughts, became unable to control their powers and larger areas were turning into crystal. Entei saves them all by attacking the Unown, sending them all back to their dimension. It has also been revealed that Dialga and Palkia live in the same dimension as the Unown.</description>

If a person gets near the head, it reacts to the person`s scent and bites. The head doesn`t need to sleep, so it watches over its surroundings twenty four hours a day. Girafarig`s name is a palindrome in both English and Japanese, although the Japanese name`s palindromic nature is not evident in romanised form.</description>

<description>Pineco is a bagworm that resembles a pine cone in appearance. It is usually inactive, hanging from forest trees, where it waits for its prey of small flying insects to come to it. Pineco are capable of spitting out a sticky liquid that hardens when exposed to air. This has multiple uses, an example being Pineco using it to glue pieces of bark to themselves for protection, making them bigger and their hide more durable, much like the bagworm in real life. Like Voltorb and Electrode, Pineco explodes when startled or annoyed.
In the Pokémon anime, Brock catches a Pineco in the episode Goin` Apricorn! to save it from Jessie`s Arbok. It often exploded, no matter what its mood was, but it lost this habit later on when it evolved into a Forretress.</description>

<description>Forretress is a bagworm as classified by the Pokédex, but its true appearance is unknown because it is always hidden inside a steel shell, the only visible part inside being its eyes. The shell itself has two parts: inner and outer. The inner shell is brick red and features four protrusions that look like small cannons. The outer shell is gray and pockmarked, like the surface of the moon. Forretress opens its shell only when it is catching prey, but it does so at such a quick pace that it is impossible to discern the nature of what lies inside, much less attack it while it is unprotected. Forretress can also shoot out bits of the shell for offensive purposes.
In the Pokémon anime, Brock`s Pineco evolves into a Forretress in the episode Entei At Your Own Risk. It is notable for being the only Pokémon he brought with him to Hoenn, and he has since left it at the gym in his hometown of Pewter City.</description>

<description>Dunsparce is a land snake based on the tsuchinoko, a legendary snake-like cryptid from Japan. It has a yellow hourglass shaped body, two tiny wings on its sides, a drill for a tail, and two spikes under its chin. Its underbelly is blue, as well as the markings on its back. Dunsparce lives in caves and deep underground in nests of complex design. Its rudimentary wings enable it to hover just above the ground, providing it with an alternate method of motion besides crawling. Despite these wings and bug-like appearance, Dunsparce is solely a normal type Pokémon.</description>

<description>Gligar is a purple scorpion that is able to glide from a leathery membrane it has that functions as wings. Gligar makes its home on steep cliffs. When it spots prey, it lets go of the cliff`s face, spreads its wings and glides silently and effortlessly towards its target, as if it were sliding. This catches its victim by surprise when it flies straight to its face. It then uses its claws and pincers to secure its hold on the opponent`s face and injects it with poison from its tail barb to paralyze the prey. It is the first Flying-type Pokémon that is unaffected by Electric-type attacks. Ash Ketchum caught this Pokémon.</description>

<description>Steelix is a large serpentine Pokémon that has a steel body with several spikes and a large jaw. The male has two spikes on each side of its jaw while the female only has one spike on each side. It is said that an Onix evolves into Steelix when one lives to be 100 or more, then the pressures exercised on its stone body become so high that it is compressed into a composition harder than diamond. Steelix continues to burrow underground like it did as an Onix, but it reaches far greater depths, reaching records of up to 0.6 miles (900 metres) while heading for the Earth`s core.</description>

<description>Granbull is a large, purple, bipedal bulldog with a pair of imposing, heavy fangs protruding from its lower jaw. The lower jaw is quite developed and, taken together with the fangs, heavy enough that Granbull must constantly decide between tipping its head back for balance and tilting its head down for decreased energy exertion. As its large mouth and fangs are built specifically for offense, Granbull can bite with a crushing amount of power. Granbull`s vicious appearance is a natural intimidation tactic meant to discourage any other Pokémon from assaulting it. In spite of its appearance, however, it is rather timid and easily spooked, and it only defends itself in retaliation to an assault upon it. When it is attacked by another Pokémon in the wild, Granbull flails about with its limbs to ward off its attacker.</description>

<description>Qwilfish is a porcupinefish-like fish that has a round body with many toxin-containing spikes and a teardrop-shaped tail. The spikes give it trouble swimming, but it also has defensive measures against predators. Qwilfish can swallow large quantities of water in very short notice, causing itself to inflate to a much larger size, which it uses to intimidate larger opponents. If the opponent isn`t scared, Qwilfish uses the pressure of the water it swallowed to shoot out its toxic spikes at, thus weakening, the opponent.</description>

<description>Scizor is a human-size mantis similar to its evolutionary predecessor Scyther, with a thick, metallic red exoskeleton and crab-like claws. It is tougher and stronger than Scyther, but has lost its predecessor`s speed and ability to fly. Instead, it spreads its wings to cool off, and flaps them very rapidly to heat up, or to blow air to cool itself off. Its demeanor changes, as well. While Scyther is a mantis-like predator, striking fast and simply evading potential pursuers, Scizor is more crab-like, with a conservative, defensive demeanor, in keeping with its greater defensive ability and lesser speed. Once it engages its foe, either in the wild or at the direction of a Pokémon Trainer in a Pokémon battle, however, it behaves more like Scyther, striking quickly with its powerful claws, raking more than pinching, and relying on its startling agility to evade attacks.</description>

<description>Shuckle is resemblant of a scale insect. Its soft yellow body has four legs and is covered by a hard, vase-like red shell which has eight openings for Shuckle to stick its head and four appendages out of. It makes its home amid rocks, withdrawing into its rock-like shell and hiding among, under or within them. Shuckle employs a fluid secreted by its toes to dissolve rocks and carve them in a shape fit for its nest, the fluids are also occasionally used offensively against enemy Pokémon. Shuckle`s diet consists of berries, which it stores inside its shell to eat later. If stored long enough, the berries will eventually decompose and mix with Shuckle`s natural fluids to form a viscous liquid that makes a healing beverage aptly called "berry juice".It also notably has the best defence/special defence through the game.</description>

Growing from its head is a large T-shaped horn, which is flanked on either side by a smaller antenna. Heracross is a powerful but docile Pokémon. Its natural habitat is forests and its diet consists of tree sap, nectar and honey. Its strength is such that it can topple large trees if it so wished. Heracross`s main weapon is its large horn, of which it is particularly proud. However, it only uses it in the wild to deter its foes, not hurt them.
In the Pokémon anime, Ash catches a Heracross in the episode A Sappy Ending. The Heracross is powerful, but also is distracted by sap, to the point where it tries to feed off the nectar of Ash`s Bulbasaur`s flower bulb when Bulbasaur is in sight. It is currently at Professor Oak`s lab.</description>

<description>Ursaring is a large (although arboreal) bear with a yellow ring on its stomach. Ursaring eats food obtained from digging deep underground as well as berries from trees. Ursaring can hibernate through an entire winter without any food. Ursaring`s sense of smell is among the most developed of all Pokémon; it can detect subtle differences in scents. For this reason, Ursaring is sometimes used by police in the Pokémon universe, both as a strong enforcer, and as an explosive-sniffing Pokémon. If criminals are hiding in trees, it can use its claws to cut down the tree.
Its Japanese name, "Ringuma", originates from "ring" (ringu) and "bear" (kuma). In the anime, Ursaring is caught by Paul, after it is angered by Turtwig.</description>

<description>Magcargo is a snail composed of magma with a shell on its back. The shell is actually a thin outgrowth of its skin that hardened due to cooling of the air, in spite of the fact that it lives in the heat of volcanic craters. The shell is brittle and fragile enough that touching it will cause it to break and crumble, though Magcargo "grows" back its shell passively in a short amount of time. Magcargo has a body temperature of approximately 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Since Magcargo is composed of molten lava, when traveling at its slow pace it leaves parts of its continually hardening body on the ground behind it, thus decreasing its physical size. To lose too much of its mass is potentially deadly, so Magcargo routinely restores its size and vitality by dipping its body into volcanic pools of magma.</description>

<description>Corsola is a dual-type Water/Rock Pokémon introduced in Generation II.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
In Galar, Corsola has a Ghost-type regional form. It evolves into Cursola starting at level 38.
Corsola is a small, pink, roundish Pokémon with branch-like growths on its back, which are similar to coral. There is a smaller, blunt horn on its forehead, and it has black, oval eyes. It has a white underside, which speckles towards the sides. Its four legs and two arms are blunt and stubby.
Found in the warm shallow waters of southern seas, Corsola requires clean water to live. If its habitat is dirty, the growths on its back become discolored and degenerate. However, when it is healthy, its growths regularly shed and grow back. It is able to regrow them over the course of a single night. It forms large social groups. Occasionally, these groups get so large that people may live atop them, as is the case in Pacifidlog Town. Corsola`s horn is a prized material, commonly used for jewelry and carving as seen in the anime. Smaller Pokémon like Seadra and Luvdisc are sometimes sheltered by Corsola`s branches, and even offer it protection from foes.
Galarian Corsola were wiped out by sudden changes in ocean temperature caused by a meteor impact, turning them into Ghost-types. Its body is a bleached white with half-closed pink eyes and a perpetual frown, and its arms and branches have a distinctly semitransparent appearance to them; the branches can be used to take root inside and drain the life force of others.
The branches cannot cause injures or pain, but they immobilize the victim until Galarian Corsola lets them go. They are commonly found in the remains of prehistoric seas, and while they can be mistaken for ordinary rocks, they will curse anybody who kicks them by accident.
In the Alola region, Mareanie and Toxapex are natural predators of Corsola. However, they do not fulfill those roles in the Galar region, having not realized the branches of Corsola are delicious.</description>

<description>Remoraid is a Remora-based suckerfish that scavenges for food and has a somewhat symbiotic relationship with Mantine. Remoraid will attach itself to the underbelly of Mantine with its dorsal fin, eating scraps of food that Mantine drops as well as the parasites on them that causes them to itch. In return, the Mantine helps defend the Remoraid from enemies. When not scavenging for food, Remoraid will strike down its own prey with precise accuracy using fast streams of airborne water, which Remoraid shoots from its mouth using abdominal muscles. Remoraid can move faster through the water by blasting water from its mouth in the opposite direction of where it intends to move.</description>

Octillery is a nesting creature, in that it sleeps in burrows it prepares; however, its nests are temporary structures only, and it rarely uses the same nest two nights in a row.</description>

<description>Delibird resembles the rockhopper penguin, or possibly a snowy owl. It has red and white plumage and is always pictured carrying a sack with it, giving it a Santa Claus-like impression, although its "sack" is actually a long wavery tail, like a ribbon. Delibird is said to make its home at the edge of steep cliffs. It spends all day searching for food, which it stores in its sack/tail and brings back to its chicks. Delibird are known to save the lives of many lost and starved mountaineers by sharing their food with them.
On the other hand, a Delibird under attack will fling its stored food at the opponent as a projectile weapon. This is perhaps the basis for its signature attack, Present, which is an attack only Delibird can learn, as well as the only attack Delibird can learn naturally (through leveling up). In the video games, Delibird is a relatively rare Pokémon; it appears in icy caves, during swarms in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, and as a Shadow Pokémon in Pokémon Colosseum. Delibird can also be caught in Icefall Cave on Four Island of the Sevii Islands, only in Fire Red.
Delibird`s anime debut was in the episode "Dues and Don`ts," in which a Delibird belonging to Team Rocket follows Jessie, James, and Meowth around under orders to collect the enormous debt the three have amassed during the years with constant requests for Pokémon-shaped mechas and other devices. This Delibird appears in several episodes in the series set in Johto. Another Delibird, a helper of Santa Claus, appeared in "Delibird`s Present," an episode of the Pikachu`s Winter Vacation 3 holiday special also shown as part of Pokémon Chronicles.</description>

Its large and well-developed wings enable it to briefly leap over the sea`s surface if it builds up enough speed, in a manner similar to some real aquatic species. Mantine is a filter feeder, like whales; its diet consists of most things that happen to enter its mouth while swimming.</description>

Houndoom is a feared predator among Pokémon, with its howl being likened to the howl of the Grim Reaper in legend. Just the sound of its howl is enough to send all other Pokémon which hear it hurrying back to the safety of their nests.</description>

<description>Stantler is a Pokémon with large, curved antlers. These antlers change the flow of the air, causing the space around them to act as a distorted reality, and leaving other beings around the Stantler confused and lost in their senses. This allows it to create hallucinations to aid it in battle or allow it to escape. The antlers are considered art in the Pokémon world, causing the Stantler to almost be hunted to extinction as the trading market of the antlers reached very high prices. The orbs on fallen antlers is often grounded up to a powder that helps people sleep. Stantler`s name is derived from stag, meaning a male deer, and antler, referring to the horn-like growths on its head.</description>

The fluid is used to mark the boundaries of its territory and print its footprints on the backs of its fellows once they reach maturity. Over 5,000 distinctive marks left by the species have been found in the Pokémon world.
Smeargle has its "Sketch" technique, which is unique to Smeargle. When used, it will replace itself permanently with the last attack technique used by an opponent Pokémon against Smeargle. It learns Sketch every ten levels. There are a few attacks Sketch cannot copy, (Such as Chatots main attack Chatter) but it can learn nearly every attack in the game.</description>

The Pokémon that it evolves into is based upon the attack and defense statistics of the Tyrogue at the point of evolution. Tyrogue is very energetic; it puts this energy into training. It constantly challenges, or randomly attacks, different Pokémon in order to get stronger, though it often ends up with injuries caused by much stronger Pokémon. Even if it loses, it will never give up on its training. If a captive Tyrogue doesn`t have various set training methods established by its trainer, it will often become stressed. Tyrogue and its evolutions are based as all male.</description>

<description>Hitmontop has a sharp point on the top of its head which allows it to balance itself upside-down on its head, the position which it holds in much of the time while it is observed. While it can walk upright, it often travels by spinning like a top, letting it travel much faster. Using the centrifugal force to boost its attack by ten times, it launches elegant kicks while spinning. This allows it to throw off its opponent`s timing, and give it a good mix of offense and defense. If it spins fast enough, it can dig into the ground. Any punch or hand based moves breed into or learned by a Tyrogue will carry into either of its evolved forms. This means that even a Hitmontop can know a move like Mach Punch or High Jump Kick.</description>

<description>Raikou is one of the three "Legendary Beasts" that are featured in Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal. According to legend, the Legendary Beasts were reincarnated by Ho-Oh from the spirits of three Pokémon which died in the fire that gave Burnt Tower its name. They are awakened in this tower in their first appearance. Another myth maintains that Raikou descended to earth together with a lightning bolt. Each Beast personifies a force of nature - Raikou, in particular, embodies the speed of lightning.
Like many Electric-type Pokémon, Raikou stores tremendous energy inside its body. This grants it extraordinary vitality, allowing it to run continuously across the land while shooting off electricity from the rain cloud that is on its back. Raikou`s roar is aptly described as "thunderous": it is loud enough to create shock waves and shake the ground as if actual thunder had struck.
Raikou is featured in a special anime episode called Raikou - The Legend of Thunder that forms the first three episodes of Pokémon Chronicles. In the special, two Team Rocket agents named Attila and Hun scheme to capture Raikou with a device that reflects and deflects energy blasts. Three New Bark Town trainers risk their own lives to try and save Raikou. It is thought by the trainers that Raikou attempts to guard other electric Pokémon from danger whenever possible.</description>

They are awakened in this tower in their first video game appearance. Other myths maintains that it is born during the eruption of a volcano, and that a new one is born along with each volcano.
Entei is an embodiment of magma, being able to launch powerfully searing, fire that is hotter than magma from its mouth. This fire consumes everything that it touches. When it roars, volcanos around it are apparently triggered to erupt. Due to being unable to fully control its own power, it constantly sprints around the world.
Entei is the main Pokémon in the movie Pokémon the Movie 3: Spell of the Unown, in which the Unown create it from Molly`s imagination.</description>

According to legend, the Legendary Beasts were reincarnated by Ho-Oh from the spirits of three Pokémon which died in the fire that gave Burnt Tower its name. They are awakened in this tower in their first video game appearance. It is the incarnation of northern winds, which always blow as it passes throughout the world. It also embodies the compassion of a spring, so as it travels, it seeks out pure reservoirs of water, and using its power, it instantly purifies dirty, muddy, or otherwise polluted water into the clearest of liquids by simply stepping into it.
In Pokémon Crystal Suicune is the star Pokémon, in a similar way that Pokémon Gold showcased Ho-oh or Pokémon Silver showcased Lugia. Eusine, a mysterious trainer, appears throughout the course of the game. He is set on meeting and catching Suicune, and will battle the player for that honor. Eventually, Suicune can be caught by heading to the Tin Tower after obtaining the Clear Bell. Three old men will challenge the player to a battle and if they are defeated, they will allow access to a floor where Suicune waits to battle.
Suicune makes various appearances in the anime, mainly appearing before Ash and his friends. It is featured in various episodes, and it plays a role in the movie, Pokémon 4Ever.</description>

After it has eaten a large mountain or a comparable amount of dirt, it falls into a deep sleep and begins the evolutionary process to evolve into its pupa stage, Pupitar
In Pokémon: Master Quest, Ash Ketchum, en route to New Bark Town after winning all eight Johto League badges, is asked to deliver a Pokémon egg to Professor Elm. However, on the way, the egg hatches, and Larvitar was born. Soon afterwards, Professor Elm asks Ash and company to return Larvitar to its home in Mt. Silver. It doesn`t open up to anyone except Ash and Pikachu, who nurse it from sickness. This is due to its abduction by a gang of Pokémon poachers as well as the physical harm they caused to its mother, Tyranitar. It eventually opens up to others, and is returned to its mother on Mt. Silver.</description>

<description>Lugia is a legendary Pokémon that first appears in Pokémon Gold and Silver, appearing on the boxart for Silver. Lugia, thought to be the guardian of the sea, resides deep in the ocean floor. It spends most of its time at the bottom of the sea due to its tremendous power, which includes being able to topple houses just by flapping its large, powerful wings and the ability to start storms that can last for over forty days. It is usually seen near the beginning of storms, and it often uses its wings to calm them.
It plays the role of a general legendary Pokémon in some games, where it waits in a far-off location, ready to battle. Lugia is one of the main characters of Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness. The storyline of the game depicts a "Shadow" Lugia terrorizing the locals and wreaking havoc. It is the only Shadow Pokémon whose physical appearance is different from its regular state. Shadow Lugia is said to be struggling, asking for help to free it from doing Cipher`s work in which "its deeper closed heart refuses to do". The player has to catch and Purify it for it to return to its original state.
In Pokémon: The Movie 2000, Lugia comes from the sea when the three Legendary Birds Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres are roused by a Pokémon collector who tries to catch the trio. Lugia then battles the raging Birds and, with the help of Ash and Team Rocket, manages to calm them and restore peace to nature. Lugia makes a second appearance in the Pokémon TV series when the protagonist, Ash, travels to the Whirl Islands where he meets his friend Richie to help stop a Team Rocket scientist from separating a young Lugia named "Silver" from her parent.</description>

<description>Ho-Oh is a legendary Pokémon that first appears in Pokémon Gold and Silver, appearing on Gold`s boxart. Long ago in Ecruteak City, there were two towers, the Brass Tower and Tin Tower being the roost of Lugia and Ho-Oh, respectively. When the Brass Tower burned down, both Pokémon fled, never to be seen again. Three Pokémon became trapped in the flames of the Brass Tower and perished. Ho-Oh returned to the Burned Tower and resurrected the three Pokémon, who were renamed Raikou, Entei, and Suicune. It has an unknown gender. On Gold, it is Lv40 when caught while it is Lv70 when caught in Silver. It is better to have the lower version as the move tutor does not exist in Gold/Silver.
It is called the Rainbow Pokémon due to its various associations with rainbows. Its feathers constantly change through the rainbow`s spectrum of colors as light hits them from different angles. These leave a rainbow trail as it flies continuously through the world`s skies, though it is said to live at the foot of a rainbow. It is said to appear before pure-hearted trainers as the representative of the bonds between humans and Pokémon, and bring happiness to all that see it. This is expanded upon in the anime, where it is said to appear before a hero. Ash Ketchum sees Ho-Oh various times throughout his journey, the first time being before Gold and Silver were even announced. It remained a mystery until it was revealed in Pokémon Gold.</description>

<description>Celebi is a time traveling legendary Pokémon that first debuted in Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Silver. It is the known as the guardian of the forest, where it is worshiped as a god. It wanders through time, visiting various undisturbed old-growth forests during peaceful times, leaving behind flourishing grass and trees. It often leaves behind an egg that it brought from the future. Celebi`s continuing existence signifies a good future.
Celebi cannot be captured in any English version of the Pokémon video games; however, it can be obtained at Nintendo promotional giveaway events. In Pokémon Colosseum, the power of Celebi is used to purify Shadow Pokémon. When one of the three Time Flutes in the game is used, Celebi will appear and purify a Shadow Pokémon instantly. Once all 48 Shadow Pokémon have been purified trainers playing the Japanese version of the game can obtain Celebi via the bonus disc that comes with Colosseum. On the North-American version, Celebi is replaced by Jirachi.
Despite being a legendary Pokémon, Celebi has fairly low stats, and its Psychic/Grass type cross means that 7 different types are "Super effective" against it, including a 4x weakness to Bug-types.
In the anime, Celebi is represented as a generally weak Pokémon that constantly needs protection. Celebi is one of the main characters in the movie Pokémon 4Ever. In this movie, Celebi is running away from a hunter. It crashes into young Samuel Oak who protects it, and in return, Celebi transports them forty years into the future, where Sam teams up with Ash Ketchum to save Celebi from a Team Rocket member who turns it into a Dark Celebi by capturing it in a Dark Poké Ball. Near the end of the movie, several dozen Celebi appear from all sorts of different eras in time to help out. It also makes appearances in various episodes.
In Pokemon Mystery Dungeon 2, a shiny Celebi helps a Grovyle and the Main protagonist return to their world from the future. After this, she vanishes because the future she was a part of ceased to exist due to the character stopping Primal Dialga.</description>

<description>Grovyle is the evolution of Treecko. The leaves that grow out of Grovyle`s body, as well as its matching green coloration, provide excellent camouflage against the background of its native habitats, the forests and jungles. But even if spotted, Grovyle has little trouble escaping danger. Its powerful thigh muscles make it very adept at climbing trees and jumping from branch to branch very quickly, disappearing into the forest and eluding its pursuers.
In the anime, Ash Ketchum`s Treecko evolves into Grovyle. Its personality does not change much; Grovyle is as much of a loner as Treecko was, and it loves the challenge of a battle. It also habitually keeps a twig in its mouth, although larger than the one it used to keep as a Treecko. When Ash returns to Kanto to take the Battle Frontier challenge, Grovyle is one of the Pokémon he takes with him. Ash continues to use Grovyle until its evolution into Sceptile.</description>

<description>Sceptile is the final evolution of Treecko. Sceptile`s power is unmatched in the jungle, and they are thus the dominant species in such environments. Sceptile`s bodies are configured for battling prowess and superior mobility in jungle environments, with large, sharp leaves protruding from their arms and legs that can easily cut large trees. As caretakers of the forest, these Pokémon carefully grow trees and plants with loving care. The orb-like seeds on a Sceptile`s back are filled to the brim with nutrients, which Sceptile use to revitalize the trees in their care. Sceptile regulate their body temperature by basking in sunlight.
In the anime Battle Frontier saga, Ash`s Grovyle evolves into a Sceptile during a battle with a Tropius. Even after evolution, Sceptile retains its rebellious personality. Ash`s Sceptile is initially unable to use any attacks, due to the psychological impact of a Meganium`s rejection. However, it regains the ability to use its attacks, and it later learns the SolarBeam attack.</description>

Before Torchic`s legs develop fully, it stays with their Pokémon trainer, following behind with unsteady, hopping steps while it learns to walk properly. It attacks by spitting 1,800 degree fire formed in a special pouch in its stomach. This pouch constantly heats its body, allowing it to give "warm hugs." It dislikes darkness due to not being able to see its surroundings.
In the anime, May choses a playful Torchic as her starter Pokémon because she considers it to be cute. She often uses it in battles, but avoids using it in Pokémon Contests until it evolves.</description>

<description>Mightyena is the larger and stronger evolved form of Poochyena. It is a carnivore with characteristics of hyenas and wolves, and a monochrome appearance. Mightyena inhabit wide grasslands in the Pokemon world. They live and hunt in packs, and never defy the orders of their leader, the alpha male of the pack; thanks to the leader`s experience in battle tactics, the pack defeats foes with perfectly coordinated teamwork. This unquestioning loyalty transfers over to when Mightyena are owned by Pokemon trainers, but the Mightyena will only obey the orders of a trainer it recognizes as possessing superior skill.
Mightyena are naturally quick to attack; they chase down their prey and nip until the target can no longer run. In the event that an individual Mightyena encounters a threatening foe, it gives obvious signals when it is preparing to attack; It starts to growl deeply and then flattens its body before biting savagely.</description>

<description>Zigzagoon is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation III.
It evolves into Linoone starting at level 20.
In Galar, Zigzagoon has a Dark/Normal-type regional form. It evolves into Galarian Linoone starting at level 20, which evolves into Obstagoon when leveled up at night starting at level 35.
Zigzagoon is a raccoon-like, quadruped Pokémon with bristly, zigzag-patterned fur. It has stripes formed by alternating layers of cream and brown fur. It has a brown head with spiky ears and a black nose. A black, mask pattern surrounds its brown eyes. The upper half of its mouth is jagged, and when it is open, there are two pointed teeth in its lower jaw. Its feet have three claws and pink paw pads. Its forefeet are cream-colored, but the hind feet are brown. Its brush tail is spiky and bristly.
In Galar, the oldest and original form of Zigzagoon have a more black and white patterned-fur. The red eyes are surrounded by a black spiked mask. The black feet contains three sharp white claws. It has a long pink tongue that is constantly standing outside of mouth with two lower teeth in between.
Zigzagoon is abundantly curious, as it wanders restlessly back and forth while rubbing its nose to the ground in search of something. It rubs its bristly back hair against trees to mark its territory, and plays dead to fool opponents in battle. Zigzagoon is found commonly in grassy fields. The Zigzagoon in Galar are known to be constantly on the move and never settling down. It is believed that the zigzag movements of the Zigzagoon from other regions originated from its Galar relatives. They enjoy battling to the point they often attempt to prove others into fighting it. While this succeeded with other Pokémon, humans instead mistaken it wanting affection, much to the Zigzagoon`s frustrations.</description>

<description>Linoone is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation III.
It evolves from Zigzagoon starting at level 20.
In Galar, Linoone has a Dark/Normal-type regional form. It evolves from Galarian Zigzagoon starting at level 20 and evolves into Obstagoon when leveled up at night starting at level 35.
Linoone is a slender-bodied, quadruped Pokémon. Most of its fur is white, but it has several brown stripes. One long stripe stretches the length of its body before ending in an arrowhead shape on its forehead. The are additional stripes on each side of its bushy tail and on its cheeks. It has sharp, elongated claws and small pointed teeth. It has small, tuft-like ears, long cheek fur, and blue eyes.
Linoone can run up to 60 miles per hour, but has to stop before it can make a turn. It often fails to catch prey due to only being able to run in a straight line. When it sees prey underwater in ponds, it leaps in and uses its sharp claws to catch the prey. As shown in the anime, Linoone has an attraction to anything round, and will grab any orb-shaped object it sees if given the chance. It often carries a snatched object in its expandable cheek pouches and deposits it in any of a number of secret stashes it keep on its territory. Linoone tends to live in grasslands.
In Galar, Linoone has a black and white color scheme due to harsh environment in the region among with competition. This allows its survival instinct to improve, leading to the ability to evolve into Obstagoon. Its eyes are red while covered with a stripe shaped like a shooting star. It has longer claws with grey fur surrounding the front feet. It also has sharp teeth on the upper mouth with a long red tongue sticking out.
Galarian Linoone are know to be rash and fearless. It prefers recklessly challenging opponents that are stronger than itself. Linoone is known to use its long tongue to taunt opponents. Once the foe is fully enraged, Linoone will hurl itself at the opponent, tackling them by force. These traits make Galarian Linoone very popular among unhappy and angry youths in Galar, who have nowhere to take out their anger and frustrations on. By charging at up to 60 miles per hour, it can deliver powerful Tackles and Headbutts with enough destructive force to even knock away a car. Linoone can be thrown off balance should it miss, however.</description>

<description>Wurmple is a larval Pokémon common in both the Hoenn region and the Sinnoh region. It can be considered the modern counterpart to earlier larval Pokémon species Caterpie and Weedle. A common target for avian Pokémon such as Swellow and Staravia, the generally weak Wurmple attempts to defend itself with the spikes on its tail and head which secrete poison, and it can spit slimy thread to slow down opponents. Otherwise, Wurmple feeds by peeling the bark off trees and feeds on the oozing sap. Its feet are tipped with suction pads that allow it to cling to glass without slipping. Wurmple can evolve into either Cascoon or Silcoon (Silcoon---Beautifly and Cascoon---Dustox) depending on what kind of trainer is training it.
In the Pokémon anime, recurring female trainers May and Jessie each catch a Wurmple, and their rivalry is reflected in the differing forms the Wurmple evolve into; May`s Wurmple becomes a Silcoon that eventually evolves into a Beautifly, while Jessie`s Wurmple becomes a Cascoon that eventually evolves into a Dustox.</description>

<description>Beautifly is a butterfly Pokémon and one of two flying insect Pokémon forms that Wurmple can eventually take. It can be considered a modern counterpart to the earlier butterfly Pokémon species Butterfree, but it is definitely the physical counterpart to Dustox, the other form into which a Wurmple can eventually evolve. Beautifly is a very vain and colorful butterfly with a long, coiled, needle-like mouth not unlike the proboscis of a real butterfly, which it uses both for gathering pollen in the wild and, despite their gentle appearance, for aggressively attacking opponent Pokémon when angered. It is most active in the springtime, where it rides the spring winds as it flits around gathering pollen from flower-covered fields, or from potted flowers left on windowsills.
In the Pokémon anime, Beautifly becomes May`s primary Pokémon for use in Pokémon contests early on, and Jessie`s Dustox is established as its rival.</description>

<description>Dustox is a moth-like Pokémon and one of two flying insect Pokémon forms that Wurmple can eventually evolve into, the other being Beautifly. Dustox`s green wings are coated with a fine and powerfully toxic dust which it uses to defend itself and deter bird Pokémon that might attack it. It feeds on leaves on trees it seeks out with its radar-like antennae, and it is instinctively attracted to bright light like many real moths. Swarms of Dustox can end up attracted to the bright lights of major cities at night, and end up causing unintentional havoc with the trees of those cities.
In the Pokémon anime, Dustox becomes Jesse`s primary Pokémon for use in Pokémon contests early on, and is often treated as a rival to May`s Beautifly. Jessie often tries to cheat with her Dustox, however, they still seem to always lose to May`s Beautifly. Jessie later releases Dustox so it could be with its mate.</description>

<description>Lotad is both an aquatic and a land-dwelling Pokémon, found in the Hoenn region, with a lilypad growing on its back. This species lives in groups at ponds, with their bodies submerged while suspended at the surface by their buoyant leaves, as a measure of hiding from predators. When on dry land, Lotad scuttles towards other ponds because its leaf is too heavy to support, in contrast to Lotad`s ancient ancestors which were one primarily land-dwelling Pokémon. Lotad and its evolved forms have mouths resembling duck bills, which may be a pun on the duckweed.
In the Pokémon anime, a Lotad becomes one of the Pokémon in trainer Brock`s possession in the third-generation Hoenn story arc in a development considered ironic because previously Brock primarily used Pokémon of the Rock and Ground types. His Lotad eventually evolved into Lombre, and then Ludicolo.</description>

Lombre`s entire body is covered by a slippery, slimy film. It feels horribly unpleasant to be touched by this Pokémon`s hands. It feeds on aquatic moss that grows in the riverbed. It is also a mischief-maker: When a Lombre spots anglers, it will tug on their fishing lines from beneath the surface and enjoy their consternation. It also takes great delight in popping out of rivers and startling people.
In the Pokémon anime, the Lotad in trainer Brock`s possession during the third-generation Hoenn story arc evolves into a Lombre over time, and later on into a Ludicolo. As a Lombre, Brock`s is quirky and dense.</description>

Ludicolo can derive much energy and vitality from cheerful and upbeat music. Upon hearing such music, for example during festivities or mountain hiking expeditions, Ludicolo is driven into the open and starts dancing rhythmically. The principle behind this phenomenon is that the melodious sound waves are supposed to stimulate Ludicolo`s cells into making it more powerful.
In the Pokémon anime, the Lombre in trainer Brock`s possession during the third-generation Hoenn story arc evolves into a Ludicolo. Like many of the Ludicolo species, Brock`s Ludicolo is very cheerful and is frequently seen dancing joyfully around.</description>

<description>Seedot is an acorn-like Pokémon found in the Hoenn region. It feeds by using the top of its head to attach itself to a tree branch and then proceed to suck moisture and nutrients from it. In this state, when still, it is seemingly impossible to distinguish it from a real acorn. It apparently appreciates this fact because it enjoys startling Pidgey foraging in the area by suddenly moving. When Seedot finishes feeding, its body becomes heavy enough that it drops to the ground with a clear thump.</description>

<description>Nuzleaf is the larger evolved form of Seedot. Nuzleaf is a forest-dwelling Pokémon that is skilled at climbing trees, though they occasionally venture out of the forest to startle people. They live in holes bored in large trees. Its long and pointed nose is its weak point, and it loses power if the nose is gripped. For this reason, it dislikes having its long nose pinched. Nuzleaf will sometimes pull out the leaf on its head and make a flute with it. The sound of Nuzleaf`s flute strikes fear and uncertainty in the hearts of people lost in a forest. This is a reference to Pan, the Greek god of the forest.</description>

Shiftry`s appearance is based on the Tengu of Japanese mythology, with a long nose, white hair, feet resembling Geta sandals, and large fan-like hands being elements based on how Tengu are commonly portrayed. It is a mysterious entity in the Pokémon world said to arrive by the chilly winds of Winter, and it is said to be a fearsome guardian of the deep forests it holds sway over from its homes on the tops of toweringly tall trees in dark forests. Its hand fans, which are larger on males than on females, are capable of whipping 100-mph gusts of wind, and it possesses a degree of Extra-sensory perception, able to read its foe`s mind and take preemptive actions most other Pokemon would be unable to do in time. Nuzleaf is a generally strong pokemon but doesnt learn any "good" attacks until it reaches a generally high level.</description>

<description>Taillow is a common bird Pokémon species found in the Hoenn region. Its Japanese name comes from tsubame (swallow). It is a migratory bird that dislikes cold seasons. It migrates to other lands in search of warmth, flying over 180 miles a day on some occasions. It will courageously stand their ground against foes, taking on Pokémon like Skarmory with an equal footing. This gutsy Pokémon will remain defiant even after a loss. This however is in stark contrast to when it becomes hungry; it cries loudly. As a result of its relative youth, it sometimes becomes lonely and cries at night. It feeds on Wurmple that live in forests.
In the Pokémon anime, main trainer Ash Ketchum caught one and used it throughout the third-generation story arc, during which it evolved into a Swellow.</description>

It lives as a migratory bird of prey; it constantly flies towards warmer climates in a migratory fashion, and the moment it spots its prey, Swellow dives down at a steep angle and snatches the hapless victim tightly with its talons. It never misses its targets in this respect. Swellow is quite fastidious with its own body, especially its wings. When it is not cleaning its wings and tail feathers regularly, two Swellow are gathered together and unhesitantly take it upon themselves to clean each other`s wings. A Swellow`s tail feathers indicate that the individual is healthy if the feathers are standing at attention. Though it`s name suggests it`s based on a swallow, Swellow has many characteristics of a falcon
In the Pokemon anime, main trainer Ash Ketchum owned a Swellow, and he used it prominently throughout his journey in Hoenn.</description>

This uniquely proportioned pelican is usually found by or over oceans or other large bodies of water. It builds its nest on high cliffs facing the sea, and is able to rest on top of waves to regain energy. Pelipper skims the tops of waves while it hunts for its prey, which are typically fish Pokémon. When Pelipper spots its prey, it dips its large beak into the water and scoops it up. It then proceeds to swallow it whole. Pelipper also carries the eggs of its Wingull offspring inside its beak before and after they hatch. This provides the offspring with protection and, after they hatch, nourishment from the hunted food.</description>

When Kirlia uses its power, the air around it becomes distorted, creating mirages of nonexistent scenery. Kirlia`s appearance and mood are heavily determined by the mood of its trainer. If the trainer is cheerful and happy, Kirlia will also be happy, and will spin and dance. The happier the trainer is, the more beautiful Kirlia will become. Likewise, a heartless trainer will result in a weak and saddened Kirlia, and its powers will have decreased significantly.</description>

<description>Surskit is a bug-like species of Pokémon based on the water strider insect. It was introduced in the third generation of Pokémon media in the fictional Hoenn region. Surskit frequents lakes and ponds, and it has the ability to walk, or at least glide, on the water`s surface thanks to an oily substance secreted from the tips of its feet which modifies the water`s surface tension, thus allowing the water to support its weight. Surskit`s diet consists of the microscopic organisms that are found at the base of a lake ecosystem`s food chain. Surskit can also secrete a thick, sweet syrup resembling honey from the tip of its head. This sap is said to appeal to some species of Pokémon such as Heracross. Surskit usually secretes the syrup when it finds itself in danger. The exact reasoning behind this is unclear, but it may aim at attracting Pokémon which will drive the danger away to lick the syrup off Surskit`s head.</description>

This serves as an intimidation tactic to ward off potential predators. The four parallelogram-shaped appendages on its bottom are its real wings, and their fast flapping motions give Masquerain the ability to fly forwards, sideways, and backwards like a helicopter. Masquerain can`t fly in rain, so it therefore shelters itself under large trees and leaves.</description>

Slakoth is one of the most proficient sleepers in the Pokémon world, sleeping 20 hours a day (compare with Abra), and it is clearly not worried about possible predators in the area. Onlookers get sleepy themselves when looking at a Slakoth, in fact.

<description>Nincada is an insectoid species of Pokémon found in the Hoenn region. It burrows underground and lives for years by feeding on tree roots, hiding motionlessly under the soil. Using its whiskerlike antennae, it feels its way to tree roots, which it slices open with its claws to feed. As a burrower, it`s nearly blind until it evolves, and it doesn`t even like being exposed to light.
Much like the cicada, it metamorphoses into a flying adult form through Pokémon evolution called Ninjask, and it leaves a distinctive husk behind. Unlike the mundane cicada`s husk, however, Nincada`s husk itself becomes a separate, sentient Pokémon species known as Shedinja. This is the only instance in Pokémon media where an individual Pokémon`s evolutionary process results in the creation of two individual Pokémon, and in the Pokémon RPGs when a Pokémon trainer-owned Nincada evolves into a Ninjask, a Shedinja will appear in an empty slot in the trainer`s Pokémon inventory.</description>

It constantly darts around, moving so fast that it is difficult to detect it. However, its distinctive cry is all too well heard, which led people in the Pokémon world to consider Ninjask invisible in the past. Ninjask loves to feed on tree sap. Ninjask is a difficult Pokémon to train, not only because it is hard to keep track of its location but also due to its demanding personality. Ninjask needs a competent trainer, and if it finds itself in the hands of an inexperienced person it will refuse to obey and instead cry continuously.</description>

<description>Whismur is a basic species of Pokémon found in the Hoenn region. Whismur is a very timid Pokémon who dwells in caves. Its most defining characteristic is its voice. Normally, a Whismur makes very little noise, murmuring at a barely audible volume. However, if it senses danger, a Whismur starts crying in an incredibly loud voice that rivals the noise made by a jet plane. Whismur will then be startled by their own crying and cry harder, until they tire themselves out and fall asleep. Once Whismur starts crying, it will probably go on for some time even if the danger goes away, because it is startled by its own crying and cries louder still. It doesn`t even pause to catch its breath, since it breathes in through its ear canals (a technique reminiscent of circular breathing). Therefore, if its ear covers are shut, Whismur will stop crying. Otherwise, it will continue until it cries itself to sleep.</description>

Loudred`s bellowing can decimate a wood-frame house and its subsequent shockwaves can turn over a truck. It only needs to use its voice to punish its foes. Its round ears serve as loudspeakers, and they are positioned to assail foes with ultrasonic waves at massive volume. Loudred are also immune to Jigglypuff`s and Wigglytuff`s song.</description>

<description>Exploud is the final evolved form of the Whismur evolutionary line. This large, imposing purple creature has a body and vocal cords that are specifically constructed to emit noises and sounds of any decibel level, high or low. The holes seen all over its body actually serve a dual-purpose; They can violently inhale air, signifying that Exploud is about to let loose a huge bellow loud enough that it can be heard from over six miles away and strong enough to trigger earthquakes. Exploud employs this as its offensive measure against opponents in battle. The holes themselves can emit sounds as well. The sound-generating organs hidden at the base of each tubular hole can be adjusted by Exploud for tone and volume, and whenever Exploud lets loose a bellow, the noise is amplified by these organs. When communicating with other Pokémon such as other Exploud, it emits slighter whistle-like sounds from its sound tubes instead of its normal voice.</description>

It is thought that Makuhita regularly train in the secluded environs of a cave, and people around these caves have often reported hearing rumbling tremors from within the caves. Its body training is noted to always be accompanied by ample food consumption and sleep, for it is the goal of a Makuhita to gain enough weight and body mass to evolve into its bigger, fatter form of Hariyama.</description>

Although it appears fat, its bulk is made up almost entirely of muscle. If Hariyama were to tighten these muscles, it would be as hard as a rock. It has been known to challenge people to contests of strength without any hesitation. It has even been observed to stand on train tracks and stop trains in their tracks using forearm thrusts as a display of its power.</description>

<description>Azurill, a species of Pokémon introduced shortly before the official start of the third generation of the Pokémon franchise as a "preview Pokémon", is the younger pre-evolved form of the Marill species introduced in the second generation. Its circular tail is large and rubbery, and Azurill`s playful nature causes it to often be seen bouncing and playing on its bouncy tail. The tail is vital both for survival in peacetime and self-defense in battle; It is packed full with nutrients that supply itself to Azurill`s body in order for it to grow. It is also a floatation device in water, much like the tails of its evolutions Marill and Azumarill. Its tail is about 1.3x as large as its body. Azurill`s most intriguing habit with its tail involves spinning its tail as if it were a lasso, then hurling it out with intense force. The momentum of the throw sends its body flying, too. Using this unique mode of travel, one individual Azurill was seen to hurl itself a record 33 feet.
In the Pokémon RPGs, Azurill can only be acquired by hatching an egg produced by Marill holding the Sea Incense item. In the Pokémon anime, trainer Misty owns one after her previous "baby" Pokémon, Togepi, evolved into Togetic and departed. This Azurill is the offspring of Tracey`s Marill. It is shown to have a sweet and caring nature and loves to play with the other Pokémon.</description>

<description>Nosepass is a Pokemon species found in the Hoenn region. Nosepass appears as a rocky-but-animate figurine vaguely in the shape of an Easter Island statue. It lives in caves and comes across as immobile because it is often found standing still in these environments. However, Nosepass displays behavior commonly associated with predatorial animals in the wild as well, hunting and feeding on prey that might be foolish enough to approach it. Its full body emits a powerful force of magnetism which it uses to pull its prey towards it like a tractor beam before feeding. This sense of magnetism is naturally bolstered in cold seasons.
The nose of Nosepass is undoubtedly its most notable feature. It is the focal point of Nosepass` magnetic nature, and this works to make Nosepass something of a living compass. When seen standing idly, it is consistently facing the North Pole as directed by its magnetic nose. Travelers who encounter this Pokemon can therefore actually use the placement of a Nosepass to check the direction of north and get their bearings. However, close observation has revealed that the Pokemon is affected by polar drift; With each passing year, Nosepass` direction shifts slightly at a rate of 3/8 of an inch each year. Since all Nosepass have noses of the same magnetism, if two of these Pokemon meet, they cannot turn their faces towards each other when they are close because their magnetic noses repel one another.
In the fourth generation of Pokemon media, if a Nosepass is brought to the Sinnoh region and it gains a level of experience while inside Mt. Coronet, it will evolve into Probopass.</description>

This even includes steel bridges and rails, something which occasionally causes problems for humans. Because of this, Aron colonies are largely considered a pest to society.

In a demo of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl played at PokéJungle, a new Pokémon made its appearance, the evolved form of Roselia named Roserade, as Ken Sugimori had announced at the Pokémon Garden site; Ken Sugimori later stated the possibility of a pre-evolved form of Roselia as well, which was revealed to be Budew.</description>

<description>Wailord is a gigantic, oceanic mammal with the largest known size of all Pokémon. Living in the vast oceans of the Pokémon world, Wailord swims languorously in pods of about four members or more, often at the surface so it can breathe through its upper nostrils. With huge mouths these Pokémon can eat massive amounts of undersea food, such as krill, in a single gulp. When chasing somewhat larger prey, Wailord herd them by leaping out of the water and making humongous splashes in what is often described as a breathtaking display. If a Wailord inhales to the maximum capacity of its gigantic lungs, it is able to dive close to 10,000 feet below the surface. Optionally by puffing itself up, it can float high on the ocean surface or beach on a shoreline if it wishes.</description>

<description>Torkoal exhales an always present cloud of smoke through its nostrils and through holes in its body and has a dark gray stone shell. It also consumes coal. Torkoal fills the hollows in its shell with coal and burns it - its strength is diminished without this supply. It will search through whole mountains to find it. If attacked, this Pokemon spouts thick black smoke in order to retreat. If this is not possible, this Pokémon needs more coal for energy. It lets off a sound that is similar to a locomotive`s horn when emitting smoke from its nostrils.
In the anime, Ash and friends help protect a Torkoal from the guardian of the place which consists of a Steelix. After saving it, Ash captures it. His Torkoal displays a large amount of affection for him and usually starts crying at random moments since it has low self esteem and usually does everything wrong, like diving into the ocean. Upon his return to Kanto to participate in the Battle Frontier, Ash left Torkoal and Glalie with Professor Oak.</description>

<description>Spoink leads a bizarre, fragile existence. It moves around by bouncing on its tail. However, Spoink`s bouncing has an additional, far more vital role. The small shock generated by Spoink`s impact with the ground every time it bounces courses through its body and causes its heart to pump. Essentially, Spoink`s heart is jumpstarted every time it beats. If Spoink ever stopped bouncing, its heart would stop and it would die. Thus, Spoink constantly bounces up and down, even while sleeping.
Spoink exhibits its psychic powers best by focusing them through an object, which also serves to amplify them. This object is the pearl that a Clamperl makes once in its lifetime. The pearl size is also the amount of power the Spoink has. That is why it`s always looking for bigger pearls, it wants more power! The anime suggests that prolonged separation of Spoink from its pearl will weaken Spoink greatly, even risking death.
Spoink resembles a pig.</description>

The characteristic a Zangoose is most famous for is its relationship with Seviper. Simply put, the two species are mortal enemies.

Lunatone was first discovered forty years ago in Meteor Falls, a cave in Hoenn, its only known habitat. Meteor Falls, as its name suggests, is full of meteorites and the craters left by them as they impacted the planet`s surface, suggesting that Lunatone (and Solrock) as partners, have their origins in outer space. Lunatone is greatly connected to the moon, and its vitality ebbs and flows depending on the lunar cycle. Lunatone`s power and activity is greatest during the full moon, and weakest during the day and when the moon is new. Anyone who looks at its glowing red eyes becomes transfixed with fear.</description>

Solrock, apparently a meteorite whose origins appear to be from outer space, is expressionless, yet is somewhat sentient. It was discovered along with Lunatone in Meteor Falls, a site where a rain of meteorites impacted the ground. The Pokemon`s solar connections are apparent in battle: It absorbs solar power during the day and unleashes the sunlight as a concentrated beam of energy as its main weapon (compare with Venusaur). Since it also carries Psychic powers, Solrock can also sense what the foe is thinking. Solrock and Lunatone are counterparts. Lunatone represents the moon and Solrock represents the sun.</description>

<description>Barboach lives in muddy areas of riverbeds. It probes this mud with its whiskers before deciding where to bury itself underneath the level of the mud, so that it remains motionless while its top whiskers are poking above the surface. The whiskers act as a superb radar system in this position, for Barboach detects its prey in the area using its whiskers to sense disturbances in the air.
Barboach`s body is covered with a slimy film, which is an important measure of discouraging both bacteria and predators from targeting Barboach. Whenever Barboach is partially submerged in mud, the film functions as a barrier to prevent germs in the mud from entering Barboach`s otherwise thin, unprotected body. Also, if a predator attempts to grab it, the Pokemon effortlessly slips out of its grasp as if it were a bar of wet, flexible soap like the real world Hagfish. It would seem that Barboach`s body depends on keeping its slimy coating layer thick and fluid with the influence of muddy water because the Pokemon`s body weakens if the coating dries up.</description>

<description>Whiscash is a whale-like Pokémon. It has a dark-blue body, large round eyes, and thick light-blue lips, which usually form a smile. Attached on both cheeks are two long, yellow whiskers, which is why the Pokédex describes them as "Whiskers Pokémon". In its shiny version, Whiscash` belly and whiskers have turned dark red, and its body black.
Despite its amusing appearance, Whiscash is an extremely violent and territorial Pokémon. It makes its nest at the bottom of ponds or swamps, where it sleeps throughout the day. At night, it awakes, after which it will eat continually. Whiscash will easily claim a large pond or swamp as its exclusive territory. If an intruder approaches it, Whiscash will thrash about, triggering massive earthquakes with a radius of over three miles. Whiscash also has the ability to predict real earthquakes.
Whishcash, Namazun in the Japanese games, is clearly based upon the Namazu ("catfish") in Japanese mythology. The creature lives in the mud beneath the earth, and is guarded by the god Kashima, who restrains the creature with a stone. If Kashima lets his guard fall however, Namazu will be set loose and cause earthquakes.
Whiscash has a mark similar to a "W" on its head. Since its Japanese name does not contain a "W", many believe it stands for "Widiot", which matches its vacant expression.</description>

<description>Corphish is not indigenous to the Hoenn region, but to a landmass overseas. It was introduced to Hoenn as an exotic pet, but the species ended up familiarising itself so much that it now forms part of the local ecosystem. It`s unknown where it is native from. Corphish is a hardy and durable Pokémon; it can thrive almost under any condition. It can make its nest even in polluted water, and it will make a meal out of anything available, taking the term omnivore to extremes.
In the Pokémon anime, Corphish is one of the Pokémon that Ash has in his traveling team for the duration of Hoenn and the entire Battle Frontier challenge in Kanto. Corphish is friendly, but does not realize its own strength; it often ends up flinging Ash away while expressing its affection to him. Corphish is also short-tempered, and often tries to instigate a fight when peaceful solutions exist, and also gets jealous when one of Ash`s Pokémon evolve, since it wants Ash`s attention.</description>

Crawdaunt sheds its shell regularly; this leaves the exposed body vulnerable to attacks while the new shell is soft.

In a particularly turbulent area of the sea shore, Cradily anchors itself to the sea floor with its heavy, particularly shaped lower body so as to prevent itself from being washed out to sea.
When hunting marine creatures, Cradily makes its way deeper into the ocean, dragging its heavy body along as its body`s anchor-like composition prevents Cradily from floating off the sea floor and to the surface. When Cradily spots its prey, it extends its trunk-like neck and its eight tentacles to ensnare its target, where it uses powerful acid secreted in its tentacles to melt the prey before feeding.</description>

Finally, a Kecleon will revert to its original colors if it is startled.

A Chimecho can produce seven different tones to communicate various messages to its kindred. If threatened, Chimecho can use its cries as a defensive weapon, turning them into ultrasonic waves that knock its foes back.
Although Chimecho did not officially exist at that time, a figure of it appears in the TV episode "The Ghost of Maiden`s Peak" on one of the small lantern ships (18:30-18:35 in the US version).</description>

<description>Absol is known as the "Disaster Pokémon" because it appears before natural disasters such as earthquakes and tidal waves. It lives in the rugged mountains, and only leaves to warn people of natural disasters with its innate ability to sense them through subtle changes in the sky and the land. People often accuse Absols of causing the disasters themselves, resulting in its reputation as a doom-bringer. It generally lives for up to one hundred years.
In Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red/Blue Rescue Team, an Absol makes a short appearance in Frosty Forest.</description>

<description>Wynaut is the pre-evolved form of Wobbuffet. Wynaut is always seen with a big, happy smile on its face, regardless of what its actual mood is. To determine its real mood Pokémon Trainers must look at a Wynaut`s tail. If it can be seen slapping its tail on the ground continuously, it can be presumed that it is in an angry temperament.</description>

<description>Snorunt live in icy dark caves and enjoys crying out to hear its own echo. Its diet consists solely of snow and ice. Old folklore claims that a house visited by Snorunt is sure to prosper for many generations to come. It generally moves in groups of five Snorunt, and they hide away during the hot seasons of Summer and Spring. Being an Ice-type, Snorunt can withstand temperatures of up to negative 150 degrees. Also, it has the peculiar ability to make Winter come early. A Snorunt typically evolves into a Glalie at level 42, but if a Snorunt is female and a player uses a Dawn Stone on it, it will evolve into a Froslass.
In the Pokémon anime, Snorunt is Ash Ketchum`s fifth Pokémon from the Hoenn region. It has a powerful Ice Beam, though this is hindered by Snorunt`s bad aim. Because of this, Ash constantly trains it to try and improve its use of the technique. Snorunt eventually evolves into Glalie while fighting Team Rocket.</description>

<description>Spheal is a spherical creature that rolls across ice floes because its body isn`t cut out for swimming. Spheal, in spite of its infancy, is fully capable of living in Arctic environments such as a tundra. Though it is not obvious, its body is fully covered in a layer of plushy fur that feels fluffy to the touch. This is surprisingly good at insulating Spheal against the cold when it is rolling about on ice floes or diving into the sea, for it apparently never feels the cold at all. When groups of Spheal eat, they instinctively show their pleasure by clapping and making other noises.</description>

<description>Sealeo lives in herds among the ice floes of Arctic regions, and these herds consist of both itself and its other evolutionary forms Spheal and Walrein. Its flippers are quite powerful: they are strong enough to shatter ice with well-placed flaps. Five times a day, Sealeo dives into the sea to hunt prey.
Sealeo`s behavior revolves mostly around its sensitive nose; Sealeo uses it to investigate new things. It lifts new objects up with its nose, and rolls them around. While rolling an object, Sealeo checks the object`s aroma and texture in order to learn about it. This is what it does to differentiate food from anything else, making it a vital ability for survival. However, Sealeo also takes a liking to balancing and spinning a younger Spheal on its nose for entertainment.</description>

The water pressure is high enough to be labeled crushing, but Huntail withstands it by having a body with a very thick and sturdy spine. Its eyes are suited for life far under the sea as well; they can see clearly even in the murky dark depths of the ocean. Huntail carries bioluminescence, which it uses when hunting prey. It lights up the eye-like textures on its tail and wiggles it to deceive prey into thinking they have found a fish to eat. Then Huntail attacks and attempts to swallow the prey whole with its gaping mouth. It prefers smaller prey since its body and stomach are rather thin.</description>

<description>Relicanth is a rare and inaccessible Pokémon, as it inhabits the deep ocean floor. Once thought to be extinct, it was discovered in an exploration mission of the sea abyss. Relicanth proved to be extremely well-adapted to its environment; so much so, that according to researchers in the Pokémon world, it has not changed form in 100,000,000 years. Relicanth`s body is covered in rock-like scales which are tough enough to withstand the enormous hydrostatic pressures exercised on it at such extreme depths, as is the case with other dwellers of the abyss. It uses its multiple pectoral fins as a means of locomotion across the sea bed. It is based on the real fish, the Coelacanth.</description>

<description>Metang is formed from two Beldum merging to form a Metang. This merge is more than a physical one; both Beldums` brains in a Metang are linked by a network of magnetic impulses, making Metang quite intelligent. The Beldum only manifest as the arms and eyes of the Metang; some other material must make up the head. With both Beldums` magnetic fields combined, Metang`s abilities manifest as telekinesis. Its telekinetic power allows it to hover a short distance above the ground, as well as fly at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour.
Metang doesn`t rely entirely on its magnetic telekinesis, however, as it already has a portion of the durability and strength of Metagross. Its metal carapace is tough enough to survive even cataclysmic explosions and can leave a collision from a jet plane without a scratch. Metang`s claws can rip through tempered steel.</description>

<description>Metagross is comprised by of two Metang forming together. Each leg is the body of a former Beldum, and its head/body is the four collective heads of Beldum used to fuse into it. Metagross`s intelligence is extraordinarily high: not only does it have four minds, but they are also connected by a highly complex neural network, which is nowadays a more accurate measure of the capacity for intelligence than the net amount of brain tissue. Its developed cerebral powers are said to surpass even those of a supercomputer. Metagross mostly relies on its massive strength. It can also use psychic abilities, including the ability to render its massive body airborne by telekinesis once it draws its legs together.
This Pokémon lives in mountainous areas. It can easily live comfortably on very steep slopes by planting its legs into rock or ground. Metagross is also a brutal predator. When hunting, it pins its prey to the ground under its massive body. It then eats the helpless victim using its large mouth on its underside.</description>

Being made completely out of rock, it has no brain or heart, which baffles the scientists of the Pokémon universe. Regirock along with its brothers Regice and Registeel often fill guardian roles; they are normally guarding their king, (Regigigas), but they also have been seen at The Tree of Beginning, and guarding (Mew). The various rocks that it is composed of come from different locations. If damaged in battle, it will repair itself with rocks it finds nearby.

<description>Groudon is one of a trio of legendary Pokémon, alongside Kyogre and Rayquaza, that represents Pokémon Ruby and appears on its cover art. In the legend surrounding the three, Groudon represents the land, while Kyogre and Rayquaza represent the sea and the sky, respectively. Groudon, representing land, raised lands and expanded continents in legend. Coming as a savior for humans suffering from floods caused by Kyogre, it can dissipate clouds, and evaporate water with light and heat. After a titanic battle with Kyogre, it went to sleep in underground magma, causing volcanoes to erupt when it awakes. It is a Ground-type with the Drought ability, which makes the weather sunny until another weather move is used or a Pokémon with another weather-altering ability is switched in.
Groudon first appears in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire and Pokémon Emerald along with Kyogre and Rayquaza. Pokémon Ruby focuses on Team Magma awakening Groudon to take over the world, while Pokémon Emerald has both Groudon and Kyogre awake. The anime follows a similar structure, where both Pokémon are awakened, and forced to battle by Team Magma and Team Aqua. This is foiled by Ash Ketchum and Lance, and Groudon and Kyogre return to their respective elements after calling a truce. Groudon also plays a pseudo-role in the sixth Pokémon movie, Jirachi Wishmaker, where an evil being in the form of a Groudon is formed from the energy of Jirachi.</description>

In the legend surrounding the three, Rayquaza represents the sky, while Kyogre and Groudon represent the sea and the land, respectively. Rayquaza resides within the ozone layer of the Earth and has lived there for hundreds of millions of years without ever descending. To those who have observed Rayquaza from the surface of the planet, Rayquaza has always appeared to be a zooming meteor. Rayquaza feeds on water and particles in the Earth`s atmosphere. It is said to only descend from the ozone layer if Kyogre and Groudon were to fight, in order to end the feud and maintain the balance of nature.
In Pokémon Emerald, Rayquaza is seen in a series of cutscenes. Once the player progresses past the Magma and Aqua Hideouts, Kyogre and Groudon wake up and start fighting, with the Red and Blue Orbs unable to control them. It is eventually sought out at the Sky Pillar, and eventually forces the two to cease their battle. Rayquaza appears as a boss character in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games, where the main team has to fight it in order to have it annihilate a falling star hurtling towards the planet.
Rayquaza is featured in the seventh Pokémon movie, Destiny Deoxys. Four years prior to the main events of the movie, Rayquaza is nearly injured in the ozone layer by the passage of a meteor containing the essence of Deoxys. Rayquaza seemingly destroys the Deoxys afterwards, but it is eventually revived. Rayquaza goes after it again, but after being rescued by it, Rayquaza decides that it isn`t an enemy, and returns to the atmosphere.</description>

<description>Deoxys (pronounced /di`ɑks.ɪs/) is a Pokémon formed from a mutation of a extraterrestrial virus exposed to a laser beam. It has psychokinetic powers and a high intelligence along with a crystalline organ on its chest that acts as its brain and shoots lasers. It has the ability to transform into four different forms, each with a specific purpose: Normal, Attack, Defense, and Speed. In the third generation of games, the form is based upon the game the Deoxys is contained within. As of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, it can freely change by interacting with the four meteorites in Veilstone City.
Deoxys` name is based on "Deoxyribonucleic acid", or DNA, which is the base of all life and contains instructions for every part of it.
Deoxys first appeared in the seventh Pokémon film, http://anidb.net/a2371 [Pokémon: Destiny Deoxys]. In the film, it demonstrated the ability to switch between its forms, create shadow copies for use as drones, regenerate missing body parts, launch an aurora into the sky, and erect a city-size force field which keeps nearly every sort of machine within from operating. The film also demonstrated that Deoxys is not a one-of-a-kind unique species like Rayquaza; more than one Deoxys is seen.
In early 2005, NASA began a cross-promotion with Nintendo and the Pokémon Company to provide an "edutainment" program for children across the United States by Internet, teaching the science behind various Pokémon characters as they appear in Trading Card Game expansions. In the first segment of the program, based on the newly-released EX: Deoxys Trading Card Game expansion, they used the character of Deoxys to teach children about outer space, anatomy of a virus, the meaning of DNA, the existence of the ozone layer, and a definition of an extraterrestrial. Since then the program has had two other segments covering the next two expansions: EX Emerald and EX Unseen Forces.

<description>Turtwig are small, turtle-like Pokémon, and are one of the three starter Pokémon for the Sinnoh region. Its prominent jawbone may denote a relationship to the snapping turtle. Its green and yellow body is covered by a shell. A small seedling grows on its head, similar to the plant bulb on Bulbasaur`s back and the leaf on Chikorita`s head.
The soil-based shell on its back grows stronger when it absorbs water. Turtwig survives by carrying out photosynthesis with its whole body. The leaf on its head will wilt if it becomes thirsty. As a result, it lives in areas that are close to lakes.
Turtwig makes its first Pokémon anime appearance in the first episode of the Diamond and Pearl series, "Following a Maiden Voyage!", where it is shown as one of the three Sinnoh starter Pokémon in Professor Rowan`s lab. Ash catches a wild Turtwig in the episode: "Gettin` Twiggy With It," and Turtwig also makes an appearance in "The Grass-Type is Always Greener!" as one of the Pokémon used by Eterna City`s Gym Leader Gardenia.</description>

<description>Kricketot has two large antennae function not only as feelers, but also as a musical instrument. In order to create sounds, it swings its head around, causing the feelers to collide and make a sound like a xylophone. Kricketot`s design is based on a composer or conductor; its body resembles an orchestra conductor`s costume. Kricketot only learns growl and bide similar to Seedot.
Collars of the female are noticeably larger than those of the male.
Also, it should be noticed that the antenna of Kricketot appear to be a raised version of Kricketune`s mustache.
Oddly, it is strikingly similar to Volbeat and Illumise, due to similar head collars, and that it has antennas. However, besides the fact that they are both bug types, they are not related in any way.</description>

<description>Kricketune resembles a dark red cricket standing upright. Its forearms curve into scythe-like shapes (compare with Scyther), perhaps resembling conductor`s batons. It also has two large whiskers resembling a handlebar mustache above the nose. The "mustache" on the female is slightly smaller than the male`s. Kricketot`s name originates from the words cricket, spelled with a "K," and tune, as in a musical tune.
Its appearance resembles a violin, or double bass, with string-like lines on its neck. Due to these traits, its design could have been influenced by the real life violin beetle. But with its scythes, or bows (for a violin), it could most likely be instrument-designed, like its pre-evolution, Kricketot.
Because of it`s musical nature, Nando owns one as well.</description>

<description>Budew is a dual-type Grass/Poison Pokémon.
It evolves into Roselia by happiness during the day, whom evolves into Roserade by Shiny Stone.
At first glance, Budew barely has any similarities to its evolved forms, Roselia and Roserade. However, when the two "vines" that are on top of Budew`s head open up, a big spot can be seen on each vine (one that is blue and the other being red). As a matter of fact, the two vines are actually what will be the Pokémon`s flower-holding arms when it evolves into Roselia. Budew also appears to be wearing a green bib. This will become a skirt once it evolves.</description>

<description>Burmy is a Bagworm Pokémon that can take on three forms by making cloaks out of different materials depending on where it battles. In grassy areas, it creates a cloak of twigs and leaves that also protects it from cold winds. In caves, it makes a cloak out of sand and dirt. In buildings, it uses trash and other materials to make its cloak. If the cloak is broken in battle, it makes a new one quickly. Upon evolution, if female, a Burmy will evolve into Wormadam, which also takes on a form similar to the cloak the Burmy was wearing, while male Burmy evolve into Mothim.</description>

They feed on honey collected by other Combee, and protect the Vespiquen if its in danger. The jewel that is located on the head of every Vespiquen is used in battle to collect rays of light that can be reflected and fired at any enemy at will. Vespiquen can also learn three powerful order attacks (Attack Order, Heal Order, and Defense Order) which it uses to call its fellow Combee for help on defending itself, healing itself, or attacking an enemy. Vespiquen is always female, as such only female Combees can evolve into it.</description>

In Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, its Flower Gift ability strengthens it and another Pokémon when it is sunny. Cherrim learns the existing attack Sunny Day to make the weather sunny, as well as a new attack called Lucky Chant, which prevents critical hits. Cherrim can also learn a new attack, Worry Seed, which temporarily changes the target`s ability to Insomnia.</description>

It is exclusive to Pokémon Pearl, where Glameow is used by many of the members of the Team Galactic antagonists; Galactic Commander Mars uses a Purugly. These Pokémon are surprisingly quick for being so robust. As to confirm a Glameow`s transition from slender to fat during evolution, a Glameow with the Limber ability will exchange it for the Thick Fat ability during evolution. A Purugly can also have the Own Tempo ability, which prevents confusion.</description>

<description>Bonsly is a small pot-like creature resembling a bonsai tree. The creature was introduced in 2004 in an issue of Coro Coro Magazine. Bonsly makes its proper and most playable debut in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, the game it was first advertised as being involved in.
Despite its tree-like appearance, Bonsly is actually made of rock. Bonsly often shed tears, though it has been found out that those are "fake tears", and that it is adjusting its body fluid level (appropriately enough, it can learn the move Fake Tears, which sharply decreases its target`s Special Defense) Wild Bonsly exist only in the Pearl Version, and upon learning how to Mimic, they evolve into the familiar Sudowoodo.
Its first anime appearance is in the eighth Pokémon movie, Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. However, its name is mispronounced in that movie; Bonsly is to be pronounced similarly to "bonsai", half of its namesake, the other being sly, for shedding "crocodile tears" Bonsly also appears in the "From Cradle to Save" episode, where Brock obtains it. Brock`s Bonsly eventually evolved into Sudowoodo.
Although regarded as a 4th generation Pokémon, it was included in the 2005 game Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, where the player must rescue one from the wreckage of S.S. Libra and reunite it with its trainer, a small girl. It also appears as a statue in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon as a reward.</description>

It may or may not be able to comprehend what it is actually saying though, much like real parrots. If they gather, they all learn the same saying. It can also mimic sounds. When a Chatot learns its signature move Chatter, the trainer can record a custom call from the game menu. The sound is garbled to avoid the recording of obscenities. The player can trade this Pokemon for a Buizel in Eterna City.
Its head is shaped like a musical note and its tail like a metronome. Its body is covered with many multi-colored feathers giving it a resemblance to a black masked lovebird. Chatot can only be caught in the morning or during the day.
Chatot also appears in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time/Darkness as the second in command to Guildmaster Wigglytuff.</description>

<description>Spiritomb, along with Sableye, shares the distinction of being one of only two Pokémon with no weakness. Since it is a combination Ghost/Dark type, no attack is "super effective" against it under normal circumstances. In addition, both Spiritomb and Sableye are, due to their typing, completely immune to Counter and Mirror Coat (unless moves such as Foresight or Miracle Eye are used), but not Metal Burst. Moves like Foresight and the ability Scrappy can negate its immunity to Fighting and Normal, allowing opponents to hit the Fighting weakness of its Dark typing. Its ability, Pressure, doubles the PP cost of any moves used by a foe. This ability, combined with its resistances and wide movepool of defensive moves, makes it a highly effective "tank".
According to its Pokédex entry, Spiritomb is a single entity composed of 108 evil spirits. Spiritomb has a strange connection to the number 108, being 108 kilograms (238.1 lbs.), #108 in the Sinnoh Pokedex, and having 108 as its base stat in defense and special defense. The number 108 is sacred in Hinduism and Buddhism. The entry also mentions that it was bound to a fissure in an Odd Keystone as punishment for misdeeds done 500 years ago. Also, if you take the difference between Spiritomb`s level-up moves (6), and multiply it by the total number of moves it can learn through level-up and egg moves (not counting repeats, 18), you get 108.
Champion Cynthia of the Sinnoh Pokémon League uses a Spiritomb in her team. It is level 61.</description>

<description>Munchlax is the pre-evolved form of Snorlax. It wolfs down its weight in food once a day, swallowing food whole with almost no chewing. It hides food under its long body hair. However, it sometimes forgets it has hidden the food there. Munchlax behaves quite opposite of its evolution, Snorlax, as it is somewhat hyperactive, though it is very similar with its eating patterns. It does not mind walking and running from place to place as it looks for food. Munchlax eats the most food of any Pokémon besides its evolution, Snorlax. It will eat nearly anything. It can rarely become full and will eat constantly, unlike Snorlax, who eats in between sleeping.
One can obtain a Munchlax by breeding two Snorlax with the mother holding a Full Incense, or by smearing honey on trees and waiting to see if it appears. However, it is the rarest Pokémon to catch by doing so. Wild Munchlax can only be found in honey trees in the games.</description>

<description>Hippopotas can be found in the Ruin Maniac`s cave. It is fairly rare, though will appear more often as the length of the cave increases. This Pokémon and its evolutions have quite different gender forms. The female has a brown replacing the color on the snout and on its body, while the male is a yellowish tan. Unlike the aquatic animal the Hippopotamus, which is what`s it`s loosely based on, Hippopotas lives in deserts, and hates getting wet; however, it is one of the few non-water ground type Pokémon that can learn Water Pulse.</description>

<description>Hippowdon is the evolved form of Hippopotas. Sand appears to be coming out of the holes on its back. Its mouth can span seven feet. It is also mentioned, in a bookcase in Harbor Inn in Canalave City, that this Pokémon created the deserts of the world, but the spirit of the desert is Flygon, and the heat was created by Camerupt. Males are colored yellow, while females are colored black. It is interesting to note that males are yellow, so that in their desert environments, they have trouble finding each other to fight. The female is colored black for the opposite reason, so she is easy to find. In the 4th gen game series for Nintendo DS, Hippowdon has the special ability called "Sand Stream", which whips up a sandstorm whenever it is introduced into battle. The sandstorm will continue until another weather condition is set, or if for example Rayquaza is switched in (because Rayquaza has an ability to negate weather effects).</description>

Its tail is used for gripping prey and injecting poison into them. It ambushes prey by hiding in the sand and waiting patiently.
Skorupi has 2 abilities: Battle Armor, preventing critical hits on Skorupi, and Sniper (a newer ability) , which triples the damage of an attack instead of doubling it during the case of a critical hit. The only place you can get some Skorupi is in the Safari Zone.</description>

These arms are mounted on the sides of its head, which has a full 360-degree field of view. This gives Drapion a much large range of attack. Drapion is only weak to Ground Type Pokemon.

<description>Croagunk uses the poison sacks in its cheeks to communicate with others. Its move Poison Jab has a tendency to stun Pokémon and people. Male Croagunk differ from female Croagunk in that the white bands on their chests are lower than in the female, as well as the black band on both arms. Croagunk and its evolutionary form, Toxicroak, are a combination Poison/Fighting type, making it weak against Psychic moves, Flying moves, and Ground moves, but strong against Grass moves, Fighting moves, Poison moves, Dark moves, Bug moves, and Rock moves.
In the anime, Team Rocket leaves a Croagunk in the episode "Gymbaliar". Brock later befriends it and captures it. It has been known to use its Poison Jab move on Brock when he expresses interest in any woman. It takes the role of Misty and Max. It is a powerful fighter and only known losses were to Paul`s Torterra and Dawn`s Aipom, though it fought many Pokémon before it under Jessie`s control without rest.</description>

<description>Snover is a "frosted tree Pokémon," that first appeared in the 4th generation of Pokémon. Snover is a small, tree-like Pokémon that appears mid to late game. On its head it has a white hat-like structure resembling a mountain with three peaks.
In the spring, frozen candy-like berries grow around its stomach which are similar to frozen treats. Because of its lack of human contact, Snover is known to be boldly inquisitive. Male and female Snover vary in appearance by their stomach`s pattern, with the male having an extra brown zigzag. Snover, and its evolution Abomasnow, is a unique Grass/Ice type, giving it many different abilities than most Grass or Ice types. Its Grass/Ice combination, unfortunately, makes it weak against Fire types, Fighting types, Poison types, Flying types, Bug types, Rock types, and Steel types. On the plus side, the Grass/Ice combination makes Snover and its evolutionary form, Abomasnow, strong against Water types, Electric types, Grass types, and Ground types.
The ability Snow Warning is also unique to Snover`s line, and causes the weather to change to hail when Snover is brought into battle. This hail does not disappear over time, but must be overridden by another weather changing move or ability.</description>

Weavile have three claws on each paw, instead of two like its pre-evolved form, Sneasel. A female Weavile has smaller ears than a male one. Weavile are known to travel and live in mating pairs and are very mischievous. They are also known to travel in larger groups as well of about four to five individuals, living in cold climates and hunting prey with impressive coordination. They convey messages to others by scratching odd symbols in ice or on the bark of trees. They made their first appearance in the 8th movie, Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. Sneasel evolves into Weavile when it levels up at night while holding the Razor Claw item.</description>

<description>Magnezone, known as the Magnet Area Pokémon, is the evolution of Magneton, and has an appearance similar to that of a UFO. Magneton evolves from exposure to a unique magnetic field, which can only be found inside Mt. Coronet in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. This causes a mutation in the Magneton; one of the Magnemite that this Pokémon consists of has grown bigger than the other two; its pupil has dilated and turned red; and the screw on top appears to have been replaced by a yellow antenna upon evolution. The remaining Magnemite form the "shoulders" of Magnezone, and the screws on the top of their head have grown significantly larger. They also appear to have lost one magnet each. Magnezone has three horse-shoe magnets. Two are positioned in a fashion that resembles a pair of claws, and a third is positioned as a tail. Its body is surrounded by a thin metal rim. It is approximately three times heavier than Magneton. The body has a silver color like Magnezone`s pre-evolved forms. "Magneton must level up in Mt. Coronet in order to evolve"
In Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Darkness, a Magnezone serves as the police chief, taking away the outlaws the main character defeats.</description>

<description>Lickilicky, known as the Licking Pokémon, is one of several Pokémon of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl that evolve from a Pokémon from a previous generation, Lickitung. It does so when it knows the move Rollout and levels up, but only in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. This fact makes it one of only four Pokémon (the others being Mamoswine, Tangrowth, and Yanmega) that evolve from a previously obtainable Pokémon in a way that would have been possible in previous games: by learning a certain move. Not much else can be discerned from Lickilicky`s pre-evolved form, except it can learn Explosion, meaning that it is the only Pokémon (besides Smeargle through its unique Sketch move) that can learn Explosion and receive a Same Type Attack Bonus from it as well. It has a bizarre, rather swirly protusion on its head resembling hair. Lickilicky also has thumb spikes, and a white bib-like pattern on its chest in front of the neck. This design may be based on old 60-70`s diner mascots.</description>

It stands completely upright, and its color has changed from gray to black with burnt orange plates, formed by a type of biological "fusion" with the Protector item, needed for Rhydon to evolve. Its second horn grew out from a Rhydon having the main horn pointed forward. The female`s upper horn is smaller. In addition to its extra armor, it has developed an Ankylosaur-like tail, and holes in the palms of its hands, which it uses to fire rocks at enemies, thus why it learns the move Rock Wrecker. According to the Pokédex, it sometimes accidentally fires Geodude instead of rocks.</description>

It also has two long, viny arms with three fingers each. Females tend to have more red on the fingers. Tangrowth uses its arms to trip prey. It also doesn`t mind if its arms get torn off by enemies, because they soon regrow. Tangrowth`s vines also seem to have morphed together, whereas Tangela`s vines are all completely separate. Tangela must learn AncientPower in order to evolve in Tangrowth.</description>

The location necessary to evolve Eevee into Glaceon is on route 217 in the Sinnoh region. There is an ice covered rock here, but it is also possible to level up anywhere in grass on route 217 to evolve. Being an ice-type, it prefers cold climates, and as a protective measure it freezes its fur completely. This freezing causes the hair to resemble "ice needles."
In the Anime, May`s Eevee evolved into a Glaceon prior to her reappearance in the episode 544 `Restaurant Seven Stars! Tag Battle for a Full Course!` and Bianca got a same Eevee and now evolved into Glaceon nicknamed Iceshocker.</description>

It has two fully developed pincers for hands and has two barbs on its tail, as opposed to Gligar`s one, giving its tail the resemblance of vampire`s fangs. It is also one of the few Pokémon who can not learn STAB attacks through leveling-up, only through TMs.
In the Anime, Paul is seen catching a Gliscor, which was the leader of a group of Gligars. Ash`s Gligar eventually evolves into Gliscor.</description>

It also bears a small resemblance to the Nintendo character Mario.[citation needed] Its nose is much bigger in proportion to its body and has a bushy "moustache." The "moustache" appears to be iron filings caught by a magnet. Female Probopass retain the "moustache", despite the existence of gender differences for various different Pokémon species. It controls three small objects on its sides and back that look like Nosepass, which are not connected to the body; they are called "mini-noses" by the in-game Pokédex entry.</description>

<description>Dusknoir, known as the Gripper Pokémon, is the evolution of Dusclops, obtained by trading a Dusclops that is holding a Reaper Cloth. It appears only in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. Dusknoir`s body is mostly black, with four almond shaped eye-like markings (two in the front, two in the back) and a yellow horizontal zigzag line below the "eyes" along which the entire torso can open and close like a mouth, giving the impression of a face. This "face" also glows brightly when Dusknoir powers up for attacks. Dusknoir now has developed arms. Two yellow bands are near its wrists and its grey hands are similar to Dusclops`. Dusknoir has a grey, cylinder-shaped head with another yellow band near the top and a single black eye with a yellow iris and a red pupil. On top of its head is a yellow antenna which allows this Pokémon to receive transmissions from the spirit world, from where it receives commands to take people there; due to the presence of an actual "spirit world" in the games ruled by the Legendary Pokémon Giratina, a ghastly dragon that represents death, it is speculated that it is Giratina that gives orders to Dusknoir. In addition, it may have ties to the Grim Reaper, as the player needs a Reaper Cloth in order for it to evolve as well as it being a Gripper Pokemon, a possible portmanteau of "Grim" and "Reaper" altered to fit Dusknoir`s grabbing persona. Dusknoir has a ghostly tail instead of feet like Dusclops, resembling the stereotypical depiction of a genie. Its name can be translated as "black dusk", "noir" meaning "black" in French.
A male Dusknoir appears in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness as the main villain of the game. He is a tyrant from the future world and deceives everyone into trusting him and outing Grovyle as a villain, but in fact, he is an agent of Primal Dialga</description>

<description>Froslass, known as the Snow Land Pokémon, appears to be based on the Yuki-onna, a Japanese snow spirit, hence being a Ghost-type. It bears a humanoid appearance (unlike Snorunt or Glalie). Its main body color is white with a red stripe around the waist and two red fins on her back (designed to resemble a kimono obi). Froslass`s arms are attached to its head as opposed to its torso, and each has a three-fingered hand and a blue fin on the wrist (representing the sleeves of a kimono). The head is round except for a bump on the back and has a purple lower jaw. Two small blue "horns" made of ice are on Froslass`s head, along with a purple diamond-shaped crater in the center of its forehead. Froslass doesn`t have any feet, so it floats in the air like its counter-part, Glalie. Its torso appears to be hollow, as it is stated in the Pokédex`s entry for Froslass. A female Snorunt will evolve into Froslass after a Dawn Stone is used on it.
It attacks prey and unsuspecting victims in icy snowstorms, where its Snow Cloak ability allows it to go unseen (yuki-onna are said to have skin so pale that they can actually blend into their snow-covered surroundings). To render its foes and victims helpless, it blows an icy wind that can reach as low as -60˚F. Its head has a slight resemblance to Celebi`s.
A Froslass appears in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness, as a dangerous and obsessive Pokémon, who is attracted to the famous explorer Scizor, who doesn`t exactly return those affections. As a result, she kidnaps him and freezes him in ice. But when the player and partner intervene, Frosslass is stopped.</description>

<description>Rotom, known as the Plasma Pokémon, is a small, floating Pokémon whose body consists of plasma, which can infiltrate electronic devices. They are mischievous, and wreak havoc on electrical appliances just for the fun of it. Pokémon Platinum introduced five new forms of Rotom: Frost Rotom, Wash Rotom, Mow Rotom, Fan Rotom, and Heat Rotom. Each form`s appearance corresponds to a household appliance (a refrigerator, a washing machine, a lawn mower, a desk fan, and an oven, respectively). In the Pokémon universe, researchers are looking into Rotom as the power source of a unique motor.
Rotom are shaped like lightning rods, while the blue aura of electricity around them takes the appearance of lightning. Rotom`s eyes and aura of electricity change colors when it changes form. Rotom`s looks and abilities were inspired by Pulseman, a game that GameFreak worked on before Pokémon. Rotom is the word motor backwards; this may refer to the fact that motors make many appliances function, while Rotom makes them fail.
The only available Rotom in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl resides in a possessed television in an old haunted château. You can only catch him after 8:00 PM but before 4:00 AM. In North America, Toys R Us gave out Secret Keys, which unlocked Rotom`s forms, via Mystery Gift from April 20, 2009 to May 12, 2009. The alternate forms of Rotom may also be accessed in Silph Co. in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver. In the anime, Rotom made its debut appearance in Get Your Rotom Running! in all its different forms, toying around with Ash and friends. In Pokémon Adventures, Rotom appeared in the television at the Old Chateau.</description>

<description>Uxie, known as the Knowledge Pokémon, has a yellow and round head with a jewel (probably a ruby), embedded in its forehead, and in its Sugimori art it appears to be sleeping, or closing its eyes in deep thought. Uxie`s name comes from the word pixie, a small mythical creature, and "you", U being short for it. The other members of the Psychic-type, Mew like Lake Trio, Mesprit and Azelf, represent "me" and "us", respectively. It is also a possibility that these three Pokémon are inspired from a trio of Arabian goddesses, Al-Lat (Azelf), Manat (Mesprit), and Al-Uzza (Uxie). This is further supported by their moniker as Mirage Pokémon (as mirages are something associated with the Arabian desert), and that the three appear to be wearing jeweled turbans, which are associated with Arabic royalty. Uxie`s eyelids are also yellow, although they are obviously not part of the top of the head where the other yellow is. Uxie also resembles a religious monk. Its head resembles a human brain, since it is the Knowledge Pokémon. Like Mesprit and Azelf, its partners in the legendary trio, it has two tails with jewels embedded in them, and the only major difference between them is their heads and their faces. It is also believed that the mystic trio was all hatched from the same egg.
Uxie is referred to as "The Being of Knowledge". It is said that the wisdom that enriches the lives of humans was brought with the birth of Uxie. Similar to the legend of the basilisk where the basilisk could cause death by a single glance, Uxie can cause a complete loss of memory by a single glance of its open eyes; hence, its eyes are always closed, even when it is in battle.</description>

<description>Mesprit, known as the Emotion Pokémon, is a legendary Pokémon that is part of the Psychic-type Lake Trio along with Uxie and Azelf. Mesprit`s name comes from the word sprite, a tiny fairy found in fantasy and fairy tales, or spirit, as its spirit often exits its body, leaving it on the bottom of Lake Verity. It has a small blue body about the size of Mew, and is identical to Uxie and Azelf except for its head. It has a pink head with a jewel embedded in its forehead, and four long ears drooping down its head looking like those of Lucario.
Mesprit is referred to as "The Being of Emotion," and said to have taught humans to sense emotions such as sorrow, pain and joy. If a human touches it, three days after the touch, the person will lose their emotions. Cyrus is one example. When you attempt to capture it, it will roam around Sinnoh. It is thought to have come from the same egg as Uxie and Azelf.</description>

It is similar to the three Regis - Regirock, Regice, and Registeel - in both name, body structure and the fact that all Regis are weak to Fighting-type attacks. It will only appear in the game if the three Regis, after being transferred via Pal Park, are in your party while examining Regigigas` body. Regigigas was sealed in the Snowpoint Temple for thousands of years, so long that moss have grown over its body, and modern humans thought it was just a statue of the Pokémon. A Sinnoh legend has it in the past Regigigas towed continents using ropes. The legend says that it had unbelievable strength, but seemingly since it has not used it in ages, it has trouble getting its act together at the beginning of a battle, evidenced by its ability, Slow Start. In Platinum, Regigigas` level is reduced to 1, making it the lowest level non-glitch wild &amp; legendary Pokémon, more evidence of the fact that it has not used its powers for millennia.</description>

<description>Phione, known as the Sea Drifter Pokémon, is a Pokémon that can be obtained by breeding Manaphy and Ditto, though Phione will not evolve into Manaphy.
It is currently the only Pokémon that cannot evolve into the Pokémon from which it is bred, and it is the only Pokémon able to be bred from a legendary. Phione itself can breed with Ditto, but it will only produce other Phione and not a Manaphy. Because of Phione`s relation to Manaphy, there is evidence on both sides of the issue of Phione`s status (or lack thereof) as a legendary Pokémon. As it is the offspring of a legendary, and is banned from the Sinnoh Battle Tower, many people think it is a legendary. However, its lackluster stats and ability to breed more of itself lent evidence to the idea that Phione was not a legendary. Its legendary status was eventually confirmed by Pokemon.com. Many things that Manaphy has two of, Phione only has one of (Phione has one antenna, only one gem on its stomach, and has one "eyelash" coming from each eye, while Manaphy has two of these).
Since it is the product of a bred Manaphy, they share many traits. It is the same shade of blue, it has the same large eyes, only blue, and has eyelash markings similar to Manaphy. It has a large knob-shaped bump on its head from which extends a long, ribbon-like antenna, somewhat resembling a sailor`s cap, though in fact it is a flotation device. Instead of feet, it has a small point, similar to Baltoy. Instead of two jewels, it has a single red gem in the middle of its tiny body. It has two large fins in proportion to its body, which it uses to navigate through the oceans that it lives in. While Manaphy is said to live in cold seas, it is said Phione live in warm seas.</description>

<description>Darkrai, known as the Pitch-Black Pokémon, is a legendary Pokémon resembling a dark, sinister ghost, such as the Grim Reaper. Darkrai is a living nightmare, or a manifestation of many nightmares. Darkrai is made by necromancy and pitch-black magic. The top of its body is connected to the lower half by a tiny waist, giving it a figure shaped like an hourglass. A white substance flows from its head, obscuring much of its facial features. Its club-shaped arms have three claws each, with parts of them appearing tattered. It`s shoulders also have long tatters as well. Darkrai possesses the power to lure people into deep sleeps and show them frightning nightmares, which sometimes make it impossible to wake up. Darkrai resides on Newmoon Island, (Mirror-image of fullmoon island in which Cresselia resides) and on nights of the new moon; when it is active, it shows horrible nightmares.
Darkrai was released on July 19th, 2007 in Japan with the movie Dialga vs. Palkia vs. Darkrai, and it was released in the United States in Toys R` Us stores shortly after the showing of the English adaptation, The Rise of Darkrai. In the anime, it was featured in the movie Pokémon: The Rise of Darkrai, in which it stops Palkia and Dialga from destroying Alamos Town. He was voiced by Bill Rogers in the film.
It is the only Dark-type legendary Pokémon to date, unless Arceus is holding the Dread Plate. Its signature move, "Dark Void", attempts to put all opponents to sleep. Coupled with excellent offenses, Darkrai is not permitted in standard battling.</description>

Its body`s fur is pure white and instead of quills, Shaymin has green grass growing on its back along with pink flowers growing on the sides of its head, giving it an even more flower-like appearance. Its cry is similar to birdsong. Shaymin resides in the Flower Paradise, a flower-filled field untouched by humans. You find it at level 30. In order to go unnoticed by intruders or attackers, it utilizes its own form of camouflage, rolling up into a ball resembling a flower in a patch of grass. By doing so, it blends in with the surrounding flowers, going undetected even if the attacker is beside it. Shaymin also has the power to decompose the toxins in the air and turn the land into flower fields in an instant. It is rumored to have turned the desolate area of Floaroma Town into a fertile field. The only way to capture Shaymin without the use of glitches or cheats is to receive the item Oak`s Letter from a Nintendo Event. It is featured in the movie Giratina and the Sky Warrior. A new form has been confirmed for Shaymin called the Sky Forme, which appears in Pokemon Platinum; in this form, it appears more as a terrier than it does a hedgehog, and has large wing-like ears. Its signature move is "Seed Flare".</description>

<description>Giratina, known as the Renegade Pokémon, is one of the legendary Pokémon that premiered in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. Giratina represents the Dimensions (or perhaps inter-dimensional travel, because space and time, which lie under the control of Palkia and Dialga respectively, are dimensions in themselves). Giratina is described in the Pokémon video games as a creature that lives in a world on the reverse side of the human world. This area is in a cemetery-like ruin in the depths of Turnback Cave, a place where the dimensional boundaries are said to be distorted, and dead Pokémon are able to enter the physical world. Giratina has a long, platinum-colored, segmented body with six legs, and has ghostly wings with spikes. Giratina is featured prominently in the upcoming film `Giratina and the Sky`s Warrior` (Giratina to Sora no Hanataba: Sheimi) and in the game Pokémon Platinum where it has a new form called "Origin Forme" (オリジンフォルム), which is similar to its regular form except it has a slightly different face, wing shape, and spikes in place of legs, becoming more serpentine.
Giratina is infamous as an extremely durable wall, with astronomical defensive statistics. Its Origin Forme trades its defenses for improved offenses, but it is limited to the Platinum Orb as a hold item.
Giratina`s Another Forme looks like a basilisk, it has a beak-like mouth, it has a crown on the head, it has red eyes, it has big spikey wings, it has six legs, a serpent tail, and a bird-like cry.</description>

<description>Team Galactic is the villainous team in Sinnoh.
They first appeared in "A Secret Sphere of Influence!", though it was only a brief cameo at the end. They assigned the Team Rocket trio of Jessie, James, and Meowth to steal the Adamant Orb for them. Both Brock and Officer Jenny believed that the trio had been assigned to this work by Butch and Cassidy or Pokémon Hunter J.
In their next appearance in "Journey to the Unown!", Saturn brings the two grunts into the Solaceon Ruins. The Team Rocket trio observe them, following them inside. Using three Plates, Saturn obtains a cube inside of the ruins, enraging the Unown and causing general chaos inside of the ruins. Before leaving, Saturn thanks the Team Rocket trio for their assistance in the earlier episode and his group escapes with his Bronzor.
Team Galactic appeared again in "Enter Galactic!", where Saturn appears yet again. After exposing the obtained cube to the Veilstone City meteorites, it transforms into the Spear Key. This episode is also the time when Ash and his friends finally encounter them. Their mission this time is apparently to steal some of Veilstone City`s meteors. Saturn also battles Brock with their Toxicroak and Croagunk, respectively. However, no thanks to Ash, Dawn, Officer Jenny, and Paul`s Electabuzz, the battle ends up in a draw and the mission is a complete failure, leaving Team Galactic to retreat.
They appeared in DP096 and DP097, when Mars, Jupiter and Cyrus debuted in the anime. In the episodes, they steal the Lustrous Orb and the Adamant Orb from the Celestic Town museum. Later, it is stated that the Veilstone City meteorites were sent to the Fuego Ironworks as part of the Red Chain project.
They also appear in the opening "High Touch!".
Unlike in the games, most of the main characters know Team Galactic`s goal is to control Dialga and Palkia.</description>

<description>Team Rocket is a highly organized criminal syndicate "in pursuit of evil" headed by Giovanni (called "The Boss" by his underlings) and based in Kanto. Its main focus is in stealing or capturing, then selling, rare and/or strong Pokemon, but it also conducts cruel experimental research on Pokemon. According to the Generation II games, the Team Rocket Oath says: "Steal Pokemon for profit. Exploit Pokemon for profit. All Pokemon exist for the glory of Team Rocket." Team Rocket`s final goal is to take over the world using Pokemon.
In the anime, Team Rocket is based in Kanto, with many smaller branches reaching out in Kanto and Johto. Giovanni is the Gym Leader of Viridian City during the early part of Ash`s journey. There is also an underground school for training aspiring Team Rocket members. In addition, Team Rocket had its headquarters near Pallet Town and Viridian City, but this was destroyed by Mewtwo in its rage; it is unknown where the headquarters are now. All that is known is that the headquarters are now in a large building built at the end of a canyon and guarded by many grunts, seen when Jessie, James, and Meowth returned from the Hoenn region to report back to Giovanni.</description>

<description>Sakaki is the head of Team Rocket, and formerly served as the Gym Leader of Viridian City`s Gym, known officially as the Viridian Gym. He handed out the Earth Badge to Trainers who defeated him. As a Gym Leader, he specialized in Ground-type Pokémon, but his master plan includes collecting rare Pokémon of all types.
Very little is known about his past in any timeline; he is generally shrouded in mystery. However, certain things are known:
His mother was the head of Team Rocket before him. However, this is presumed to be canon in the anime timeline only, as the games have no precedent for this.
While Sakaki very rarely takes the role of antagonist, his agents often have him in mind during missions due to the chance of power, be it through promotion or other means. This gave him a unique series of appearances, mainly during the Hoenn saga, where Nyarth often saw how the Pokémon in each episode could be used to help Sakaki and win the trio promotions. These boss fantasies never show his actual personality and occasionally even show Sakaki in chibi form.
The only time Sakaki has been seen in battle was in The Battle for the Badge. He used powerful Pokémon against Shigeru but later left the Gym to deal with an unexplained emergency, leaving Satoshi to battle Musashi. By the time Satoshi returned from Hoenn, Agatha was in charge of the Gym until a new leader could be found. Sakaki`s reasons for leaving it have not been explained, though it is speculated to be linked with the events of the aforementioned episode.
Sakaki is one of the three most prominent figures speculated to be Satoshi`s father, alongside Professor Okido and Silver. There is no evidence to support this, though Diamondshippers see Sakaki`s avoidance of Satoshi mentioned above as suspicious. In Pokémon Live!, it was claimed that Sakaki and Delia had shared a relationship as teenagers, though it is also stated that someone else is Satoshi`s father in that particular canon.</description>

<description>Jessie is one half of of the Team Rocket duo that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokemon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
Jessie`s mother, Miyamoto, was a high-ranking Team Rocket agent. When Jessie was around the age of three, Miyamoto left on a mission to the Andes Mountains to record the voice of the elusive Pokemon Mew. However, Miyamoto disappeared, and Jessie was put into a foster home which had very little money. There were times when she had no choice but to eat snow because of a lack of more nourishing food.
When she was old enough, she left home to become a Pokemon nurse in Jouto. However, the school she was enrolled in was literally for Pokemon nurses (i.e. Chansey), so she failed to graduate and left, leaving behind a Chansey she had befriended there. It is assumed that she then traveled back to Kanto, where she enrolled in Pokemon Tech, a trainer`s school, met James, and subsequently failed and dropped out. After this, Jessie and James joined a bicycle gang in Sunny Town, where Jessie was known for swinging a chain above her head as she rode her bike (nicknamed "Chainer Jess").
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between Jessie and James after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Sometime before joining Team Rocket, and it is not known when, Jessie obtained a Contest Pass in the Hoenn region. Also during the years before Team Rocket, she had several boyfriends, all of whom left her and/or treated her badly. In "Xatu the Future", she revealed that she had once worked at a T.V. station as the Weathergirl. In "From Cradle to Save" is also revealed that she once was a ninja.
She has a long-standing bitter rivalry with Cassidy, another member of Team Rocket. Another member, Wendy, held a grudge against Jessie for failing to pay for a drink (making Wendy pay), but got her revenge when she added the charge to Jessie`s overall Team Rocket bill.
In the episode "Ignorance is Blissey", Jessie was reunited with her friend Chansey from the Pokemon nurse school; Chansey had since evolved into a Blissey.
Starting in Hoenn, Jessie has become a Pokemon Coordinator, entering every contest that she could. She frequently makes it to the battle round, but usually loses there. However, in "Borrowing on Bad Faith", she finally succeeded in winning an (unofficial) contest by using Ash`s Aipom, which she had saved earlier in the episode. And, in "Team Shocker!", she finally wins an official contest with her Dustox in at Solaceon City. Later she also won a ribbon with help of her Yanmega. She has Contest Passes to compete in the Hoenn, Kanto, and Sinnoh regions.
While Jessie`s role in the Pokemon anime has not yet ended, in Toshihiro Ono`s manga, "The Electric Tale of Pikachu", she ended up married to James and with child.
Jessie seems to have a special preference for snake-like Pokemon, owning both an Arbok and a Seviper. In "The Ninja Poke Showdown", she expressed a preference for Poison-type Pokemon in general.
For unknown reasons, she, James and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation.
In the Kanto contests, Jessie disguises herself as Jessebella (which is similar to James former fiancee Jessiebelle) wearing a red dress and glasses. Eventually, Ash, Brock, Max and May finds out her true identity at the last contest.
During the Kanto Grand Festival, Jessie dresses up as Jessadia (Japanese: キャンディ・ムサリーナ Candy Musalina). and wears glasses, long white socks, a yellow and orange dress, and has her hair in pigtails. She works there as an announcer and Lilian Meridian`s assistant; Lilian herself says she may not really like "Jessadia"`s style, but recognizes her talent. In the Latin American dub, she enters Super Contests under the name Jessiebella (referencing Jessiebelle again). Jessie currently still continues to use the Jessalina disguise while participating in Super Contests.
In "Pruning a Passel of Pals!" and "Strategy With a Smile!" she once again used her Jessadia disguise to report on the Wallace Cup.
Although Jessie had entered mostly every contest in Hoenn &amp; Kanto, she lost in every single one, whether it was the first match of the Battle Rounds or the finals. But in the Sinnoh Region, she has so far won 2 ribbons using her Dustox and Yanmega.</description>

<description>Meowth is a very unique Pokémon as it has many of the characteristics of a human. It walks on two feet, talks and is as smart as any human. Meowth is currently a member of Team Rocket and he travels around with Jessie and James trying to capture Pikachu and other rare Pokémon for Giovanni.
Meowth generally finishes his sentences with "Nyaa (ニャー)" which is the equivalent of "meow" in English. This helps people remember that despite his ability to talk like a human, he still has cat character traits.
Meowth is also known for coming up with his many schemes to try to capture Pikachu. While Jessie and James always agree with Meowth and think his plans are brilliant, they are generally foiled by Ash and his friends.
Long Con to Access Raimon City Pokémon Center
Meowth schemed with Jessie, James and Doctor Zager to figure out a way for them to infiltrate the Raimon City Pokémon Center where high-leveled Pokémon are stored in a vault that is protected by a security machine scan system that would only open if Nurse Joy (Isshu) or Nurse Joy`s Audino were scanned. Meowth pretended to be no longer part of Team Rocket making up a story that his made an error while executing a certain operation and when headquarters hear of his mistake, they told him he was fired.
Ash, Iris and Cilan believed him and allowed Meowth to travel with him. Pikachu though didn`t trust Meowth even though Meowth proved on numerous occasion that it should be trusted. Meowth`s plan was put into action when they arrived at the Raimon City Pokémon Center and as soon as Nurse Joy`s Audino was scanned to open the door, Meowth turned on Pikachu and the other and captured all the Pokémon in the vault. The long con had been a success and Meowth met up with Jessie and James below the Pokémon Center. Unfortunately, they weren`t able to get away as Ash and his friends realized that Meowth had just been conning them and they were able to stop Team Rocket.</description>

<description>James is one part of of the Team Rocket trio that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokémon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
James is mostly a comedic parody of bishounen characters; the English dub in particular tends to give him a melodramatic and even campy tone. He is somewhat famous for carrying a rose, though in more recent episodes he does not display it often. Mostly, his rose is displayed in the Team Rocket motto.
The only child of millionaires, James was forced to endure formal society. At a young age, he was forcefully engaged to a girl of whom he was terrified, Jessiebelle, all because his parents wanted to have a wealthy daughter-in-law. Thus, he ran away from home, leaving behind his beloved pet Growlie. He attempted to enroll in Pokémon Tech, a trainer`s school, but, along with his new friend Jessie, flunked out. Then, with Jessie, he joined the Sunny Town bicycle gang, where he was popular for being the only gang member to have to use training wheels (nicknamed "Trainer Jim"). Eventually James, Jessie, and the bike gang went their separate ways.
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between James and Jessie after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Since he is proficient in several activities, including Pokémon haiku and PokéRinger, it is possible that he developed his skills during his temporary separation from Jessie, but this is not known for sure.
In the episode "Holy Matrimony!", James returned to his home as a result of a trap by his parents, who pretended to be dead. He was reunited with his old pet Growlie and managed to avoid marrying Jessiebelle. Growlie stayed behind when James returned to Jessie and Meowth.
James has a tendency to be swindled by a Magikarp Salesman, who has on many occasions tricked him into buying a Magikarp or other useless Pokémon and items for large sums of money.
James also has a tendency to cross-dress, but has not done it since "Pros and Con Artists". He does, however, dress up like famous celebrities as well, such as Professor Oak, Juan, and Norman.
James loves rare bottle caps and has an impressive collection of them. In the episode "All That Glitters!" it is revealed that he has "drunk enough soda pop to float an aircraft carrier".
For unknown reasons, he, Jessie and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation. However in newer episodes the balloon is shown with `jets` attached to explain how they get from one place to another faster than walking.</description>

<description>Butch is one half of of the Team Rocket duo that occasionally runs across Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokémon anime.
Butch`s partner is Cassidy, and she is one of the few that usually manages to get his name right- much to his frustration, everyone else calls him either "Biff", "Bill", "Bob", "Hutch", "Butcher", "Patch", "Botch" or "Chuck" (コサンジ Kosanji in Japanese). Sometimes when she gets it right, he, by habit, tries to correct her and ends up calling himself the incorrect name. Everyone getting his name wrong has become a running gag in the anime. This, of course, annoys him to no end. He once even said in frustration, "That does it, I am changing my name."
Butch is named after Butch Cassidy, an American outlaw. His Japanese name, Kosaburo, is meant to diminish his status when compared to James. 二郎 Jirou is a name meaning "second son," while 三郎 Saburou means "third son." Kojiro (James) takes advantage of Jirou, while Kosaburo takes advantage of Saburou.</description>

Cassidy and Jessie met either before or shortly after their both joining Team Rocket, and are assumed to have been rivals since then. The two women are almost equally vain. However, unlike Jessie, Cassidy keeps her cool easier and is much less prone to violent outbursts. Cassidy annoys Jessie to no end with her arrogance, and it appears that Cassidy likes instigating this frustration.
Cassidy is named after Butch Cassidy, an American outlaw. Her Japanese name, Yamato, is named after the 大和 Yamato, a World War II-era Japanese battleship. Its sister ship was the 武蔵 Musashi, one of Jessie`s namesakes.</description>

<description>Dr. Namba is a scientist of Team Rocket.
He first appeared in the Lugia saga that comprised of "The Mystery is History", "A Parent Trapped" and "A Promise is a Promise". He has since appeared in number of episodes giving Butch and Cassidy their mission briefings, though this was only as a vocal role in all except "Oaknapped". He is believed to be in his 50s or 60s. His name is often mispronounced, and he has a short temper.
Little is known about Namba. It can be speculated that since he does order scientists and agents within Team Rocket, he is either very knowledgeable about his field or that he has been with the group for a while, climbing the corporate ladder at Team Rocket. Also, in the Japanese version of his appearances on Pokémon Chronicles, Namba demands Butch and Cassidy to capture rare Pokémon for something he calls the `R Project.`
Aside from the already mentioned fact of him ordering a cadre of scientists and agents, two notable agents that he orders are Butch and Cassidy.</description>

<description>Lt. Surge is the Gym Leader of Vermilion City`s Gym, known officially as the Vermilion Gym. He hands out the Thunder Badge to Trainers who defeat him. He specializes in Electric-type Pokémon.
Lt. Surge made his only anime appearance in "Electric Shock Showdown", and in flashback appearances focused on Ash`s Pikachu.
Lt. Surge is an extremely large and muscular man, and seems to be the show`s tallest human character. He is arrogant, loud, and crude, and refers to all trainers as "babies" until they manage to defeat him. Lt. Surge generally looks down on unevolved Pokémon, preferring to evolve them as soon as possible.
His Raichu shares many of his personality traits, also appearing to be rather tough. Lt. Surge`s fatal weakness was that he evolved his Pokémon too quickly without taking the time to teach them the proper attacks. Even though he managed to defeat Ash and his Pikachu once with pure power, Pikachu was able to use speed-altering moves like Agility to get the best of Raichu.
In the anime, the Vermilion Gym appears to be a warehouse decorated with stylized lighting bolts.</description>

<description>Cyrus is Team Galactic`s leader.
Cyrus disregards all emotions, thinking of them as products of a weak human heart. His goal is to remake the universe in his own image, with himself as the god. He was born and raised in Sunyshore City, as noted in Diamond and Pearl by an elderly couple residing there. When Cyrus was young, he was a very good student; however, he was antisocial, preferring the company of machines over humans.
He made his first appearance in DP096 and DP097, along with Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. It was revealed that he is a rich businessman who has made most of the buildings in the Sinnoh region. However, Ash and the others do not know that he is also the Team Galactic leader. Using his businessman alter-ego, he visits the Celestic Town museum while the remaining members of Team Galactic carry out a plan to steal the Lustrous Orb and the Adamant Orb from the museum.
He discovers from Ash and Dawn that they have seen Azelf and Mesprit when the two tell of their encounters with the mysterious Pokémon at Lake Verity and Lake Valor. This apparently intrigues him, indicating that he will have future, possibly not as friendly, encounters with the group.</description>

After the portal to the new world opened, even though she wanted to enter it with Cyrus, she was stopped when she received a negative response, because he didn`t deem her and the other Team Galactic members worthy enough of the world he wanted to create. Despite that, when Cyrus went through the rapidly closing portal, she still tried to follow him, but her move was halted by Saturn. She was then shown to be devastated at losing her boss, who vanished into the new universe.

Saturn made his first appearance at the ending of "A Secret Sphere of Influence!", though it was a brief appearance at the end of the episode. He, along with the other Team Galactic Grunts, commented that Jessie, James and Meowth did a lousy job at stealing the Adamant Orb for them, and framing Nando for the crime.
Saturn later reappeared in "Journey to the Unown!", along with his Bronzor. He managed to steal a cube that was under the guard of the Unown of the Solaceon Ruins and brought it with him back to the Team Galactic HQ.
Saturn appeared again in "Enter Galactic!", with the cube he obtained in "Journey to the Unown!", which he exposed to the meteorites in Veilstone City, transforming it into the Spear Key.

<description>The Beginning
Ash is the main character of the Pokémon anime. Raised in Pallet Town, he started his journey to become a Pokémon Master at the age of 10. On the day that he started his journey, Ash carelessly woke up late despite being told by his mother, Delia Ketchum to get to bed. He rushed to Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory only to find out that the beginner Pokémon - Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander - had already been given out to trainers who arrived on time. However, Professor Samual Oak mentioned that there was one more Pokémon available - Pikachu. Despite constantly hitting Ash with Electric-type attacks and refusing to return to its PokéBall, Ash decided to take Pikachu along with him on his journey to become a Pokémon Master. Pikachu is cold towards Ash at first and laughs at his failures; however, when Ash saves Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow, he begins to warm up to his new trainer and the two finally become friends. After the battle with the flock of Spearow, a Ho-Oh is seen flying towards a rainbow in the sky. The PokéDex reveals that the Ho-Oh is an unidentified Pokémon. Thus, the journey of Ash and Pikachu begins.
Captures in Viridian Forest
While making his way towards Pewter City and his first Kanto League Gym Battle, Ash came upon a wild Caterpie deep within Viridian Forest. Instead of using Pikachu to battle against the wild Pokémon, Ash took his chances and threw a PokéBall without weakining the Caterpie first. Luckily, he was able to catch the Pokémon without any trouble. The capture of Ash`s Caterpie marked Ash`s first capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Caterpie the second Pokémon to join his team.
The next day, while continuing the trek through the Viridian Forest, Ash came up on a wild Pidgeotto. He tried to just throw a PokéBall like he did with Ash`s Caterpie, but Pidgeotto swatted the PokéBall away. Misty informed that he must weaken the Pokémon first before attempting to capture it. He called out Ash`s Caterpie to battle against, but Misty quickly informed him that Bug-type Pokémon are weak against Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeotto. After Pidgeotto dealt significant damage to Ash`s Caterpie, Ash recalled it and sent out Pikachu. Pikachu was able to use its Thundershock to weaken Pidgeotto and allow Ash to capture it with a PokéBall. Thus, this capture marked Ash`s second capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Pidgeotto the third Pokémon to join his team.
Later on, while still in the Viridian Forest, Ash was approached by Team Rocket, who attempted to steal his Pokémon. After defeating Meowth, James`s Koffing, and Jessie`s Ekans, Ash`s Caterpie evolved into Ash`s Metapod.
Some of Ash`s greatest accomplishments have been at the various Pokémon Leagues. He was the victor at the Orange League and the Battle Frontier. He also competed in the Indigo League and the Johto Silver Conference where he placed admirably in both those competitions as well.
Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup
Ash participated in the Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup at the Kagome Town stadium. In the first round he was in the fifth match and faced off against Marris. The match was quickly showcased and Ash won the battle and advanced to the second round while Marris was eliminated from the tournament.
The Isshu League
Ash participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where he was matched up against Trip. Trip`s Serperior was sent out to battle Pikachu and Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior`s speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter Trip`s Serperior speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round. The two met in the Pokémon Center after the battle, and Trip vowed that the next time they met that he would win. The two shook hands and parted ways.
In the first main round, Ash`s opponent was shown on the match up electronic board but not much else is known about the battle. Ash`s Scraggy participated in the second main round of the Isshu League tournament where it faced off against a Darumakka. It was able to defeat it so that moved on to the next round.
In the third round, Stephan was matched up against Ash. Cilan noted that the two of them have a very direct taste and that it would be a good battle. It was only a 3 on 3 battle but the both of them gave it their all. The first two battles of the third round setup the final match up of Stephan`s Sawk vs Ash`s Krookodile, both of which were very injured from the previous battles. Both of them did their best to muster up their reserve strength but in the end a surprise move of Aerial Ace by Ash`s Krookodile was super effective against Stephan`s Sawk and it knocked it out to give Ash the victory while eliminating Stephan from the tournament. Stephan realized after the battle that the reason that Ash withdrew Waruvial after the first battle was because Ash knew that Stephan would definitely send out Dageki, so he didn`t reveal that it knew Aerial Ace and saved until the end.</description>

<description>The Beginning
On the morning that Ash was to start his Pokémon journey, he woke up late and by the time he reached Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory, all of the beginner Pokémon were already taken. However, Professor Samual Oak did have one Pokémon left, a wild Pikachu. At first, Pikachu did not like Ash and would refuse to enter his PokéBall. He would often laugh at Ash`s failures and refused to listen to him. However, after Ash proved his loyalty to Pikachu by protecting him from a flock of Spearow, and thus began to earn Pikachu`s trust and respect. The two have since become best friends and Pikachu never leaves Ash`s side.
Since the day Team Rocket first encountered Pikachu, it has been their sole goal to capture it. Day after day, their plan to capture Pikachu has been thwarted mainly due to Pikachu`s amazingly powerful Thunderbolt that keeps on blasting them off.
On numerous occasions, Pikachu has made it evident that he is happy being a Pikachu and has no desire to evolve into a more powerful Raichu. It has proven time and time again that it is a powerful and worthy opponent to any Pokémon that dares to battle it.
Gym Battle against Burgh`s Leavanny
Pikachu was then sent out to battle Burgh`s Leavanny. Burgh`s Leavanny managed to tie up Pikachu with String Shot but unlike Ash`s Swadloon who was able to break free, Pikachu ended up getting hit with a couple of Leaf Storm attacks and a Hyper Beam before it rolled into another of Burgh`s Leavanny`s Leaf Storm attacks to break the string off its body so it could attack. Freed from the String Shot, Burgh`s Leavanny tried to tie it up again but Pikachu managed to avoid it with its speed and then knocked Burgh`s Leavanny out with a combination of Iron Tail and Electro Ball.
Gym Battle against Elesa
Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy and was then matched up with Pikachu. Pikachu made quick work of Elesa`s Emolga and knocked it out with one attack, its Iron Tail.
Elesa`s Tynamo was the last Pokémon that she used in her gym battle against Ash. It was matched up against Pikachu who had just defeated her Emonga. Pikachu had a hard time defending against the fast Tackle attack that Elesa`s Tynamo kept hitting it with but Pikachu used its Thunderbolt to create a large dust cloud leaving only a small corridor for Pikachu to focus on it and so Elesa`s Tynamo couldn`t maneuver out of the way. Pikachu one hit K.O`d Elesa`s Tynamo with a Iron Tail. The loss gave Ash the overall victory.
Battle against Alder`s Bouffalant
Ash challenged Alder to a battle and he accepted though he had been walking all night and was actually quite tired. Alder sent out his Buffron to battle Pikachu but just as the battle started, Alder fell asleep standing up and didn`t give any orders to his Buffron. Alder`s Bouffalant stood still as Pikachu began hitting it with attack after attack until it Alder`s Bouffalant finally got mad at Alder and charged at him and set him flying into a tree. After that, Alder`s Bouffalant no longer wished to battle and Alder conceded the battle.
Gym Battle against Skyla
In Skyla air battle simulation, Ash`s Tranquill was matched up against Skyla`s Unfezant and since her Pokémon was the highest evolved form, she determined that her Pokémon would be the winner in that match-up. In the actual gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was up against Skyla`s Unfezant which was the match-up just after Ash`s Tranquill had defeated Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla`s Unfezant proved to be stronger and faster than Ash`s Tranquill, so Ash recalled it and set out Pikachu. Pikachu had a definite advantage over Skyla`s Unfezant with its electric attacks and it quickly knocked it out with its Electro Ball attack.
Ash Just after Pikachu ended up knocking out Skyla`s Unfezant, Skyla`s Swanna was sent out to battle against it. Skyla had been watching her grandpa`s battle videos and noticed that he used the move Aqua Ring to defend against Electric attacks. She used that same defense against Pikachu which nullified its Electric attacks. It`s Iron Tail also couldn`t hit it so high in the air. Ash then noticed the rings in the air and Pikachu jumped up on them and managed to hit Skyla`s Swanna but not directly. Pikachu was now up in the air though and Skyla`s Swanna had the advantage there and it quickly knocked Pikachu out with a powerful Brave Bird attack.
Battle Against Trip`s Serperior at the Isshu League
Pikachu participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where it is was matched up against Trip`s Serperior. Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter its speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round.</description>

<description>While Wobbuffet is technically Jessie`s Pokémon, it has been around so long that it has become a main character, appearing in almost every episode of the series since it debut.
Wobbuffet was first seen walking around with Benny, his previous trainer. Jessie traded her Lickitung for Wobbuffet and it has been with her ever since that day.
Wobbuffet rarely battles but when he does, his Counter and Mirror Coat moves have proved to be very effective. Unfortunately, Jessie`s tactics aren`t always sufficient to master Wobbuffet`s superior defensive skills.
Wobbuffet also randomly comes out of his Pokeball, especially during the Team Rocket motto. He is also seen blasting off with Jessie regardless if he was actually part of the action.</description>

<description>Hikari is a 10-year-old Pokemon trainer and coordinator that travels with Ash Ketchum during Pokémon: Diamond &amp; Pearl. Following in her mother`s footsteps as a coordinator, she chooses a Piplup, which she had already befriended at an earlier point, and sets out with the goal of winning the Grand Festival. After meeting Ash and Brock, she becomes rivals with another coordinator, Zoey, as well as her childhood friend, Kenny and goes on to win the Floaroma Ribbon, the Wallace Cup`s Aqua Ribbon, the Celestic Ribbon and the Chocovine Town Ribbon. Before entering her third contest, Dawn was very confident in herself, training with her Pokémon before every contest.

<description>He is a Pokémon researcher that was once a competitive Trainer, and is generally considered the best in his field. As such, his role in the Pokémon games and anime is that of a mentor to young Pokémon Trainers, a source of information and an occasional plot device. Amongst other things, he is credited with inventing the Pokédex. He also hands out a Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander to beginning trainers (depending on which Pokémon the trainer chooses) to start their adventure in the Kanto Region. Although he is an expert on all matters relating to Pokémon, Professor Oak specializes in Pokémon behavioural science. He appears in Pokémon 4Ever as a child who was pulled into the future by Celebi. Additionally, it is apparent after Pokémon 3: The Movie that he knew Delia Ketchum since she was a child; this most likely is the reason he occasionally exhibits parental-type concern (mainly in the form of scolding Ash as he is doing something that is dangerous). He also creates poems centred around Pokémon and is known as the rhyming professor by Dawn.</description>

<description>Kanto Pokémon League Tournament:
With 10 Gym Badges, Gary Oak took his confidence and slight arogance from his Pokémon journey so far into the Kanto Pokémon League and continued to torment Ash who had also made it into the Kanto Pokémon League.
Gary`s first battle was on the ice field which he won easily, keeping all of his Pokémon from being KO`ed in the process.
Round 4 - Grass Field - Vs Melissa.
It down to the last Pokémon of both Gary and Melissa to see whom would proceed to the final 16 of the Kanto Pokémon League.
Towards the end of the battle Gary`s Nidoking faced off against Melissa`s Golem and both Pokémon looked tired. Gary ordered his Nidoking to use a Horn Attack, but Golem anticipated the move and managed to grab onto the horn and maintained a firm grip on it. In the final move of the round Golem used Seismic Toss on Nidoking, smashing it into the rock arena. When the dust settled Nidoking had been eliminated and Gary had been knocked out of the tournament.
Gary fell to his knees from the shock of the defeat and did not decide to stay to the end of the tournament, instead he left the Indigo Plateau with his distraught cheerleaders.</description>

<description>Caught by Ash.
Kanto Pokémon League Tournament
Round 4 - Vs Ash Ketchum - Grass Field
Despite looking like a weak opponent Jeanette`s Bellsprout managed to KO both Ash`s Bulbasaur and his Pikachu. Ash turned to Muk who he transferred from Prof. Oak just before the battle.
Due to Muk`s slow speed and bigger size it could not avoid Bellsprouts attack but thanks to its slimy and elastic body it was simply able to absorb them and not feel any damage. Bellsprout continued to launch a number of ounches, kicks and throws but still Muk absorbed them all. After repelling a Razor Leaf attack Muk smothered Bellsprout with its body and after a few seconds of struggling Bellsprout was defeated, giving Ash the victory and earned him a place in the final 16.
Please with its victory it gave Ash a hug which forced Ash to the ground. Ash laughed and praised Muk for giving him the victory.</description>

<description>Kanto Pokémon League Tournament
Round 4 - Vs Jeanette Fisher - Grass Field
Ash selected Bulbasaur as his first Pokémon whilst Jeanette choose her Beedrill. As the faster Pokémon, Beedrill charged at bulbasaur at full speed, however Bulbasaur mananged to evade and return a Razor Leaf attack. Once again Beedrill used its superior speed, avoiding the Razor Leaf attack whilst also getting itself in a good position to use a Twin Needle atttack on Bulbasaur. Despite being on the backfoot, Bulbasaur managed to dodge the Twin Needle attack and Beedrill`s Stinger. After jumping backwards, Bulbasaur created enough space to be able to use its Leech Seed attack which struck Beedrill on its attacking stinger. Beedril was stuck in Leech Seed forcing it to the floor and Ash had bulbasaur finish it off using a Tackle attack which gave Ash the Initial Advantage in the battle.
Like Beedrill, Scyther had an advantage in speed and used this by quickly trying to attack Bulbasaur with its blades. After beeing unsuccessful, Jeanette order Scyther to used a Swift attack which managed to hit Bulbasaur a few times and was useful in deflecting its Vine Whip attack. Jeanette ordered Scyther to use a Double Team attack to which Ash had Bulbasaur to attempt to hit the real Scyther. The attempt failed and Scyther was able to land a few strikes by charging at Bulbasaur and managed to evade Bulbasaur`s counter of a Razor Leaf and Vine Whip attack. Ash had Bulbasaur use its Vine Whip once more but told it to swing the vines towards all of the copies which Double Team created, knowing that Bulbasaur would have to hit the real one in the process. The plan worked and Scyther was struck by Vine Whip, eliminating it from the battle.
Jeanette released her final Pokémon of the round which was a Bellsprout. Her choice suprised her a few people including Bulbasaur, as by apperance alone Bellsprout could be considered a weak Pokémon.
Ash had Bulbasaur charge at Bellsprout but managed to flip it above its head using its own momentum against itself. Ash was stunned by Bellsprout`s agility. Bulbasaur was angered at being tossed aside so easily and charged once again at Bellsprout, but like before, was thrown away using its own momentum. Bellsprout took advantage of Bulbasaur being on the floor and thrown it towards Ash`s podium, showing great strength and eliminated Bulbasaur from the tie.
Ash quickly rushed Pikachu into battle to try and finish Bellsprout off.
Orange League Final - Vs. Ash Ketchum (Sand Field)
Bulbasaur was Ash`s fifth choice Pokémon in his winner`s trophy battle against Drake. Bulbasaur`s first opponent was against Drake`s Electabuzz.
Bulbasuar manage to shake of Electabuzz`s initial Thundershock attack and returned a Razor Leaf attack which struck Electabuzz, although, whilst being hit by Razor Leaf, Electabuzz manage to use a Thunderbolt attack that Bulbasaur quickly dodged.
Bulbasaur uses Tackle and causes some light damage to Electabuzz but taking advantage of how close Bulbasur was, it manage to hit Bulbasaur with a Thunderpunch which eliminated it.
After Ash had won the battle against Drake he called out all of his Pokémon that participated in the battle on the stage as Drake presented him with the Winner`s Trophy. Then Ash, Pikachu, Tauros, Lapras, Squirtle, Bulbasaur and Charizard all had their handprints set in stone to be remembered in the Orange Island Hall of Fame.</description>

<description>Chansey enrolled at a school that was designed specifically for Chansey. It struggled at first but managed to befriend a Jessie who was taking the same course despite being a human. Jessie helped Chansey in its study and started to do well on the course unlike Jessie who could not stay awake during the Chansey`s Sing ability, which was used to lull restless Pokémon to sleep.
Just before Jessie left the college, the Chansey that she made friends with, which had just graduated managed to catch up with Jessie and tried to persuade her to finish the course. Jessie explained that she would not be able to finish the course and so Chansey snapped its graduation medal in half and get one half to Jessie as a token of their friendship.
During the next few years Chansey evolved into a Blissey and manage to land a nursing position in a Pokémon Centre in Happy Town in the Johto region despite remaining slightly clumsey and over-eager to help at times. Some time later it was reunited with Jessie when they met in a Pokémon Centre in Johto. Blissey tried helping Jessie by giving her the food that was stored in the Pokémon Centre.
Blissey was caught on the Pokémon security cameras taking food from the Pokémon Centre`s storeroom and faced losing its position as a nurse.
Jessie did not want Blissey to lose its dream job which it worked hard for so James, Meowth and herself claimed they tricked Blissey into giving the food away and even attacked Blissey to make it look convincing.
Ash Ketchum made Jessie, James and Meowth blast off but not before Jessie ensured the events at the Pokémon centre will be kept a secret. Blissey and Jessie kept their pieces of the graduation medal and remained friends.

Nurse Joy`s Blissey are also great companions to the Joy`s in the Alola region. They sense sadness with its fluffy coat of fur. If it does so, this Pokémon will rush over to a sad person, no matter how far away, to share a Lucky Egg that brings a smile to any face.</description>

<description>Jasmine is the Gym Leader of the Olivine Gym and she also runs the Glitter Lighthouse in Olivine City where her Ampharos is stationed. She first met Ash and his friends at the lighthouse when her Ampharos was sick. Ash went and got some medicine for it.
At a later time, Ash challenged Jasmine for a gym badge. Ash`s Pikachu and Cyndaquil battled against her and proved to be a sufficient combo in order to defeat her and obtain the Mineral Badge.
Jasmine met up with Ash and Brock in Sunyshore City in the Sinnoh region. She met Dawn and the Sinnoh Elite Four member Flint. She challenged him to a battle with her Steelix but Flint used his Infernape which had a significant type advantage as well as being his most powerful Pokémon. Jasmine was easily defeated by Flint.</description>

<description>Solana is a Pokémon Ranger who has climbed up the ranks and is now a rank 10 ranger. She likes to have information on the Pokémon she is helping and is often seen with her Plusle riding on her shoulder.
Ash and his friends first encountered Solana in the Kanto region as she was investigating the strange growth of some vines in a forest. It ended up that Celebi was there and with Ash`s help they were able to care for the injured Celebi. She once again met up with Ash and friends when she was sent to investigate geomagnetic interference. Upon further investigation it was discovered that Deoxys was in the vicinity and had crashed on the planet in a meteor impact a few years earlier. After befriending Max, Deoxys decided that it wanted to explore more of the world and Solana was able to report back to the Ranger Union that the mission was completed.
While in the Sinnoh region, Ash encountered a rare Riolu that knew how to use Aura Sphere. It had been kidnapped from the Lucario Kingdom. Kellyn and Solana, where sent to track it down and with the strong bond Riolu made with Ash, the Riolu was returned back home.
It is said that when at first she met Kellyn in the Sinnoh region, she was jealous of his popularity with the girls because of his ranking and of his looks. She then heard that he didn`t ever notice the girls, and was assigned to work with her. At first, she barley talked to him, she found a liking of him when she saw how good and humble he was when they succeeded.</description>

He told Ash in advance that he would be using Registeel for the battle. In their first normal Frontier challenge battle, Brandon defeated Ash with his Registeel even though Ash`s Torkoal battle well. Brandon once again agreed to battle Ash but he first had to go in search of a rare Pokémon.
In his final battle against Ash, he decided to have a 4-on-4 battle instead of the 1-on-1 battles they had in the previous fights. Brandon used his Dusclops, Ninjask, Solrock, and Regice which Ash managed to defeat with his Charizard, Bulbasaur, Squirtle and Pikachu. Brandon was impressed with how well Ash had trained his Pokémon as well has how mature a battler he had become.
Brandon appeared with his Pyramid in the at Sinnoh region`s Snowpoint Temple where he once again met up with Ash. While there Paul showed up and it was revealed that Paul`s brother Reggie had once battled against Brandon for the Battle Frontier Brave Symbol and lost. Paul challenged Brandon and lost in a 6-on-6 full battle.
Brandon encountered a Regigigas at the Snowpoint Temple after Pokémon Hunter J attempted to revive and capture it. With Brandon`s help, and help from Brandon`s Regi`s, Regigigas was returned to the temple and Brandon promised to watch over the temple.</description>

<description>When Ash and co. were traveling towards Daybreak Town for Dawn`s next Pokémon Contest, a mysterious Pokémon Trainer specializing in martial arts, named Clayton, challenged Ash and his Buizel to a battle after seeing how Buizel saved Gible who had fallen into a river. Clayton`s Mr. Mime proved to be a really strong opponent, though, as it managed to dodge Buizel`s Aqua Jet and SonicBoom attacks by skillfully using its Psychic and Double Team moves, eventually knocking Buizel out with a powerful ThunderPunch. Ash and Buizel, determined to make up for the loss by getting stronger, started training with Clayton`s help so that Buizel could learn a new move; Ice Punch. He told them that, in order to master the move, they had to work on improving their speed and concentration.
At first, the progress of Ash`s Buizel`s training seemed to be really slow. However, after training overnight using unstable and light objects as targets for its punches, like floating leaves, Buizel managed to master the move completely. After the completion of Buizel`s training, Ash challenged Clayton to a rematch, and Clayton accepted. Ash`s Buizel proved to be more of a challenge for its opponent, Mr. Mime, this time and after activating its ability, Swift Swim, in the midst of the battle due to a sudden rain, Buizel managed to increase its speed and finish Clayton`s Mr. Mime off with a powerful Ice Punch. Clayton then acknowledged Ash`s Buizel`s improvement and praised its skills, but also put emphasis on the fact that Buizel still had a long way to go and had to keep on training.</description>

<description>Paul is a rival of Ash in the Sinnoh region. He has a very closed personality and doesn`t make friends very easily. He strives to find the strongest Pokémon he can possibly find and if they don`t meet his expectations he releases them.
He faced Ash in a full battle and managed to defeat him by using some of his older Pokémon where as Ash only used Pokémon that he had caught in the Sinnoh region save only Pikachu. The two of them made a pact to have a rematch at the Sinnoh League.
The two faced off in the quarter-final round of the Sinnoh League. Ash took the early lead by defeating Paul`s Aggron and Gastrodon. Paul fought back though defeating Buoysel, Staraptor and Torterra in a row. Infernape proved to be a powerful opponent and was able to defeat Paul. A bond between Ash and Paul was formed as they both began to respect each other after the battle.
After loosing to Ash in the Sinnoh League, Paul returned home and then challenged Brandon of the Battle Frontier.</description>

While Nozomi was young and attending the Kissaki City Trainers` School, she found an abandoned Nyarmar in a box in an alley. Nozomi kept the Nyarmar in the schools shed where it was also cared for by Suzuna. Teacher Ooishi found out about it pretty quickly but relented and allowed Suzuna and Nozocchi to take care of Nyarmar.</description>

<description>Rosebay is a Pokémon ornithologist. When Ash and his friends encounter her, she is in the process of observing the bird Pokémon in a forest between Jubilife and Oreburgh. She allows them to join her for a while, and shows them a Swablu nest in a nearby tree. Dawn notes the lack of any actual Swablu nearby, and Rosebay says the number of bird Pokémon in the forest has recently dropped very significantly, though she has no idea why.
Using her binoculars, she`s able to ascertain that the bird Pokémon seem to disappear as they fly through a nearby valley. Along with Ash and the others, she heads there to investigate, and notices a giant trap set up by Team Rocket to catch the birds as they fly through. After the trap has been destroyed, the captive birds freed, and Team Rocket sent blasting off, she bids the group farewell.</description>

<description>It`s not made clear exactly when Paul caught his Azumarill, or even if he caught it in that form, but Ash and his friends first see it during Paul`s battle with Roark, the Gym Leader of Oreburgh City.
Azumarill is first Pokémon Paul sends out in this battle, to counter Roark`s Geodude, but Geodude`s Hidden Power managed to deflect Azumarill`s Hydro Pump, and its following Rollout attack knocked Paul`s Pokémon out in one hit before it could get off another attack.
Later that day, Paul gave Azumarill to a kid at the Pokémon Center, saying it was a lost cause.</description>

<description>Kenny is a Pokémon Coordinator and has known Dawn since they were young children. Like Dawn, he is also from Twinleaf Town. He is constantly teasing Dawn and calling her Dee Dee, Pikari (ピカリ), a nickname he came up with one day after she got shocked by the classes Plusle and Minun which caused her hair to go all frizzly and sparkle. "Pikapika" is an onomatopoeia for "sparkling" and she was given the nickname by him.
After obtaining the 5 required ribbons, he participated in the Sinnoh Grand Festival at the Lakeside Resort. Unfortunately he was unable to advance past the Appeal round as his Empoleon`s Luster Cannon proved to be too powerful for his Floatzel to defend.</description>

<description>Lucian is a member of the Sinnoh Elite Four. Lucian made his anime debut with his Girafarig on television using his Girafarig against a Trainer`s Scizor. Then he appeared at the same Pokémon Center that Ash, Brock and Dawn were at and was challenged to a battle by Dawn`s Buizel. Buizel quickly lost, due to it not obeying Dawn`s commands.
When Buizel was caged by Team Rocket, he helped it regain its confidence and it broke the cage. He then battled Team Rocket using Buizel for a brief moment. Lucian won the battle with Buizel and realizes it wants a rematch. This time, with Buizel listening to Dawn`s orders, Lucian interrupts the battle and says it`s better this time.</description>

<description>Kellyn is a Pokémon Ranger from the Fiore region but transferred to Almia when he was 10. From there, he went to the Almia ranger school.
Kellyn rarely likes to work with people and will only if he sees a connection between the person and the Pokémon he is saving or if he is forced to. Being known as the "Genius Ranger", he can operate as an operator, ranger and mechanic. He is a bit of a neat freak when it comes to his collection of items at home. His memory is vivid and strong, as he can recite all of Almia`s times in order.
When in Sinnoh, he and Solana were to find the a lost Riolu from the Lucario Kingdom. Kellyn went to find him, while Solana and Officer Jenny looked for Pokémon Hunter J. At first, Kellyn thought that having Ash and company would ruin the mission but after he saw their intentions, he let them travel with him. When Riolu was safely home, Kellyn supposedly went to the Hoenn region to work full time in stopping Kyogre and Groudon`s fighting from reoccurring.</description>

<description>Candice is the Gym Leader of the Snowpoint Gym.
Candice attended Zoey`s contest in Mecabbage Town, where she was joined by Ash, Dawn and Brock who were also there for the same reason. Her cheering encouraged Zoey to do her best in the last battle of the Mecabbage Town Pokémon Contest, where Zoey`s Glameow was facing a Shuckle with powerful defenses. After winning the battle and earning her fifth ribbon, Zoey thanked Candice for her encouragement. She later threw a big party to celebrate Zoey`s victory.
The day after the contest, Candice and Zoey helped Dawn to come up with a new contest combination that could be used as a finishing move for a double contest battle. She gave Dawn an idea on how to use her Mamoswine`s Ice Shard attack more effectively by demonstrating a beautiful Ice Shard and Razor Leaf combination using her Abomasnow.</description>

Disguised as a Team Galactic member, together with Team Rocket, he ambushed the grunts that were guarding the entrance to Spear Pillar. After assuming their places, he managed to establish a contact with champion Cynthia and let her know of Team Galactic`s actions. While waiting for her, he was able to discover who was the evil team`s boss when Cyrus arrived at the site along with the commanders. However, they immediately saw through their disguises and consequently, he and Team Rocket were taken prisoners. He was later rescued by Cynthia, and was left keeping watch over Jupiter and some of Team Galactic`s members that were kept captive, while she, along with Ash and his friends, followed Cyrus and the commanders to Spear Pillar.
After the evil team`s plan had been thwarted, it was shown that he wondered where Team Rocket left off to, as they had mysteriously disappeared.</description>

Konoha asked Mojumbo if she could help heal the tree which had been split in half by lightning. She instructed the Pokémon to use Focus Growth on the spot where the nutrients flow though the tree. After the tree was healed, Mojumbo agreed to help protect the forest with Konoha.</description>

<description>Sebastian is the butler in one of James`s many mansions that is located in a forest close to Daybreak Town. He was watching over James`s Growlithe, Growlie, when Ash and his friends stopped by there. He immediately recognised the treasure chest that they had come upon as one belonging to his master, and to prove it, he showed them the drawing of Growlie that was on it. After seeing the treasure chest, he concluded that James would be on his way there, which made him extremely happy and impatient at the same time. He invited Ash and his friends to the mansion and offered them some snacks and cakes in return for discovering his master`s lost object.
When Growlie blew James`s disguise, even though he was really happy to see his master back, he immediately turned on capturing him. He even ordered his Spinarak to use String Shot in order to tie him down, so that he could accomplish his mission, which was to return James to his parents. However, his Pokémon was completely overpowered by James`s Mime Jr. and the Teeter Dance attack caused him and Spinarak to become confused. This gave James the chance to use one of the mansion`s secret traps to keep him away for a short while.
He seems to be very loyal to Jessiebelle, but couldn`t tell Jessie apart from her, when she was disguised as James`s fiancée in one of Team Rocket`s efforts to retrieve James`s lost object. Even when trapped, he managed to contact her and she arrived at the mansion shortly after. He revealed the secret passageway his master used as an escape route to her and together, they started chasing after James. After Ash and Brock sealed the exit using some boulders, he offered to open the door by force for Jessiebelle. Due to his strength not being enough to knock down the boulders on the other side, she used her Vileplume`s Solarbeam attack to open the sealed exit.
Seeing as there was no other way to escape from Jessiebelle and his mischievous butler, James asked Ash to have his Pikachu use Thunderbolt on him, Jessie and Meowth. Ash agreed and thus, James managed to escape from Sebastian.</description>

<description>McCann is an old man who lives in a very windy and mountainous area near Daybreak Town. Ash and his friends first met him when they got lost in the woods and came upon the valley where McCann and his granddaughter were having a battle. He is an expert when it comes to midair Pokémon battles, and that`s why he`s called an Air Battle Master. However, he has retired and rarely battles anymore, apart from having practice battles with his granddaughter Maya from time to time. Even though many Pokémon trainers have asked him to either take them on as apprentices or, if that can`t be done, to at least train their Pokémon to become stronger in air battles, he has turned them all down, because he didn`t see any potential in the trainers` Pokémon.
He owns a Scizor which he has trained in order to take advantage of the wind currents when it battles. He used that Scizor against Ash`s Gliscor, when Ash asked the Air Battle Master to have a battle with him so that he could test his Gliscor`s strength. The battle ended in an absolute victory for Scizor due to it skillfully using the wind currents to dodge Gliscor`s attacks. After seeing that Gliscor was unable to land a single hit on Scizor, he advised Ash to practice on how to `read` the wind movements along with his Pokémon, so that it can become stronger.
He later accepted another battle challenge from Ash. Using his Scizor again, he battled against a stronger Gliscor, but still managed to win. He was amazed, though, by Gliscor`s overnight improvement, as well as its strong, newly-learned Giga Impact attack, and offered Ash to train his Pokémon. Ash accepted the offer after noticing his Gliscor`s will to become stronger, and thus left it in McCann`s care.</description>

Ash and his friends first saw it when it was battling against a Chimecho in a practice battle between McCann and his granddaughter. It later battled against Ash`s Gliscor and managed to avoid all of its opponent`s attacks by taking advantage of the wind, which led to its absolute victory over Gliscor. Scizor was used again by McCann in his rematch battle with Ash, but this time Gliscor proved to be a more challenging opponent with its newly-learned Giga Impact attack. Scizor, however, managed to pull a close win using its powerful Hyper Beam attack.</description>

<description>Rebecca`s Shuckle is the Pokémon that Zoey`s Glameow faced off against in the final battle of the Mecabbage Town Pokémon Contest. Zoey`s Glameow proved to be a fast opponent for it, as it dodged effectively Shuckle`s Constrict attack. However, its powerful defenses gave Glameow a hard time, as its Fury Swipes couldn`t damage it at all when it was hiding inside its shell. Eventually, after Shuckle`s defenses were penetrated by its opponent`s Shadow Claw, it was knocked out by Glameow`s Iron Tail attack, which earned Zoey the victory and her fifth ribbon.</description>

<description>Makina is a Pokémon Trainer that Ash and his friends met in a forest on route to the nearby the Lakeside Resort. She often tells people to call her by her nickname "Rissa" in the English dub. Her Ditto`s had wandered away from her and started causing trouble as they were transforming into Pikachu, Piplup and Gible which made those Pokémon angry and get into fights with the Ditto`s.
She is big fan of the Sinnoh Elite Four member Flint and she dresses up just like him. She also had a small crush on Brock as he helped her with her battling techniques, but that quickly ended when she saw him go after another girl that was walking by in the forest.
She also battled against Ash and copied his Pokémon in the battle, but his experience and the strength of his Pokémon proved to be too much for her and he was able to win easily.</description>

<description>Takuto`s Latios was sent out to battle Ash during the semi-final round of the Sinnoh League. Latios had never previously been sent out during any of Takuto`s battles in the Sinnoh League or during his Sinnoh gym matches as his Darkrai had never been defeated until Satoshi`s Sceptile defeated it. Ash`s Pikachu faced Latios and the two ended up knocking each other out at the same time.</description>

<description>Forest`s Rhyperior was revealed when Forest sent it out to battle against Nurse Joy to see if Forest was good enough to be the Gym Leader of the Pewter City Gym. Forest`s Rhyperior was up against Nurse Joy`s Latias in the battle but its strength and determination showed that is was trained well by Forest. It`s Dig/Megahorn combination proved to be very effective against Nurse Joy`s Latias but it still wasn`t enough to defeat it. Even though Forest`s Rhyperior lost the battle, Nurse Joy recognized that it was a close battle and she was satisfied with Forest`s ability as a Gym Leader as Forest`s Rhyperior really showcased that to her in the battle.</description>

<description>Shinko is a beginning trainer that was at Professor Rowan lab the day that Dawn went to visit him for the first time after competing in the Sinnoh Grand Festival. Shinko likes to take notes of everything so she doesn`t forget and can review and study at a later time.
While she was contemplating which Pokémon she wanted to pick as her first Pokémon, the Piplup and Chimchar began fighting and the window in Professor Rowan lab broke and the two Pokémon quickly jumped out through it. Professor Rowan and Dawn were outside when they heard Shinko scream. Shinko already knew who Dawn was as she had watched her at the Grand Festival. While traveling in the forest together to find the missing Pokémon, Shinko congratulated Dawn and told her that it was an honor to be able to talk to her as she thought Dawn was a great role model and had been studying her techniques.
Dawn and Shinko chased after the two escaped Pokémon and were cornered and captured by a group of Ariados. With the help of Dawn`s Quilava, they were able to rescue the Pokémon and return to the lab. The same events happened to Dawn when she was selecting her first Pokémon as well, so Dawn and Shinko share a common experience.
Professor Rowan asked Shinko when she returned to the lab after her ordeal in the forest if she had decided what Pokémon she wished to chose as her starter Pokémon. She explained to Professor Rowan that she wanted to wait a bit so she could learn a bit more about them before she made her final decision. Shinko became friends with Dawn after that day and was at the boat dock waving goodbye to Dawn who was off to the Houen region.</description>
