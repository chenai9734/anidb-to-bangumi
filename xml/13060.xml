<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>Kinomoto Sakura</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Sakura`s given name (桜) means "cherry blossom". Her surname, Kinomoto (木之本), literally means "the origin of wood".
At the start of the series, Sakura is 10 years old and living in a fictional town called Tomoeda in Japan, located not far from Tokyo. One day in early April, shortly after her birthday and only slightly into her fourth grade year at Tomoeda Elementary School, young Sakura stumbles across a mysterious old book called The Clow in her father`s study. Instantly upon touching the book, a confused Sakura mistakenly awakens one of the card`s guardians, Cerberus who was sleeping on the front cover where he was supposed to be guarding the Clow Cards: a deck of 52 magical cards with incredible powers. Upon emerging from the book, Cerberus admits to having let the cards slip away as he slumbered, and, realizing Sakura`s magical potential, cunningly tricks her into becoming the "Cardcaptor" and duty bound to collect all of the missing cards and return them to the book where they will then be under her control.</description>

<description>Syaoran is a distant relative of Clow Reed (on Clow`s mother`s side), the creator of the Clow Cards. As a member of the Li clan of sorcerers from Hong Kong, of which Clow`s mother was a member, Syaoran believes that he should be the one to inherit the Clow Cards, not Sakura Kinomoto. He first appears as an antagonist in the story, capturing a few cards for himself in the anime (though none in the manga). He acted cold and nonchalant to Sakura. He never even says her name until the third season. As the series progresses, and especially after Sakura is officially deemed the new master of the Cards, Syaoran drops his rivalistic attitude towards her and becomes her ally and friend, eventually falling in love with her. However, Sakura is completely oblivious to these feelings and thinks of him simply as a close friend.</description>

<description>Cerberus is the guardian of the mystical yet dangerous book of Clow cards. He is the guardian of the sun, one of the two duty bound to protect the powerful cards, and opposite of the lunar guardian, Yue. For several decades he was locked away in the book of the Clow, which held the cards upon the death of their previous master, Clow Reed, until a new master appeared to take hold of the cards and their guardians. Cerberus` character first appears at the beginning of the series when this new master, Sakura Kinomoto, releases him from the book. Once Cerberus is awakened (he was napping on the front cover) and released from the book he discovers the Clow cards have vanished, and appoints Sakura the title of Cardcaptor, and sends her off to retrieve the cards.</description>

<description>Tomoyo is Sakura`s best friend and her second cousin on her mother`s side. The daughter of the president of Daidouji Toy Company, Sonomi Daidouji, Tomoyo lives a life of wealth and is watched over by a team of female bodyguards.
When she learns of Sakura`s new role as a Cardcaptor, she insists that Sakura must wear "special clothes" and begins providing Sakura with the various costumes she wears during her captures as well as accompanying her on missions to record the events with her video camera. She has access to a variety of prototype technological gadgets from her mother`s company, and supplies Sakura and Cerberus with different communication devices throughout the series. She is depicted as being mature, kind-hearted, and intelligent, and regularly speaking using more formal verb conjugations and expressions than normally seen in elementary students. She is a talented singer, and is shown performing in various school events.</description>

<description>Yukito is the classmate and best friend of Sakura`s brother, Touya Kinomoto. Yukito`s nearly omnipresent smile is evidence of his kind and gentle nature. Yukito also loves food and has an enormous appetite.
Yukito is the false form of the Moon Guardian Yue. Although Yue knows everything about Yukito, Yukito is initially unaware of Yue`s presence. Once Yukito learns of his alter-ego`s existence, the two are able to communicate mentally. It is suggested that Yue is the reason for Yukito`s large appetite, as he is in a sense "eating for two."</description>

<name>Kinomoto Touya</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Touya is the older brother of Kinomoto Sakura. His birthday is on February 29th, which makes him a leap year baby, a person that can only "properly" celebrate their birthday once every four years. His blood type is O. He holds the belief that as Sakura`s older brother, he is the only person entitled to make fun of her, a belief that his best friend Tsukishiro Yukito refers to as a "sister complex." However, he is also protective and caring of her, which leads him to dislike Li Shaoran when he finds Shaoran cornering Sakura in the schoolyard. Though Shaoran and Sakura eventually stop fighting, Touya continues to dislike Shaoran when he becomes friends with Sakura.
He is often working, and a running gag in the series involves Sakura and Yukito running into him while he`s at work, which can happen virtually anywhere.
He is a perceptive young man and has had a vague idea as to what Sakura has been up to as a Cardcaptor, despite Sakura`s attempts to keep it a secret. Touya was born with some magical ability, allowing him to see ghosts (including the one of his late mother). His magical ability is also what helps him sense when Sakura is in danger or when she is doing other "magical" things.</description>

<name>Mizuki Kaho</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Mizuki Kaho is a shrine maiden and the daughter of the priest at the Tsukimine Shrine. She first appears in the series as a new substitute teacher at Tomoeda Elementary School for the math class of Sakura and Syaoran. While Sakura instantly likes the teacher and feels a connection with her, Syaoran is distrustful and believes she is up to no good.
When Sakura, Syaoran, Meiling, and Tomoyo are trapped by the Maze card, Kaho uses a mysterious bell to break through Maze`s walls allowing Sakura to capture it. After this incident, the readers learn that Sakura`s older brother Touya dated Kaho when she was his junior high school teacher and that they broke up when Kaho left to study in England. Before she left, she told them that when they met again, they would be in love with different people which he acknowledges is now true.
After meeting her, Cerberus incorrectly believes that Kaho is the false form of his fellow guardian Yue. Kaho`s role is to use the bell left at her family`s shrine to give Sakura another chance when she is unable to defeat Yue out of fear of hurting him. The bell changes Sakura`s staff into a new staff containing her own power of the stars and gives her the power to use the cards to defeat Yue. After fulfilling this duty, she returns to England. During the third season of the series, she is primarily "seen" through providing a steady, but oftentimes enigmatic exchange of letters with Sakura over the mysterious attacks. After Eriol Hiiragizawa reveals the truth behind the attacks, they learn that Kaho had met Eriol three years before Sakura discovered the Book of the Clow. As they leave for England, Kaho and Eriol confirm their feelings for one another and vow to remain together. Kaho is last seen in the second film expressing concern for Sakura and her friends due to the incidents with the final card.</description>

<name>Hiiragizawa Eriol</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Hiiragizawa Eriol is the principal antagonist in the second half of the series, commonly called the Master of the Clow arc. The reincarnation of http://anidb.net/ch9882 [Clow Reed], Eriol has both Clow`s memories and all of his magic power. He has a magical staff similar to Clow Reed`s, can control Clow`s creations http://anidb.net/ch9581 [Yue] and http://anidb.net/ch7239 [Cerberus], and has created his own similar pair of guardians: http://anidb.net/ch14581 [Ruby Moon] and http://anidb.net/ch14579 [Spinel Sun]. He moves from England to transfer to Tomoeda Elementary school after http://anidb.net/ch1283 [Kinomoto Sakura] passed the Last Judgement and became the official master of the cards. He is depicted as a quiet, mature boy while at school, though he also shows a mischievous side when he regularly joins classmate http://anidb.net/ch14585 [Yamazaki Takashi] in weaving complex lies about the history of objects, places, and events. While seeming a normal student to Sakura, Syaoran is suspicious of him. It is soon shown that Yue and Cerberus are able to detect his magical signature as being Clow`s, and Eriol must erase Yue`s memories after he is accidentally seen by him.
Eriol came to Japan in order to aid Sakura and force her to use her own magical powers to convert the Clow Cards into Sakura cards. This is necessary as the cards take their magical energy from their master, but until Sakura converted them, they could not use her magic and were slowly dying. The guardian Yue also was suffering the same fate, forcing Sakura`s brother to "feed" him all of his magical power to prevent Yue, and his false form Yukito, from dying.
Sakura does not become aware that Eriol is causing all of the magical disasters that are causing her to convert the cards until near the end of the series when Eriol reveals himself to her. He puts the city to sleep and challenges Sakura to convert the last two cards, the Dark and the Light, which must be converted together. He then takes Sakura, Syaoran, http://anidb.net/ch9580 [Tomoyo], Yue, and Cerberus to his home where he explains why he had to give her a reason to convert the cards, as her doing so without a need could have sent the cards out of control or drained Sakura`s own life.
Eriol`s true age is unknown, as he used his magic to halt his aging process to remain the same physical age as Sakura. He is romantically involved with http://anidb.net/ch14576 [Mizuki Kaho], whom he originally sent from England to aid Sakura in the Final Judgment and who offers Sakura support through letters during the second arc. In the second anime movie, they are shown together when Sakura calls for advice.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Spinel Sun is the cat-like magical guardian created by Eriol as a counter part to Clow Reed`s original guardian Cerberus. Spinel Sun`s true form is a winged black panther, while his false form is similar to a small winged cat. Nicknamed Suppi by Ruby Moon, Spinel Sun spends most of his time reading and projects a calm demeanor. Ruby Moon often teases him that he needs to have more fun. During the series, he mostly remains out of sight of the main characters, except when he once runs into Cerberus in his false form. Fortunately for him, Cerberus doesn`t suspect anything and instead declares him a monster and feeds him sweets, not realizing that the sweets would turn Spinel Sun into a hyperactive eating machine. Cerberus does not learn his true identity until just before the final battle where the two cats face one another. Initially, Spinel Sun appears to have the upper hand, however Cerberus` greater determination to protect Sakura enable him to defeat him.</description>

<description>Ruby Moon is one of two magical guardians created by Eriol. The counterpart to the original guardian Yue, Ruby Moon is genderless but prefers to act as a female. When Eriol transfers to Tomoeda Elementary, Ruby Moon created a false form named Akizuki Nakuru and enrolls in Seijou High School, entering the same class as Touya, Sakura`s brother, and Yukito, the false form of Yue who is unaware of his true nature. As Akizuki, she acts as a general annoyance, deliberately interfering every time Touya tries to talk to Yukito about the latter`s dwindling energy. She claims she wants to consume Touya`s energy herself, though it is never stated that she actually has a need for it nor why she couldn`t simply steal it. When Touya is finally able to speak with Yue and give him all of his magical energy to sustain Yue`s life, Akizuki gives up her pursuit. In the final battle, Ruby Moon battles Yue and initially appears to be winning. However, Yue is able to get past her due to his greater determination and desire to protect Sakura.</description>
