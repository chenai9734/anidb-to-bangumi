<name>kodomo</name>
<description>In the context of manga and associated media, the word kodomo refers to a children`s audience roughly for the ages 12 and younger. In Japanese, the word means simply "child", and has no anime/manga-related connotations at all. It does not comprise a style or a genre per se, but rather indicates the publisher`s intended target demographic.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Snorlax is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Munchlax when leveled up with high friendship. It also has a Gigantamax form.
In the Generation I and II games and their remakes, wild Snorlax can be found sleeping in inconvenient locations throughout Kanto. In order to catch one, a Trainer must first awaken it with music from either a Poké Flute or Pokégear set to the Poké Flute channel. A sleeping Snorlax makes a return in Pokémon X and Y, in which it is blocking the player`s way on Route 7.
Snorlax is a huge, bipedal, dark blue-green Pokémon with a cream-colored face, belly, and feet. Its body is composed of mostly its belly, as its limbs are comparatively small. Its head is large with small, pointed ears and two pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw. It has round feet, which both have three claws and a circular brown paw pad, and short arms with five claws on each hand. Snorlax`s bulk makes it the heaviest Normal type.
Snorlax is often found in mountains and forests. It wakes up only to eat, requiring 900 lbs. (400 kg) of food per day before returning to its slumber. It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it to eat even moldy food without feeling any ill effects. It can even handle thorny plants or Muk`s poison. It can also eat while it is resting. Snorlax is docile enough to let children and small Pokémon bounce on its large stomach.
Snorlax can show awesome power when prompted. As Gigantamax Snorlax, seeds and small rocks that were tangled in its belly fur goes through immense growth and a tree spouts upon its belly. The tree has three red clouds surrounding it like a circle. It almost never moves; even when in battle it only slightly lifts its body and attacks by flailing with its arms and legs. However, its attacks are very powerful — Gigantamax Snorlax is considered to be the strongest Dynamax Pokémon to have been discovered.
It is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Pulverizing Pancake and G-Max Move G-Max Replenish.</description>

<description>Meowth is a very unique Pokémon as it has many of the characteristics of a human. It walks on two feet, talks and is as smart as any human. Meowth is currently a member of Team Rocket and he travels around with Jessie and James trying to capture Pikachu and other rare Pokémon for Giovanni.
Meowth generally finishes his sentences with "Nyaa (ニャー)" which is the equivalent of "meow" in English. This helps people remember that despite his ability to talk like a human, he still has cat character traits.
Meowth is also known for coming up with his many schemes to try to capture Pikachu. While Jessie and James always agree with Meowth and think his plans are brilliant, they are generally foiled by Ash and his friends.
Long Con to Access Raimon City Pokémon Center
Meowth schemed with Jessie, James and Doctor Zager to figure out a way for them to infiltrate the Raimon City Pokémon Center where high-leveled Pokémon are stored in a vault that is protected by a security machine scan system that would only open if Nurse Joy (Isshu) or Nurse Joy`s Audino were scanned. Meowth pretended to be no longer part of Team Rocket making up a story that his made an error while executing a certain operation and when headquarters hear of his mistake, they told him he was fired.
Ash, Iris and Cilan believed him and allowed Meowth to travel with him. Pikachu though didn`t trust Meowth even though Meowth proved on numerous occasion that it should be trusted. Meowth`s plan was put into action when they arrived at the Raimon City Pokémon Center and as soon as Nurse Joy`s Audino was scanned to open the door, Meowth turned on Pikachu and the other and captured all the Pokémon in the vault. The long con had been a success and Meowth met up with Jessie and James below the Pokémon Center. Unfortunately, they weren`t able to get away as Ash and his friends realized that Meowth had just been conning them and they were able to stop Team Rocket.</description>

<description>The Beginning
On the morning that Ash was to start his Pokémon journey, he woke up late and by the time he reached Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory, all of the beginner Pokémon were already taken. However, Professor Samual Oak did have one Pokémon left, a wild Pikachu. At first, Pikachu did not like Ash and would refuse to enter his PokéBall. He would often laugh at Ash`s failures and refused to listen to him. However, after Ash proved his loyalty to Pikachu by protecting him from a flock of Spearow, and thus began to earn Pikachu`s trust and respect. The two have since become best friends and Pikachu never leaves Ash`s side.
Since the day Team Rocket first encountered Pikachu, it has been their sole goal to capture it. Day after day, their plan to capture Pikachu has been thwarted mainly due to Pikachu`s amazingly powerful Thunderbolt that keeps on blasting them off.
On numerous occasions, Pikachu has made it evident that he is happy being a Pikachu and has no desire to evolve into a more powerful Raichu. It has proven time and time again that it is a powerful and worthy opponent to any Pokémon that dares to battle it.
Gym Battle against Burgh`s Leavanny
Pikachu was then sent out to battle Burgh`s Leavanny. Burgh`s Leavanny managed to tie up Pikachu with String Shot but unlike Ash`s Swadloon who was able to break free, Pikachu ended up getting hit with a couple of Leaf Storm attacks and a Hyper Beam before it rolled into another of Burgh`s Leavanny`s Leaf Storm attacks to break the string off its body so it could attack. Freed from the String Shot, Burgh`s Leavanny tried to tie it up again but Pikachu managed to avoid it with its speed and then knocked Burgh`s Leavanny out with a combination of Iron Tail and Electro Ball.
Gym Battle against Elesa
Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy and was then matched up with Pikachu. Pikachu made quick work of Elesa`s Emolga and knocked it out with one attack, its Iron Tail.
Elesa`s Tynamo was the last Pokémon that she used in her gym battle against Ash. It was matched up against Pikachu who had just defeated her Emonga. Pikachu had a hard time defending against the fast Tackle attack that Elesa`s Tynamo kept hitting it with but Pikachu used its Thunderbolt to create a large dust cloud leaving only a small corridor for Pikachu to focus on it and so Elesa`s Tynamo couldn`t maneuver out of the way. Pikachu one hit K.O`d Elesa`s Tynamo with a Iron Tail. The loss gave Ash the overall victory.
Battle against Alder`s Bouffalant
Ash challenged Alder to a battle and he accepted though he had been walking all night and was actually quite tired. Alder sent out his Buffron to battle Pikachu but just as the battle started, Alder fell asleep standing up and didn`t give any orders to his Buffron. Alder`s Bouffalant stood still as Pikachu began hitting it with attack after attack until it Alder`s Bouffalant finally got mad at Alder and charged at him and set him flying into a tree. After that, Alder`s Bouffalant no longer wished to battle and Alder conceded the battle.
Gym Battle against Skyla
In Skyla air battle simulation, Ash`s Tranquill was matched up against Skyla`s Unfezant and since her Pokémon was the highest evolved form, she determined that her Pokémon would be the winner in that match-up. In the actual gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was up against Skyla`s Unfezant which was the match-up just after Ash`s Tranquill had defeated Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla`s Unfezant proved to be stronger and faster than Ash`s Tranquill, so Ash recalled it and set out Pikachu. Pikachu had a definite advantage over Skyla`s Unfezant with its electric attacks and it quickly knocked it out with its Electro Ball attack.
Ash Just after Pikachu ended up knocking out Skyla`s Unfezant, Skyla`s Swanna was sent out to battle against it. Skyla had been watching her grandpa`s battle videos and noticed that he used the move Aqua Ring to defend against Electric attacks. She used that same defense against Pikachu which nullified its Electric attacks. It`s Iron Tail also couldn`t hit it so high in the air. Ash then noticed the rings in the air and Pikachu jumped up on them and managed to hit Skyla`s Swanna but not directly. Pikachu was now up in the air though and Skyla`s Swanna had the advantage there and it quickly knocked Pikachu out with a powerful Brave Bird attack.
Battle Against Trip`s Serperior at the Isshu League
Pikachu participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where it is was matched up against Trip`s Serperior. Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter its speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round.</description>

<description>While Wobbuffet is technically Jessie`s Pokémon, it has been around so long that it has become a main character, appearing in almost every episode of the series since it debut.
Wobbuffet was first seen walking around with Benny, his previous trainer. Jessie traded her Lickitung for Wobbuffet and it has been with her ever since that day.
Wobbuffet rarely battles but when he does, his Counter and Mirror Coat moves have proved to be very effective. Unfortunately, Jessie`s tactics aren`t always sufficient to master Wobbuffet`s superior defensive skills.
Wobbuffet also randomly comes out of his Pokeball, especially during the Team Rocket motto. He is also seen blasting off with Jessie regardless if he was actually part of the action.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Ash first encountered Mijumaru at Professor Juniper laboratory as it was one of the Pokémon that Trip was to choose from. Ash called it cute when he first saw it which caused Mijumaru to blush a bit. After being shocked that it wasn`t chosen by Trip, it followed Ash and Pikachu as they started their journey in the Isshu region.
It rescued Pikachu and Iris`s Axew from Rocket Gang. Ash thanked it but quickly left it behind in the forest so that he could treat Pikachu. It continued following Ash until one day it met up again and tried to explain that it wanted to join Ash on his journey. Ash tried to capture it with one of his Poké balls but then realized it already had a Poké ball and that this Mijumaru must have been the same one that he met at Professor Juniper lab. He contacted Professor Juniper and she agreed to let him have the Mijumaru and transferred its Poké ball to him. By the time it had been transferred over, it had disappeared again.
Ash met up with Mijumaru once again when they were resting in the sands at Dan`s hotel. After protecting Ash from being scalded from a hot water geyser, Ash quickly recalled it into the Poké ball before it got scalded itself. Since then Ash`s Oshawott has had the tendency to come out of its Poké ball whenever it feels like despite what the current situation is.
Gym Battles against Lenora`s Watchog
During the first gym battle against Ash`s Oshawott, Lenora`s Watchog used Mean Look so Ash`s Oshawott couldn`t be switched out. Since Ash`s Oshawott wasn`t expecting to battle Lenora`s Watchog at that time, it was at a disadvantage and it was in a bad mood. After Ash`s Oshawott lost its shell during the battle, Lenora`s Watchog was able to use its Thunderbolt effectively to knock Ash`s Oshawott out of the match.
During the rematch battle against Lenora`s Watchog, Ash`s Oshawott had learned Aqua Jet during the time between the two battle and but its accuracy make it easy for Lenora`s Watchog to avoid it. Though through sheer luck, Ash`s Oshawott Aqua Jet managed to hit Lenora`s Watchog and both ended up getting knocked out at the same time as Lenora`s Watchog used Thunderbolt just before it got hit.
Three-on-Three Battle Against Trip`s Timburr
Ash`s Oshawott was paired up against Trip`s Timburr but the beginning of the battle didn`t go to well for Ash as Ash`s Oshawott had its eyes closed during Aqua Jet and completely missed hitting Trip`s Timburr. After a short break in the battle, the two finished up with their final attacks. Ash`s Oshawott`s Razor Shell proved to be stronger than Trip`s Timburr`s DynamicPunch and Ash`s Oshawott defeated Trip`s Timburr despite its initial problems with Aqua Jet`s accuracy.
Mastering Aqua Jet
While training in Don George`s pool for the battle against Lenora, Ash`s Oshawott learned Aqua Jet. It`s aim proved to be quite off but through sheer luck it was able to use Aqua Jet to knock out both Lenora`s Watchog and Stephan`s Blitzle. It wasn`t until Trip noticed by taking some pictures during his three-on-three battle with Ash that Ash`s Oshawott had its eyes closed during Aqua Jet. Ash vowed to help his Oshawott practice to keep its eyes open underwater so that its Aqua Jet`s targeting would be accurate.
While enroute to Raimon City, Ash, Iris and Cilan`s Pokémon all got poisoned and the only thing that could cure them was a waterweed plant found in a nearby lake. Ash`s Oshawott was training with Ash at the time and didn`t get poisoned and since it was a Water Pokémon, it was best suited for the job. Unfortunately Ash`s Oshawott still didn`t like to open its eyes underwater until it was forced to defend itself against a school of Tympole who were protecting their lake from trespassers. Ash`s Oshawott opened its eyes underwater to defend itself and it started to get comfortable doing so. Ash`s Oshawott was later forced to battle Palpitoad because it came out of the water to protect its lake. During the battle, Ash`s Oshawott managed to master its Aqua Jet as it was able to remember the battle against the Tympole school and how having its eyes opened underwater was quite effective and that proved to be the decisive factor in the battle as Palpitoad was knocked out and Ash caught it.
Battle against Bel`s Father`s Hihidaruma
Ash challenged Bianca`s Father to a Pokémon battle to allow Bianca to continue to travel. He agreed but changed the challenge to force Ash to return home to Pallet Town if he lost the battle. Ash`s Oshawott came out of its ball as it wanted to battle against Bianca`s Father`s Darmanitan and Ash thought that it would be okay because it had a type advantage being a water Pokémon. Even though Bianca`s Father`s Darmanitan only used Fire type moves throughout the battle, it proved to be too strong for Ash`s Oshawott. Ash`s Oshawott did manage to land an Aqua Jet. Bianca`s Father commented though that his Red Flash Hihidaruma gets more fired up the more resistance it faces and shortly after it knocked Ash`s Oshawott out. Despite loosing the battle, Bianca`s Father changed his mind because the battle with Ash and his Mijumaru made him remember the joy of traveling.
Battle Against Pod`s Baoppu
Initially, Ash was going to battle Chili`s Pansear with his Pikachu, but Ash`s Oshawott popped out and wanted to battle it instead. Ash agreed and despite the type disadvantage in this battle, Chili just got more fired up. Chili`s Pansear managed to cover its weakness with power and momentum and taking Cilan`s advice into account, it used Flame Charge to increase its speed to become useful when dodging Ash`s Oshawott moves. Chili`s Pansear managed to endure Ash`s Oshawott super effective moves just long enough for it to use its newly learned SolarBeam attack which Ash`s Oshawott was unable to dodge and it was knocked out. Chili`s Pansear won the battle despite the type disadvantage.
Battle Against Clay`s Krokorok
Clay`s Krokorok was the first Pokémon Clay used to battle against Ash during his gym battle. Clay`s Krokorok was paired up against Ash`s Oshawott as Pikachu initially wanted to battle it but Ash realized that an Electric type against a Ground type would be a bad idea.
At the beginning of the battle, Clay`s Krokorok had the upper hand as its Sandstorm managed to get sand in Ash`s Oshawott`s eyes and it also made it harder for Ash`s Oshawott to accurately attack. Clay`s Krokorok managed to hit Ash`s Oshawott with a Bite and a Stone Edge attack but it wasn`t enough to knock it out. Ash`s Oshawott used Water Gun to clear up the Sandstorm and then it began its counterattack. Clay`s Krokorok was repetitively hit with multiple attacks from Ash`s Oshawott including a super effective Aqua Jet and Razor Shell combo that ended up being too much for it and it was knocked out.
Battle Against Clay`s Palpitoad
Ash decided to keep his Oshawott out to battle against Clay`s Palpitoad and right away it became evident that Clay`s Palpitoad was the stronger Pokémon as its Hydro Pump ended up being more powerful than Ash`s Oshawott Water Gun. Clay`s Palpitoad followed up with a Sludge Bomb that knocked Ash`s Oshawott`s scallsword out of its hand and just as it was retrieving it, it got hit by Clay`s Palpitoad Rock Smash`s and was knocked out.
Ash`s Oshawott and Dawn`s Piplup Rivalry
Ash`s Oshawott and Dawn`s Piplup both fell in love with Meloetta and the two of them began a rivalry to win the affection of Meloetta. Ash`s Oshawott would often come out of its PokéBall when it could tell that Dawn`s Piplup was trying to take advantage of a situation. Even though the two of them often argued, they found a common ground and became friends after Meloetta left.</description>

<description>While on route to Shippo City, Ash encountered a resilient Tsutarja. Tsutarja started eating the cakes Dent made. Realizing that it was a strong and powerful Pokémon, he decided to try to capture it right away but it didn`t get captured in the monster ball. Ash then instructed Pikachu to attack Tsutarja but Ash ended up having to protect Pikachu from Tsutarja`s powerful vine whips as it was exposed to Attract which made it dizzy.
Ash`s Oshawott and Ash`s Tepig were both sent out to battle Tsutarja as well but it used Attract against them which proved quite effective due to the gender differences. Ash finally instructed his Mamepato to battle as it wasn`t affected by Attract. After a fierce battle between Tsutarja and Mamepato, Tsutarja was weakened enough and Ash captured it successfully.
Don George Tournament
Georgia faced Ash in the second round of the Don George tournament in Raimon Town. Georgia`s Pawniard faced Ash`s Snivy and at the beginning of the battle it looked like it was going to easily win but Ash`s Snivy was able to avoid getting hit by Guillotine. From that point on, Ash`s Snivy took control of the match and was able to defeat Georgia`s Pawniard which advanced Ash on to the next round in the tournament.
Gym Battle Against Elesa`s Emolga
After Elesa`s Emolga defeated Ash`s Palpitoad, Ash`s Snivy was sent out to battle against Elesa`s Emolga but Ash didn`t really have a battle strategy anymore since his Palpitoad had been defeated and he forgot that Emolga was also a Flying type. Elesa`s Emolga combination of Acrobatics and Aerial Ace was just too hard for Ash`s Snivy to defend against as the type advantage hampered it. Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy fairly easily.
Battle against Katharine`s Gothita
Katharine`s Gothita convinced Ash`s Scraggy to come with it outside to get something to eat. They ended up getting in trouble with a Garbodor and Katharine`s Deerling to use its Aromatherapy to calm down the raging Garbodor after Ash`s Snivy had followed them to see what they were up to. Katharine`s Gothita did not like the fact that Ash`s Snivy had been looking up on them and it decided it wanted to battle it.
Katharine`s Gothita was quite mad at Ash`s Snivy but it didn`t stand a chance against it in battle. Ash`s Snivy barely broke a sweat as it was able to counter and avoid all of Katharine`s Gothita`s attacks before it knocked it out with its Leaf Storm. Still upset, Katharine`s Gothita ran off into the distance.
Battle against Clay`s Palpitoad
After knocking out Ash`s Oshawott, Ash`s Snivy was sent out to replace it as Ash picked it because it was strong against both Ground and Water. Ash`s Snivy used Attract right at the beginning of their battle which prove to be an unexpected yet effective technique as Clay`s Palpitoad was unable to attack after the effects of Attract took hold of it. Ash`s Snivy pummeled Clay`s Palpitoad with effective Grass type attacks until it was knocked out.
Battle against Clay`s Excadrill
Ash kept his Snivy out to battle against Clay`s Excadrill but that matchup didn`t last long as Clay`s Excadrill was able to defend against all of Ash`s Snivy`s attacks. Ash`s Snivy was quickly knocked out with a strong Horn Drill.</description>

<description>Aria Forme
Meloetta is a small feminine humanoid Pokémon with long, green hair and is one of the few Pokémon to have alternate forms. Its default form is Aria Forme (Voice Forme), but it can also transform into Pirouette Forme (Step Forme), where its long green hair forms into a compact red beehive hairstyle and its body seems to take on more of a ballerina`s form. It changes forms whenever it uses its unique move Relic Song.
Meloetta once played a song and danced lightly, filling people`s hearts with joy. However, sorrow darkened the world, and it lost its voice and red shoes. Upon entering a café in Castelia City, a guitarist who knows the story plays Meloetta`s melody. Upon playing it, Meloetta remembers the song it once danced to long ago, and learns Relic Song.
Meloetta will appear in a short film that accompanies Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice in theaters, entitled Meloetta`s Sparkling Recital.
Another Meloetta is a main character in the Best Wishes! Season 2 anime, joining Ash, Iris, Cilan, Cynthia, and Dawn in their journeys through Eastern Unova.</description>
