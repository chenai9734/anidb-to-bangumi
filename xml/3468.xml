<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="430888">Greatest thing ever, if you haven`t seen this, you havent watched anime at all.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="430122">Don`t get me wrong, I absolutely hate shounen. Naruto, Bleach, One Piece are all absolute garbage to me, but something about this series makes it a great one. Perhaps it is the ability to separate itself from every shounen ever made? I think so.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="515855">Gintama is related to anime and japanese culture much the same way Family Guy is to american cartoons and (tv) culture. Think among the lines of Simpsons-&amp;gt;FG, One Piece-&amp;gt;Gintama.

You`ll need some weaboo/otaku backgrounds to really appreciate what`s being parodied at times, but even without that, plain good old dead-pan toilet humor is often enough to make up for it.

The only complain I have are sometimes stupid fillers whenever anime runs ahead of manga, but even those are quality at other times (leaning towards the slapstick/fourth-wall kind of thing).</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="560352">Fouth wall integrity: going.... going.... and gone!
Seriously though, incredibly funny and all around enjoyable anime. It`s also (due to its length), the proverbial "gift that keeps on giving".</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="69809">Intriguing characters, frequently nonsensical hysterics and oodles and oodles of lampooning. Recommended. By the way calling it the Seinfeld of anime is an insult to Gintama and all anime in general.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="325333">This is simply THE BEST ANIME EVER! My previous favourite anime don`t even come close to it. Godlike comedy/parody, great action and the balance between these two couldn`t be any better. Free storyline and unparalleled characters create such awesome situations. While watching this, I often felt like the author sees inside my head and is fulfilling my wishes into the anime. Really, no other word than PERECT comes to my mind. This is the reason why anime can be called an art form. This is a true masterpiece!</recommendation>

You`ll see all categories in this show, introduced in a decent and pleasant way, just complete the first 10 episodes, and then you can`t stop.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="29218">I have watched alot of different series and been both surprised and dissapointed. I found that i oreffered slapstick and made sure to at least give those a chance before writing them of. This series is the epitome of slapstick. Never have i seen a more perfect series for frankly any anime lover. This series is one of my great loves when it domes to anime (only possibly matched by FMP:Fumoffu!) and deserves your free time.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="536175">The best long-running series EVER!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="398315">One of the great comedy animes and perhaps the greatest parody comedy. Even if you generally dislike shounen (as I do), don`t let that label deter you -- the shounen atmosphere is only a backdrop for parody that ranges across all types of Japanese TV, film and culture. Ignore the outrageous negative hype -- this show is *not* just an endless series of mindless references to Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, etc. With that said, the show isn`t without its flaws, most notably the shift in emphasis from comedy to action in the later eps and occasional overuse of toilet humor throughout the series. But it`s still a "must-watch" anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="497690">I wont go on and tell u that this anime is great or not, you have to decide it for yourself. But I just want to tell that this show is like cocaine/weed, it is seriously ADDICTIVE, totally non-resistible once you like it. I considered myself Gintama`s biggest hooligan, not fan. Every episode I watched 3 times, some 10. I remember all the jokes. My point is that this series is seriously ADDICTIVE and it change you and your habit of watching anime completely. Before this I watched anime casually. After this I watch only the best the world has to offer, and mostly that consists of re-watching Gintama. Say goodbye to sissy moeblob shit if u decided to watch this, because afterwards, the whole anime landscape with you is filled with mostly shit. You become easily unsatisfied with anime. And before you know it, you will have a big gap in your heart waiting for the new episode of Gintama every week.</recommendation>

<name>detective</name>
<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.

<name>tsukkomi</name>
<description>A tsukkomi is a comedy duo stock character in a traditional Japanese slapstick stand-up comedy style known as manzai. Tsukkomi characters are the smart, reasonable, and down-to-earth half of the unit; their simple-minded counterparts are the http://anidb.net/t1399 [boke] characters. As a result of their boke counterparts` simple mistakes and gross exaggerations, tsukkomi berate and abuse them both verbally and physically; a very common example of tsukkomi physical abuse is a paper fan slap, which is generally accompanied by a sound effect. Their approximate equivalent in Western culture is the comedy role of straight man.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>medium awareness</name>
<description>Medium awareness is the situational and generally temporary awareness characters in works of fiction have and display of the very fact that they are characters in works of fiction. For example, they may comment about the background music, quip about the script or narration, complain about the roles given to them by the writer or their lack of screen time, see the subtitles that appear on screen, inform the audience about the arrival of the commercial break, and even use medium effects as tools. The most common form of medium awareness is known as breaking the fourth wall, in which characters speak directly to the audience, either to it as a whole or to specific members of it. The "fourth wall" is the imaginary "wall" at the front of the stage of a proscenium theatre through which the audience sees the play; it is a metaphor for the boundary between what happens inside the work, to the characters, and outside it, to the audience.</description>

<name>Bakumatsu - Meiji Period</name>
<description>"Bakumatsu" (幕末, "Late Tokugawa Shogunate") occurred between 1853 and 1867 during which Japan ended its isolationist foreign policy and modernized from a feudal shogunate to the Meiji government. Bakumatsu represents the final years of the Edo period (when the Tokugawa shogunate ended) and preceded the Meiji era. The primary historical significance of Bakumatsu was the conflict between the pro-imperialist "Ishin Shishi" ("nationalist patriots"), and the shogunate forces, including the elite Shinsengumi ("New Selected Corps").
The Meiji Era (including Meiji Restoration) denotes the 45-year reign of Emperor Meiji, running from 23 October 1868 to 30 July 1912. During this time, Japan started its modernization and rose to world power status.
Be aware that this category should only be assigned to anime that take place in Japan during the years mentioned above, and not to every anime that has samurai in it.</description>

<description>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side`s half of the court.

Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>parallel world</name>
<description>A parallel world, parallel universe, or alternative reality is a self-contained separate reality coexisting with our own. Because "alternative reality" sometimes implies that the reality is a variant of our own, like for example a mirror world, we use the term "parallel world/universe" which is more general, without any connotations implying a relationship (or lack thereof) with our own world/universe (meaning a fictional world can just as well have an alternative reality, it doesn`t need to be our reality). To put it more simply, this category is to show if more than 1 world/universe/reality is present in the anime.
Multiple timelines of the same world/universe/reality are NOT considered parallel worlds. For example, in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate] the cast travels through multiple "World Lines", which are defined as parallel timelines of the same universe had various events occurred with differing outcomes.</description>

<description>A mafia is a type of organized crime syndicate whose primary activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions. Secondary activities may be practiced such as gambling, drug trafficking, loan sharking, and fraud. The term was originally applied to the Sicilian mafia, but has since expanded to encompass other organizations of similar methods and purpose, such as in "the Russian mafia" or "the Japanese mafia", and is applied informally by the press and public, but the criminal organizations themselves have their own terms; for example, the original Sicilian and Italian-American mafia call themselves "cosa nostra", while the Japanese mafia calls itself "yakuza".

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<description>The anime shows elements of a `R`ole `P`laying `G`ame, either as part of a parody or because the anime is actually based on an RPG.
Typical elements: When collecting items, beating opponents, or levelling up a distinct (often childishly sounding) sound cue is played. A HUD (`H`eads `U`p `D`isplay) may also be presenting in combat, showing vital player and "enemy" statistics.</description>

<name>adapted into JDrama</name>
<description>This anime is a http://anidb.net/t2797 [new original work], and it has been adapted into a JDrama.
A JDrama (Japanese drama), also called "terebi dorama" ("television drama") or "dorama" for short, is a Japanese live action television series.
Japan produces many drama series every year, from a huge variety of genres. Like anime, they generally air in three-month seasons or multiples thereof, with new shows airing every season. Some kinds of drama, especially the morning or afternoon ones, tend to be broadcast daily, while evening ones tend to be broadcast weekly, also like anime.
In exceedingly rare instances, a specific episode of a new original work anime can also be adapted.</description>

<name>social commentary</name>
<description>Social commentary is the act of rebelling against an individual, or a group of people by rhetorical means. This is most often done with the idea of implementing or promoting change by informing the general populace about a given problem and appealing to people’s sense of justice. (Source: Wikipedia)&#13;
&#13;
Since this is anime, usually, the mores of Japan and the Japanese society are scrutinised, but not restricted to that.</description>

*synonymous jaws dropping*
This anime`s main character is comparable to the gods themselves in terms of resistibility, strength and/or downright bad-assery. Whenever they seem as if the fire inside has burnt out, they rise from the ashes with enough tenacity and ferocity to vanquish any foe that dare stand against them.</description>

<name>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</name>
<description>The title of Philip K. Dick`s SF novel (movie: Blade Runner). 
The phrase implies a set of existential questions: Do artificial beings (e.g. Replicants, Bioroids, or other AI constructs) dream, feel, or have a soul? If memories can be implanted, what makes real memories real? By contrast — what makes humans human? What is reality? 
These are central themes e.g. in all of the Ghost in the Shell and Appleseed series / movies.</description>

<name>narration</name>
<description>The most common example is that of a voice, either that of one of the characters or entirely unrelated, that appears at the beginning of an episode to offer a summary or introduction, and at the end of an episode for closure or for a preview to hint upon what to expect next.
Another use of narration comes in the form of a dominant voice belonging to one of the protagonists, intended only for the viewer and revealing the intimate thoughts to whom it belongs. This type of narration occurs frequently throughout the duration of the episode or movie.</description>

<description>The anime is derived or draws elements from the Greek mythology, and as such features some mythological characteristics of Ancient Greece. Those may be creatures, such as the Centaur or Hydra, tales, such as that of the Trojan War, or even the Gods themselves, like Zeus or Poseidon. More subtle references also count, such as the careful usage of names of places or people that hold significance in the myths.</description>

<name>Weekly Shounen Jump</name>
<description>The Weekly Shounen Jump is a Japanese manga magazine released on a weekly basis. Its main target audience consists of young males and it features several manga titles. The magazine was created by http://anidb.net/cr780 [Shueisha] in July, 1968, and was originally only called Shounen Jump, because it was not published every week at the time. A number of very famous shounen manga were or are published in it, such as http://anidb.net/a386 [Hokuto no Ken], http://anidb.net/a231 [Dragon Ball], http://anidb.net/a942 [City Hunter], http://anidb.net/a826 [Saint Seiya], http://anidb.net/a590 [Slam Dunk], http://anidb.net/a312 [Yuu Yuu Hakushou], http://anidb.net/a69 [One Piece], http://anidb.net/a239 [Naruto], http://anidb.net/a2369 [Bleach], http://anidb.net/a4563 [Death Note], http://anidb.net/a3468 [Gintama], to name a few of the most well-known.</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<name>perpetual ongoing</name>
<description>No end in sight!
No matter what the genre may be or what the storyline consists of, this series just keeps on going... and on... and on.
The obvious downside to this is the lack of story-related focus, usually some vague goal is simply never reached. This lack of conclusion can tend to annoy, making the whole series pretty much pointless.
Examples: One Piece, Naruto, Bleach, Detective Conan, Dragon Ball (Z), or Pocket Monsters (Pokemon).</description>

<name>mundane made awesome</name>
<description>Sometimes normal just doesn`t cut it. Eating: you put food in your mouth and chew. Playing sports: you throw a ball around. You need to make it awesome, no matter how mundane it is.
Let`s throw in some gripping orchestral music, lighting changes, different camera angles, something! Don`t write like a man, write like an evil overlord! Exaggerate your expressions and gestures, speak with excessive intonation, and if all else fails, throw in some close-ups, slow motion, and ominous Latin chanting! With practice, even you can turn something like eating chips into an epic battle of light and dark, blinding the viewer with sheer awesomeness.

<name>catchphrase</name>
<description>A catchphrase is a sound, word or phrase commonly used by a person. That may be simply out of habit, or in an attempt to deliver some form of image, like that of cuteness. In fiction, characters often use catchphrases as a way to deliver specific personality traits. Examples include Otohime Mutsumi`s "ara ara" in Love Hina, Yang Wenli`s "yare yare" in Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Misuzu`s "gao" in AIR, Sakura`s "hoe" in Card Captor Sakura, Suiseiseki`s "desu" in Rozen Maiden, and Ayu`s "uguu" in Kanon (as well as several other characters in the same show).</description>

<description>Ryuk is the main Shinigami of the Death Note series. Bored with the activities (or lack thereof) of the Shinigami realm, Ryuk obtains a second Death Note and drops it in the human realm for someone to find, hoping to amuse himself. He deliberately writes the instructions on the front page (in English, which he assumed to be the most popular language in the human realm) so people would understand its purpose. The Death Note is discovered by Yagami Light, and Ryuk follows him around for much of the series to see how Light uses it. Ryuuk has a fairly humanoid appearance. His skin is grey, or a purple-ish colour and his limbs are abnormally long and he has bulging yellow eyes with red irises.</description>

<description>Sakata Gintoki is the main character of the story. He has naturally permed hair, which he blames for his lack of a love-life. He rides a motor scooter and wields a bokuto, which has "Lake Touya" inscribed on it. His job, as is written on his business card, is a "free-lancer", meaning he`ll take any job for nearly any price. He enjoys reading http://anidb.net/cr5372 [Shounen Jump] comics and he has a sweet tooth and will go into crazed combat if he does not have his sweets (he has glycosuria).
In the past, he was a Joui (someone who attempted to overthrow Amanto to protect the government). The reason Gintoki does not join http://anidb.net/ch1165 [Katsura Kotarou] again to fight the aliens is that he does not like to fight alongside "gloomy terrorists".</description>

The Yato are said to have "transparent" (snow-white) skin that is highly sensitive to sunlight, so Kagura carries a purple parasol at all times. The parasol is also the Yato clan`s weapon of choice; Kagura`s is bulletproof and fires bullets from its tip. Because of her Yato blood, she is super-strong and can stop a speeding motorscooter with one hand. Although stronger than most humans, she cannot control her strength perfectly. Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu, have met with an untimely demise by her hands.</description>

[spoiler="Very late Gintama spoiler."]Although his initial methods were originally more violent in nature (for instance, sending a bomb to an Amanto embassy), Katsura has gradually grown to believe that there are people important to him in Edo, and decides that he no longer wants to destroy the country, but believes there should be a way to change it without causing sacrifices.[/spoiler]</description>

Elizabeth is something of a painter, and is surprisingly dexterous. Also, Elizabeth resorts to using signboards to "communicate", as well as an occasional means of attack. Elizabeth is also a skilled fighter, able to use signboards to fight off swordsmen.</description>

<description>The vice-commander of the Shinsengumi. Toushirou Hijikata is the famed chain smoking (he has hardly shown up on the screen without a cigarette in his mouth), "demon" vice commander of the Shinsengumi so named by his subordinates, because of his fearsome demeanor and also, possibly, his unsettling tendency to pile mayonnaise on anything and everything he eats. Purportedly the brains behind the force, he takes his work seriously, and is fiercely loyal to his leader, Kondo. Hijikata has a reputation as a fearsome leader, earning the nickname of "demonic vice-commander". He is also hot-tempered and often speaks of seppuku. However, despite his cold exterior, he does have a more compassionate side. He also has a tendency to cry after watching movies that aren`t particularly emotional, as demonstrated after he admits to crying during "Alien Vs. Yakuza" and breaks down weeping during "My Neighbor Pedoro." He also seems to care for Okita`s sister and is willing to sacrifice his life to protect her. These feelings, however, are usually kept bottled up and kept behind a mask of nonchalance, because he believes that with the life of violence that he lives, he will not be able to provide happiness for her.</description>

She often displays her trademark sweet-looking smile with her eyes closed before engaging in her violent activities. Her killer intent is so strong that on one occasion, a stare from her brings the entire Shinsengumi on their knees begging for mercy. Her weapon of choice seems to be a naginata, a Japanese spear.</description>

<description>A female ninja nicknamed Sacchan, supposedly from the Oniwabanshuu. She is severely short-sighted and often loses her glasses to hilarious - or disastrous - effect. She met Gintoki when she fell through his roof. When she tried to convince him that he had inappropriate relations with her, he briefly played along despite knowing that she was lying to get his help. Ever since that incident, she has become infatuated with him, much to his exasperation. Her feelings for him seem to be encouraged, as she enjoys being put down and threatened by him, due to her extreme masochism. Her attacks are mostly based on natto and bondage. She often follows Gintoki and the rest of Yorozuya around much to his knowledge, throwing objects at her to come out when he needs her help. She cannot stand Zenzo Hattori, her former Oniwaban comrade, and has "attacked" him at his "weak point" (his haemorrhoids) by shoving in an enormous syringe, wooden barbecue stick and a candle.</description>

<description>An idol pop singer whose song lyrics are often very dirty or controversial. She started her career singing on the sides of streets. This was when Shinpachi met her and has followed her ever since, being captain of her fan club. Her talent was recognized by Bansai Kawakami (under his producer alias "Tsunpo"), and she has since gained popularity. Her mother manages her, and her father is currently serving time in prison. When she was younger, her father made a bet with her, saying that if she became famous, he would bring a number of roses to her first concert. He broke out of prison specially for the occasion, and although he couldn`t give her the roses, he gave her a single flower. He donned a paper bag over his head, so he wouldn`t trouble her with his presence, yet she knew it was him, and thanked him with tears in her eyes.</description>

He initially believed that humans should focus on appeasing the Amanto, but after his encounter with Gintoki, his mindset changed, which led to him punching Hata out, thus getting fired. Since then, he has been living a life of somewhat like a loser, getting fired almost every time he gets a new job, mostly due to the unfavourable look his sunglasses and goatee give him. No matter what, he refuses to remove his sunglasses because it`s the only thing he had left to remind him of his successful past. Although he does exchange the sunglasses for a decent pair of half-moon spectacles at one point, he goes back to wearing them after he decides that he is going to live out his life in the best way he can. He is constantly seen working various part-time jobs.</description>

<description>Sadaharu has the outward appearance of a giant dog, but is actually an inugami. He was originally owned by a pair of miko sisters (Ane and Mone). His inugami powers are awakened if he consumes both strawberries and milk at the same time. He was named by Kagura, after her first pet, a rabbit which she accidentally killed while having a nightmare. When sitting on his haunches, he is taller than most humans. He was left in front of Gintoki`s apartment in a box that had "To Mr. Freelancer" written on it. Sadaharu chomps on anything smaller than itself, such as Gintoki`s and other people`s heads. Kagura seems to be the only one who can control him, for she has immense strength, though he chomps on her occasionally. Though he was dangerous when Gintoki first received him, he has become quite tame in the later episodes. He even obeys Gintoki at certain points, and has helped the main characters in many occasions. After a certain period of time, even Gintoki (who originally did not want Sadaharu around) refused to abandon Sadaharu or give him back to the miko sisters.
Recently, Sadaharu has impressed a yakuza`s boss and receives permission to date his dog (whom Sadaharu himself has fallen in love for).</description>

He is easily recognisable through his bandaged left eye, his colourful kimono, his eerie smile, and the pipe he is often seen smoking.
He, Gintoki, and Katsura studied in the same temple elementary school when they were children, and he fought with them against the Amanto invasion during the latter part of the Joui war. After the war ended, he vanished, and has since gained a dangerous reputation due to his assassination of many of the Bakufu`s main officers and his planning of a large-scale coup d`état. Before his first appearance in both the anime and the manga, he was mentioned to have fled Edo and to have been hiding in Kyoto, although it is unclear how long before this was.</description>

Gintoki often corrects him, citing that if he were named Kintoki, kin means gold (because `Kin` from `Kintoki` instead of `Gin` would make the title `Kintama`, which means `testicles` instead of `Gin Tama`, which means `silver soul`).
Despite his goofy nature, Sakamoto is actually a successful businessman in the galaxy. He believes that business is a way of protecting his country. He has a private, well-equipped defensive business fleet. He believes that sacrifices should be made for the good of the community, which is why he chose to abandon his comrades on Earth to travel into space.

<description>The female protagonist of To Love-Ru, Lala is the princess of Deviluke. A rather childish girl, she is somewhat naïve of the culture and familiarities on Earth. Lala initially runs away from home, citing she does not wish to get married to any of her arranged suitors. She enjoys making all manners of inventions (usually designed as pranks) and uses them frequently, often prompting some disastrous effect or another. Upon arriving on Earth, Lala pretends to love Rito to keep herself from getting married, but does exactly what she did not intend, after she misinterprets what Rito shouts in self-defence. Throughout the series, she always tries to get Rito to love her more, and barely shows any form of negativity towards him; she even states it is impossible for her to hate him.</description>

<description>Known as the "Red Comet" for his high-speed attack tactics, Char is the most famous of Zeon`s ace mobile suit pilots. He earned his nickname by destroying five Federation battleships during the Battle of Loum, and after the attack on Side 7, he becomes the dreaded nemesis of the White Base crew. However, defeating the Federation isn`t the only thing on Char`s mind, and his distinctive mask hides the face of a young man bent on his own personal quest for revenge. As the story continues, Char begins putting his own complicated schemes into motion, even as he becomes distracted by his growing rivalry with the Gundam`s pilot.

<description>The Joi War was a ten-year war of resistance, fought by the Japanese people against the Amanto (alien) invaders, who invaded Japan and eventually coaxed the Tokugawa shogunate into co-operating with them. Gintoki and several of his former allies fought during the tail end of the war, which had ended by the beginning of the series. Yet even during the period of peace, the more persistent members of the Joi faction have continued to resist the government, by means of terrorism and guerilla warfare.</description>

He cares little for the politics of soul society or its fate, but is happy as long as he gets to fight. He is a tall muscular shinigami with an enormous amount of spiritual energy. Though he is a monster in battle and attacks his foe relentlessly, he often purposely holds back in fights in order to prolong his enjoyment. Kenpachi`s zanpakutou has no name and no apparent abilities; it is also incredibly worn and battered from its long battle history.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kuchiki Byakuya is the 28th head of the noble Kuchiki clan, one of the four great noble families in Soul Society. As such, Byakuya acts in an aristocratic manner — he seems always serene and apathetic towards other people, even when he is actually deeply conflicted. He is also extremely calm, even in battle, and is very seldom surprised by even the most drastic of actions. Ironically, when he was younger, he was quick to anger and very hotheaded, as noted by his grandfather, http://anidb.net/ch9327 [Kuchiki Ginrei]; similar to the the way http://anidb.net/ch2069 [Ichigo] and http://anidb.net/ch8722 [Renji] are now.
Byakuya strongly believes in law and order. As the head of one of the great noble families and as a captain in the http://anidb.net/ch9291 [Gotei 13], he always works hard for a peaceful society. He thinks that if someone in his position doesn`t follow the rules as a good example, then no one will follow them. He believes that to maintain the order, all law-breakers must be punished, even if that goes against his own wishes. Despite his icy and regal manner, Byakuya cares for and protects those important to him, even referring to http://anidb.net/ch3720 [Rukia] as his "pride".

<description>Kagura and Kamui`s father and one of the last members of the Yato clan. His wife is deceased. Like Kagura, he fights using an umbrella, but is also shown to be strong in his own right. He is one of the few characters able to overpower Kagura. He first appears when an alien appears and takes over the Terminal, helping the Yorozuya defeat the creature. It is revealed that he has a cybernetic arm due to his son claiming his original in battle.
After he leaves to travel the galaxy hunting aliens, he`s next heard from in the form of a letter. He tells Kagura that Sadaharu is also a monster they should get rid of. He becomes the leader of the "Principality" in the anime, recruited by a Char Aznable doppelganger. In the manga, he`s recruited by a Darth Vader lookalike.
Later in the manga and anime series, he also participated in a hair growing shampoo advertisement, of which the Yorozuya complained that the advertisement was too long.</description>

<description>The Gundam is one of three prototype mobile suits secretly developed by the embattled Earth Federation. After suffering tremendous losses to Zeon`s mobile suits earlier in the war, the Federation set out to create its own, using the very latest advanced technology. The Gundam is the most successful of these prototypes, a close-combat mobile suit protected by tough Luna Titanium armour, and armed with both lethal beam sabers and a devastating beam rifle as powerful as a battleship cannon. It`s also equipped with an advanced computer which learns from its pilot, ultimately enabling it to operate the Gundam automatically. In the hands of accidental pilot Amuro Ray, this one prototype mobile suit proves to be the equal of any Zeon weapon.</description>

In Episode 83 he was seen by Yorozuya at http://anidb.net/ch16984 [Snack Smile] club to have very small male genitalia. He seems to have terrible luck as regardless of the http://anidb.net/ch10409 [Yorozuya] attempts to help him enjoy himself, he was constantly put in more and more humiliating positions thanks to their game.</description>

<description>Kuraba Touma is http://anidb.net/ch12345 [Okita Mitsuba]`s fiance. He pretended to ask for her hand in marriage in order to get close to http://anidb.net/ch6221 [Shinsengumi] and manipulate them from behind the scene in order to facilitate his own illegal dealings with Joui extremists.
Eliminated by http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Okita Sougo] in the http://anidb.net/ch6221 [Shinsengumi] raid during the military arms transaction with http://anidb.net/ch6222 [Jouishishi] extremists at the harbour.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Single-handedly brought up younger brother http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Okita Sougo] when their parents passed away while Sougo was still very young, Okita Mitsuba admitted herself that she pampered http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Sougo] until he is spoilt rotten, resulting in the aloof character that he is now. She took such great care of him that she neglected her own health and developed tuberculosis, and forfeited her own chance for marriage when she was of marriageable age. As a result, http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Sougo] respected her immensely, addressing her very respectfully as ane-ue (姉上) and using the formal courteous form boku (僕) to refer to himself when speaking to her. She in turn called http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Sougo] affectionately as sou-chan.
Mitsuba`s sickly condition deteriorated when she came to Edo to be with her husband-to-be http://anidb.net/ch12344 [Kuraba Touma], who unbeknown to her, was using her and http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Sougo] as pawns in order to `buy over` http://anidb.net/ch6221 [Shinsengumi] so as to allow his own illicit arms trade with http://anidb.net/ch6222 [Joui] extremists.
Sends http://anidb.net/ch6221 [Shinsengumi] tear-inducing extra-spicy senbei (flavoured rice crackers) every month.
Her last words to http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Sougo] before she passed away in Episode 87 were `You are the brother that I am so proud of`.
Though younger brother http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Okita Sougo] resembled her a lot superficially, character-wise they are exact opposite. Mitsuba is the archetypal virtuous female character, termed yamato nadeshiko (大和撫子) aka traditional feminine virtues of olden Japan, as well as the stereotype figure of bijin hakumei (美人薄命) aka the beautiful die young.
Loves to add spice to all the food she eats, fanaticism on par with http://anidb.net/ch1167 [Hijikata] and his mayonnaise. Adds tabasco sauce to chocolate parfait. Expressed her wish to follow http://anidb.net/ch1167 [Hijikata Toushirou] to Edo when they were still in Bushuu (武州), but was rejected by him, out of concern for her safety and happiness. Although it is revealed that http://anidb.net/ch1167 [Hijikata] does in fact love her, he feels that he is unable to give her happiness, that is why he treats her coldly.</description>

<description>Jiraia the Spider (real name Danzou Tobita) was born in he country side to Iga Samurai, and had a talent for ninjutsu since he was a kid. The Tobitas were a prominent household charged with being the land owners. He was next in line to inherit the family`s power, but someone did not agree with this. So big fights began, and the Tobitas were destroyed. Only Danzou and his sister survived, and in order to protect his sister, Danzou had to work under the people he hated. He became a war machine, and tried to escape reality by fighting. Her sister, knowing that she was the problem, threw herself from a cliff. Danzou could not forgive himself of being unable to protect his sister. So he burned his face and lived a life in solitude. He tried to kill the Shogun, but Hattori`s father stopped him. In the end, to stop his pain, he decided to get killed by someone who resembles him. So he raised a student, Tsukuyo, and taught her everything he knew. So Jiraia came back to Yoshiwara to take Tsukuyo. He defeated Gintoki, because he thought that he was one of Tsukuyo`s weakness. Then he burned the other Tsukuyo`s weakness, Yoshiwara. But thanks to Shinpachi, Kagura, Hattori and Hinowa, the fire was extinguished. Gintoki went to save Tsukuyo from Jiraia, and the fight began. Jiraia was defeated by Gintoki, but he was killed by Tsukuyo, like he wanted. He died looking at the moon, embracing Tsukuyo. He was the strongest man in the Oniwabanshu, and the one who created the Hyakka. His name is based on Jiraiya.</description>

<description>Inoue is the leader of the gang http://anidb.net/ch1164 [Kagura] joined when she first came to earth. Inoue found Kagura and he knew in an instant that she is a descendant of the http://anidb.net/ch10785 [Yato clan] so he offered to give her food in exchange for the services that Kagura would provide for him, which was to fight other gangs that were competing with Inoue`s own gang, Punch Perm.
Kagura found out later that she was fooled by Inoue and she later left the group after beating Inoue and shaving his afro. Afterwards, she became a member of the http://anidb.net/ch10409 [Yorozuya]. Inoue appears wearing a pair of sunglasses and an afro, the trademark of his gang.

After Pesu escaped, http://anidb.net/ch1162 [Gintoki], http://anidb.net/ch1164 [Kagura] and http://anidb.net/ch1163 [Shinpachi] got stuck in the jar that was supposed to lure Pesu out and rolled down the hill, flattening Pesu in process. They brought back Pesu to http://anidb.net/ch1677 [Prince Hata] and http://anidb.net/ch1655 [Hasegawa] and were told cooking it in hot water will bring it to its normal size. Kagura, however, boiled it in a big pot of water, making it grow large. Pasu went on a rampage and was killed shortly after by Gintoki.</description>

<description>A Newscaster in Oedo TV. His name was paid homage to Kusano Hitoshi. He has a habit on calling http://anidb.net/ch1677 [Prince Hata] a stupid prince that berated him.
In Episode 29-B, Kusano interviewed http://anidb.net/ch1677 [Prince Hata] over the giant cockroaches infested in all of Oedo, particularly Kabuki-cho. Once Baka... Hata explained the infestation, he gave the stupid prince a camel clutch, or other submission moves.</description>

<description>The originator of the http://anidb.net/ch16972 [Justaway] explosive.
He used to work in a government but got laid off due to company restructuring, and he became a terrorist in his bitterness. He started a factory, taking in displaced and bitter samurai who also wanted revenge. The factory acts as a front for the manufacture of http://anidb.net/ch16972 [Justaway], which is actually a bomb. http://anidb.net/ch1658 [Yamazaki Sagaru] was sent here as a spy to uncover more about the mysterious http://anidb.net/ch16972 [Justaway] in Episode 32. It turned out that the factory also manufactured heavy artillery like the http://anidb.net/ch16974 [Mamushi Z] laser canon.</description>

<description>Nishiki Ikumatsu is the owner of a ramen shop called Hokuto Shinken (北斗心軒). She and her husband, http://anidb.net/ch17029 [Daigo] intended to turn the ramen shop into the best in Edo, but her husband died due to http://anidb.net/ch6222 [Jouishishi]`s terrorist activities before they could do it, as a result of which she holds a deep grudge against Jouishishi members. http://anidb.net/ch1165 [Katsura Kotarou] worked at her ramen shop when he was injured and on the run from http://anidb.net/ch6221 [Shinsengumi]. He helped to rescue her when her brother-in-law betrayed her.
Although she now knows that he is a Jouishishi member, they are on friendly terms. http://anidb.net/ch1165 [Katsura]`s subsequent television interview by http://anidb.net/ch17094 [Hanano Saki] was carried out at her ramen shop.
http://anidb.net/ch1162 [Gintoki] is known to be a frequent customer, and he would patronize her shop every time he gets some money from his jobs.</description>

He moves in next to the http://anidb.net/ch10409 [Yorozuya] and starts a flower shop (which incidentally gives the whole of Edo hay fever). His appearance completely terrifies Gintoki and friends when he comes over to give a welcome gift (a flower).
Although he looks hideous and frightening, he is in reality a peaceful being with a green thumb, who loves all life, particularly plants and insects. In episode 68, it is revealed that he is afraid of ghosts.</description>

<description>Kanbee is a gambler who could read luck with his right eye.
A legendary `charisma` gambler, he is also known as Tsukiyomi no Kanbee, tsukiyomi meaning "(luck) easily attaches". He is first encountered by http://anidb.net/ch1162 [Gintoki] and http://anidb.net/ch1655 [Hasegawa] during their losing streak. After discovering that the legendary gambler is cheating, the three are taken prisoner by Kujaku Hime and told to play Mahjong against one of her players. During the match their opponent asks if Kanbee could really read luck to which he recalls the incident in which his eye was damaged. He had to cut his luck-reading right eye deliberately in order to rescue a friend who was held hostage.</description>

Considered a genius scientist by the community, he plotted his own `death` to turn into a robot himself, i.e. http://anidb.net/ch17301 [No.502].
Knowing that his daughter may not live long, he conducted experiments on his own sickly daughter to extract her personality data, which eventually hastened her death.
http://anidb.net/ch1678 [Hiraga Gengai], the other inventor genius in Edo, said that their philosophies towards machines are the exact opposite. He said Porfessor Hayashi`s creations are beautiful and intricate, whereas his machines are crude and ugly.</description>

<description>Sickly daughter of http://anidb.net/ch17304 [Professor Hayashi]. Her mother passed away when she was young, and father decided to make toys to keep her company. These toys eventually evolved in complexity to become robots like http://anidb.net/ch7827 [Tama].
Already frail to begin with, she complied with her father`s request to conduct experiments on her to extract her personality data, which only hastened her death.</description>

<description>3 times the size of the average Amanto, the 3rd generation queen of Planet Gorilla. Due to deteriorated diplomatic ties with Earth, marriage between Commander http://anidb.net/ch1657 [Kondou Isao] and the princess was mooted to improve the diplomatic relationship. During wedding ceremony, which involves consummation of the marriage on the spot, http://anidb.net/ch1657 [Shimura Tae] gatecrashed the party to presumably rescue the minors, namely http://anidb.net/ch1163 [Shimura Shinpachi] and http://anidb.net/ch1164 [Kagura] from having to watch such an act, marriage therefore did not materialize.</description>
