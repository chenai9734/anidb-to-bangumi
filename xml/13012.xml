<description>Ordinary high schooler Yuhang Bai took a cheesy online test out of boredom, and was selected by a mysterious organization "STAR Alliance". Dicing with death, Yuhang Bai and other three candidates survived the admission test and became team members of the new STAR Warriors. As the welcome gifts, they received special equipment fueled by JingShengLi (spiritual power). The rookies grown rapidly in each dangerous but magical tasks, also grown were the bonds in between them. Yuhang Bai gradually realized that STAR Alliance is not as simple as he thought, and that he may have a deeper connection with it.
