<recommendation type="Must See" uid="41949">Can`t even [i][b]begin[/b][/i] to fathom the pressure on the Samurai 7 staff to create something befitting the original movie`s 50th anniversary. 

[url=http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=character&amp;charid=3958]Kyuuzou[/url]`s death scene popped into my head today as it sometimes does -- the [i]pièce de résistance[/i] of the anime version. Having watched Kurosawa`s [i]Seven Samurai[/i] 8 times, part of me dies whenever I see Seiji Miyaguchi bite the dust. However, the anime depiction of this event resonates even more than the original, something I (and I`m sure many others) never imagined possible. 

Samurai 7 is a must-see, especially if you are a fan of the original movie.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="450118">Akira Kurosawa - a great auteur, Seven Samurai - an amazing film; Samurai 7 - equally fascinating anime.

Its nt just for fans, its a must-watch. its a Masterpiece. Lovely music overall.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on http://anidb.net/cr9464 [Kurosawa Akira]`s famous Seven Samurai movie.
In an alternative past with highly advanced warfare machinery, on a planet that might have been called "Earth", a war involving mechanized samurai took place. After the long war, people enjoyed a modest peace. The effective rulers of this new time were a small group of high-class merchants, wealthy and powerful enough to negotiate with the Emperor himself through His envoys, to hire all the military power they felt like, and to keep a harem at their service.
In those days, villagers everywhere suffered in the hands of bandits, ruined samurai who no longer followed their code of honor. After the war ended, they lost their purpose to fight, and they turned their efforts into robbing the villages of their crops and women in order to sell them. Because the villagers had no way to fight against them, they had to obey the bandits` orders, or suffer heavy punishment. This also meant that the villagers had little rice of their own, and had to eat very little in order to not starve to death. This happened to many villages everywhere.
One year, before harvest season, the head of the Kanna Village proposed that they should hire samurai to protect them from the bandits. http://anidb.net/ch3950 [Rikichi], a man full of energy but who is easily frightened, http://anidb.net/ch3961 [Kirara], the village`s water priestess, and http://anidb.net/ch3949 [Komachi], Kirara`s younger sister, go into a town to look for samurai to help them.</description>

<name>trap</name>
<description>A trap is a plot device where a male character is mistaken for a female, with the intention of sexually deceiving other characters and/or the viewer. This behavior does not need to be intentional by the male (it is often not intentional) or continually maintained by the male, but the occurrence is common enough to deserve this fetish-specific tag.
This is often achieved by portraying the male character as a female; primarily via their clothing and physical appearance, but also through his behaviour, and/or language. A male character misinterpreted by others as female, without action from the male (explicitly feminine dress or behaviour), is generally not considered a trap; instead they are likely just http://anidb.net/t2561 [androgynous].
The reverse case is known as a http://anidb.net/t1637 [reverse trap].

<name>cyborg</name>
<description>A cyborg is a cybernetic organism (i.e. an organism that has both artificial and natural systems). The term was coined in 1960 when Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline used it in an article about the advantages of self-regulating human-machine systems in outer space. D. S. Halacy`s Cyborg: Evolution of the Superman in 1965 featured an introduction which spoke of a "new frontier" that was "not merely space, but more profoundly the relationship between `inner space` to `outer space` -a bridge...between mind and matter." The cyborg is often seen today merely as an organism that has enhanced abilities due to technology, but this perhaps oversimplifies the category of feedback.
Fictional cyborgs are portrayed as a synthesis of organic and synthetic parts, and frequently pose the question of difference between human and machine as one concerned with morality, free will, and empathy. Fictional cyborgs may be represented as visibly mechanical (e.g. the Cybermen in the Doctor Who franchise or The Borg from Star Trek); or as almost indistinguishable from humans (e.g. the "Human" Cylons from the re-imagining of Battlestar Galactica). The 1970s television series The Six Million Dollar Man featured one of the most famous fictional cyborgs. Cyborgs in fiction often play up a human contempt for over-dependence on technology, particularly when used for war, and when used in ways that seem to threaten free will. Cyborgs are also often portrayed with physical or mental abilities far exceeding a human counterpart (military forms may have inbuilt weapons, among other things).
Real (as opposed to fictional) cyborgs are more frequently people who use cybernetic technology to repair or overcome the physical and mental constraints of their bodies. While cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals, they can be any kind of organism.

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

In some cases there is futuristic technology present, but the overall setting still feels that of the past. However the setting must still take place on Earth, since we can not know if the history of a fantasy world is an alternate one or not.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>manly tears</name>
<description>Somewhere down the line, it became the "norm" that boys don`t cry. The scenario does not matter; shedding tears is the ultimate no-no in terms of what you can and cannot do as a man (at least in the West, anyway). But there comes a time when a man`s emotions do get the better of him, and they pour forth - as prerequisite an impassioned speech may or may not be present - by cascading down his cheeks. These are what we like to call "manly tears". Extremely powerful. Not limited but often used in hot-blooded / super robot shows. Examples include Yuusha Ou GaoGaiGar, Getter Robo and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.
The opposite of manly tears are "girly tears".</description>

<description>The precocious young Komachi is http://anidb.net/ch3961 [Kirara]`s younger sister. Upon hearing that her older sister would be journeying into the city to seek out samurai, Komachi virtually forces herself into the search party. She is a bundle of energy, being highly active, and also the kind to never be afraid to ask any question to any person. Overall, she is blunt in a charming, childish way.</description>

<description>Rikichi is a humble farmer who accompanies http://anidb.net/ch3961 [Kirara] and http://anidb.net/ch3949 [Komachi] into the city in the search for the Samurai. Rikichi is the first villager to suggest that they defend themselves against the bandits, fallen samurai who turned into stealing the villages` crop and women. It is his farmer`s resolve that gives him the strength to serve as Kirara`s guide and protector. Rikichi is also in charge of carrying the rice that the village plans to use as payment for the services of the samurai they hire.</description>

<description>Ukyou is the spoiled son of the local magistrate, http://anidb.net/ch3952 [Ayamaro]. His daily existence consists of eating the finest food, sleeping in the most comfortable castle in town, and romancing his cadre of willing young female partners. He is used to getting things his way. His father wishes he would get his head into business, but Ukyou resists, preferring a life of leisure to one of work. Upon seeing http://anidb.net/ch3961 [Kirara] he vows to take her into his harem.</description>

<description>Ayamaro is the portly local magistrate. He is a cut-throat businessman who only desires more money and more power through whatever means necessary. The wealth he has accumulated as a powerful merchant allows him to keep the townsfolk as his subjects, to the point of him being the effective master of everything that goes on. He has enough soldiers under him to do as he pleases, including elite samurai, and a harem. He spoils his son http://anidb.net/ch3951 [Ukyou] a lot, hardly ever being strict with him in spite of Ukyou`s slowness to do any job and tendency to just do whatever comes to mind.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A highly experienced, educated, fearless and skilled swordsmaster, Kanbee is the embodiment of everything a great samurai should be. Yet, he considers himself a failure. He fought for the losing side of the war, where he was in a key role. After the ensuing collapse of the samurai age, Kanbee felt "like an empty shell, a hollow remnant living long after it`s served its use." Having no master, having no cause, and being ashamed for losing and for surviving when others died, he felt like his life should already be over, until http://anidb.net/ch3961 [Kirara] managed to enlist his help for the defense of Kanna Village.</description>

<name>Kikuchiyo</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kikuchiyo is a very strong mechanized samurai with a steam-powered arm that swings a massive sword that can tear through brick walls. However, Kikuchiyo is not at all skilled. In fact, all he knows about fighting he`s made up as he`s gone along, by emulating real samurai. The reason he has no skill is that he received no training, as he was actually born a low-class farmer, just like the people of Kanna Village. Kikuchiyo is a very careless and somewhat happy-go-luck person, often acting quite childish, which leads his companions to suspect he`s actually no older than the early teens, possibly about as young as http://anidb.net/ch3949 [Komachi], who in turn very much enjoys teasing him about that.</description>

<description>After fighting in the war and joining the countless ranks of ronin samurai, Gorobei became a street performer, using his fighting skills to pay for his meals. Desecrating his skills in such poorly thought of jobs is a very dishonourable fate for a samurai, but Gorobei doesn`t care. He`s rooted more in the real world than ideals. His experience as a street performer gives him a greater ability to sense stealth attacks and quickly react on them.</description>

However, most of all, he joins the team to stay close to http://anidb.net/ch3954 [Kanbee], waiting for the day the two can fight to the death.</description>

He likes the idea of a quiet life, and tries very hard to settle down, believing that fighting is not for him. However, after meeting Kanbee again, his taste for battle pulls him back.</description>

<description>Heihachi is a younger samurai, mostly self-taught, and a skilled machinist. If he did have any involvement in the war, it was as an engineer, not in direct combat. Since then, he`s been a lone nomad, going wherever he feels like, collecting machine parts, paying for his room and board by chopping wood, and so on. Aside from dealing with machinery, he can use his sword to perfectly slice wood into whatever he wants to, even toothpicks.</description>

<name>Kirara</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kirara is Kanna Village`s water priestess. Her title affords her a certain level of reverential treatment from the other villagers, even from her elders, and as such she has a somewhat high degree of freedom in comparison to most female villagers, generally being allowed into discussions where all men but only the elder women would take part. Regardless of her status, however, she is far from being arrogant, and in fact she volunteers to take the burden of seeking the samurai that will defend her village. Kirara has the best outcome for her village first and foremost in her mind, and her faith in the samurai she takes back home with her is unshakable.</description>
