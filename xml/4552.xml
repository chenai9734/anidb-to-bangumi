<description>The thing you searched for is not anime by AniDB standards. http://wiki.anidb.net/w/FAQ:Anime [Please see our wiki for more information.] Such items include, but are not limited to:

* American or European cartoons made for American or European audiences (*cough* Avatar *cough*);
* Live-action TV series or movies;
* Manga series or games that have not (yet) been turned into anime;
* Motion comics;
* Advertisements without a plot;
* Entries that belong to our other systems instead, such as creators or fansub groups;
* Some random stuff you thought would be fun to search for.

The point is, what you searched for has been determined not to be an anime by the moderators. If you have read the rules described in the wiki and think something may have changed since it was determined not to be an anime (for instance, manga that is now being released as anime), then you can post to the http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=forum&amp;id=21 [Change Requests] forum with information supporting your claim.</description>
