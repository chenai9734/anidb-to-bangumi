<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="36359">A casual high-school romance. Everything is extra sweet, from the story to the drawings and the music. Even the trauma is a sweet cliché. Apart from the romance, the other theme is friendship. This is a simple world were parents don`t really exist, nobody is never evil, and people deeply change after hearing a few words. The characters are (intentionally?) plain. It`a a work weel done and a decent watch, but there is absolutely nothing original in Aoi Hare Ride.

It can be compared to Karekano in the same way Disney`s movie "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" is related to Victor Hugo`s novel "Notre-Dame de Paris". This is a smooth product intended for a large audience, with nothing that would shock a 5 years old, and a very standard art. I wonder what King Lear would look after the same process, with no salt and an abondance of sugar?</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="24572">First, the "childhood romance gets a second shot after years of separation" theme is very common (like: Myself; yourself , Kimi no Iru Machi) and retrospective storytelling got endless possibilities. Ao Haru Ride manages to combine drama with school life and coming-of-age without sacrificing romance too much. It offers thoughtful advice in finding `true friendship`, but keeping a heartwarming, humorous atmosphere between the serious moments. The character development is great - especially the protagonists.

Perhaps a shame the manga is reduced to a mere 12 eps, unknowning if there will be more seasons (there are some hints toward the end but usually the romance animes end in standalones). Still this anime is great quality and highly recommended.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="432184">Great! Everything in this is great or better, great animation and the most lovable characters drawn, great and easygoing plot, great development. It`s  a shame that its so short and kinda ending lacking but this only leaves me hopeful for a 2nd season!

Give it a chance!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="17039">This is, how to tell...
Imagine Kare Kano told anew.
But a bit more "today".
OH GOSH!!1! This is beautiful. Oh, yeah, and ... romantic.
I have to admit it is more attractive to a westener like me, because of the fact that the characters act more like modern people do. Not this  anoying "glare at each other and don`t dare to say a word"-crap.
Refreshing. Yes. Very much so. Must see, i say.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="612872">WELL great anime just the limitin romance you want

worth the watch</recommendation>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school.

And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<description>A watercolour or aquarelle is a painting method in which the paints are made of pigments suspended in a water-based solution. Some anime are created in the style of watercolour paintings, the watercolour style, usually with faded pastels that often give the show a warm and friendly visual presentation. In modern anime, this is generally achieved via computer effects that create an imitation of watercolour, rather than by creating real-life watercolour art. While the watercolour style is more commonly used for backgrounds, it is possible to create the entire anime in such a style.</description>

<description>Usually girly tears are the ones not shed by men (duh).

And where`s my beer, woman?".
So that`s how it goes: girly tears are for girls and sissies! Chuck Norris forbid a guy would weep watching something that has this tag! Now 20 push-ups!
P.S. The opposite of "manly tears". Or is it? Let`s face it - it`s all subjective (and relative, and context-dependent).</description>
