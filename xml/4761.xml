<description>Robot bugs suddenly attack Tokyo and robot gamer Ryusei is given a real, mechanical robot trooper to see whether he is a qualified fighter in a war which he has just now become a part of. Amazingly the controls to the personal trooper are just as in the game.

<description>The military, also known as the armed forces, are forces authorized and legally entitled to use deadly force so as to support the interests of the state and its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its citizens and the prosecution of war against foreign powers. The military may also have additional functions within a society, including construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding critical areas.

Not having even finished school, they are inexplicably designated to elite status or roles, typically requiring months of training and years of experience.

<name>zettai ryouiki</name>
<description>"Absolute Territory" (絶対領域, Zettai Ryouiki in Japanese) describes the area of uncovered thigh between the skirt and the knee sock.
As per usual for fandom who obsess about costumes, this can be considered a moe attribute and thus, present prominently in character designs and schoolgirl outfits. The term originates from http://anidb.net/a22 [Neon Genesis Evangelion] to designate an area of Absolute Terror, although it`s had considerable semantic drift. In this case, it may jokingly refer to the fact it emphasizes a shorter skirt without actually becoming creepy and showing the underpants.
As if that wasn`t enough, some even categorize it into five "Grades", from E to A. Only the top two (A and B) are considered true Zettai Ryouiki and they are only usable by female characters. Some researchers additionally introduce Grade S, the highest one which consists of Grade A plus further requirements to personality and hairstyle.
Just to make it clear, Zettai Ryouiki is made up of three components: socks, skin, and skirt. An Action Girl may trade the latter for hotpants but if it doesn`t include knee-highs and thighs, it`s not Zettai Ryouiki. Panty Shot is an entirely different zone.

<name>talking animal</name>
<description>Talking animals are a common theme in mythology and folk tales, as well as children`s literature. Fictional talking creatures often are anthropomorphic, possessing human-like qualities but appearing as a creature. An animal that only knows how to say its name (for example, 99.9% of all http://anidb.net/t2493 [Pokemon]), are not talking animals.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>medium awareness</name>
<description>Medium awareness is the situational and generally temporary awareness characters in works of fiction have and display of the very fact that they are characters in works of fiction. For example, they may comment about the background music, quip about the script or narration, complain about the roles given to them by the writer or their lack of screen time, see the subtitles that appear on screen, inform the audience about the arrival of the commercial break, and even use medium effects as tools. The most common form of medium awareness is known as breaking the fourth wall, in which characters speak directly to the audience, either to it as a whole or to specific members of it. The "fourth wall" is the imaginary "wall" at the front of the stage of a proscenium theatre through which the audience sees the play; it is a metaphor for the boundary between what happens inside the work, to the characters, and outside it, to the audience.</description>

The player assumes control of one or several fictional characters (a party) who have joined forces in order to perform quests and overcome a great number of challenges and enemies, usually monsters inspired by fantasy, and, to a lesser extent, science fiction and classic mythology. During the course of the game the characters, or avatars, which are generally defined by quantized characteristics, evolve and improve in that their various attributes increase, as well as by gaining more powerful artefacts.</description>

<description>The conspiracy thriller (or paranoid thriller) is a sub-genre of the thriller which flourished in the 1970s in the US (and was echoed in other parts of the world) in the wake of a number of high-profile scandals and controversies (most notably Vietnam, the assassination of President Kennedy, Chappaquiddick and Watergate), and which exposed what many people regarded as the clandestine machinations and conspiracies beneath the orderly fabric of political life.
The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top".</description>

<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<name>Excellen Browning</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A purely fun loving entertainer it`s Excellen`s habit to tease younger and thus less experienced crew-members, especially Bullet, on private matters like relationships, always speaking in an unserious cutey-girly manner. She`s always first to add weird nicknames on others and intentionally mistakes idioms for some daily slapstick. Though showing this light hearted attitude most of the time, she still knows to act serious on occasions, as indeed she is very skilled in range fight and dodging attacks. Despite his cold treatment of her on the outside, she deeply loves her Kyousuke, always supporting him either on battlefield or financially after another lost bet. She`s also a hard-drinking woman, accompanying her superiors at times, as she just loves to entertain.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kyosuke is of hotblooded nature, a fierce close combatant, but stays quiet most of the time outside the battlefield, also making him an excellent tactician, whos foresight of enemy behavior never seems to fail. Famous for his unbelievable good luck to survive terrible accidents and dangerous combats likely unharmed, he also loves to gamble, always betting on the worst odds` side. He and Excellen form up a great combination in their PTs, also being a couple in private. Though Kyosuke constantly seems to ignore his girlfriend and her lovey-dovey sweet talk in public, he holds her dear more than anything else, so whoever might dare to harm her will be doomed to have summoned her darling`s true rage. He still holds his former commander Zanger in high regards, despite his betrayel, as he respects his reasoning and both share a similar personality, mostly stoic but "do-or-die"-mentality in battle. With Zanger gone, Kyosuke becomes also a mentor to Bullet, whos impetuous behaving has to be tamed at times.</description>

Here, she becomes SRX Team member Ryusei Date`s high school classmate and childhood friend, developing a crush on him. However, Ryusei never shows his interest in women and their relationship is far from that of a real couple. While accompanying Ryusei to the Burning PT Tournament, Kusuha was injured when the stadium was attacked by Aerogaters. Kusuha eventually drafts into the Earth Federation Army, as the medical crew of the Hagane, in order to help Ryusei, after he was recuited into the SRX Team. Through Ingram Prisken, Kusuha becomes the pilot of the Grungust Type-2, due to her newly discovered Psychodriver background. She doesn`t meet Bullet until the end of the Divine Crusaders War, when she and the SRX Team particpated in live-fire exercise against the ATX Team. When Ingram betrays the team, he would manipulate Kusuha into siding with the Aerogaters, but be rescued by Bullet. With Operation SRW over, Kusuha transfers to the ATX Team.</description>

<description>Brooklyn "Bullet" Luckfield is a fictional character in the Super Robot Wars series. In the Original Generation universe, Bullet is already an Earth Federation Army pilot and student of the Jigen-Ryu tradition of swordsmanship, under the tutelage of Master Rishu Togo, alongside his senior, Sänger Zonvolt, to whom he shows great respect for (in the Alpha universe, Bullet does not actually meet Sanger until Alpha 3, and it is directly from Sanger that he trains to refine his skills). Bullet does not meet Kusuha until after the Divine Crusaders War, when he and the rest of the ATX Team are ordered to attack Kusuha and members of the SRX Team in a live-fire exercise. Bullet, upon discovering that a girl (Kusuha) is the pilot of the opposing Grungust Type-2, refuses to lay a hand on her. Although he is slightly reprimanded for his conduct, he is smitten with Kusuha the moment he sees her in person, but is too shy to display any romantic feelings for her.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Younger son of Maier von Branstein and so brother to Elzam Rai didn`t follow a military career in the ranks of the Colony Corps as he broke away from his noble family early and left their home of colony Elpis. He adopted the name of Fujiwara from his late sister-in-law Kathreia, who he held in high regards, as he blamed her husband for her death during the terrorist encounter known as " the Elpis-incident". Still being a highly skilled pilot he shifted to Earth Alliance as test pilot for the RTX-007 Hückebein. A catastrophic malfunction of its black hole-engine left him heavily wounded, the reason he is hiding his crippled left hand under a glove. A calm and collected person with great pride from the start, this past forged him a slightly sinister character with lacking humor, resulting in the early quarrels between him and Ryu after being assigned to SRX-team thanks to Irm`s recommendation. Though just being a year older Rai always criticized and lectured him in an arrogant manner as he saw his team mate just as an inexperienced robot maniac-child without any sense of tactics and only limited pilot skills, but later acknowledges him due to his improvements as a comrade and also kind of rival. He feels a bit uncomfortable about the admiration 7 years younger princess Shine holds for him, as he became her "prince on his white horse", but indeed cares for her. Still he has to solve his issues with his brother as well as his cousin Leona as she tried to mediate between both. Being the only SRX-pilot without any T-LINK abilities Rai is in charge of the Tronium-engine of the machine.</description>

<name>Ryuusei Date</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>At 18-years old, Ryuusei Date is an extremely hot-blooded young individual. A mecha otaku, Ryuusei is heavily into mobile machines, specifically those of the super robot type. When he receives his R-1, he was disappointed at the fact that it was a real robot, but was surprised at the specifications of the SRX, where it is classified as a super. Ryusei has an odd habit of naming certain attacks, and often shouts them aloud when performing them, á la classic super robot pilots. He abbreviates some of the SRX`s and Banpreios` attacks with the words "Tenjou Tenga", literally meaning "Heaven and Earth".
Before joining the SRX Team, Ryuusei was a childhood friend with Kusuha Mizuha. Though she initially developed a crush on him, Ryuusei didn`t return the same feelings, either due to his obsession with mecha, or because he simply didn`t share them. He does show some support for the relationship she develops with Brooklyn Luckfield, however. His relationship with the rest of the female cast of Original Generation is still in question, but it seems he is exceptionally close with Latune Subbota and Aya`s sister, Mai. While he doesn`t show much interest in women, he usually says that mechs with feminine shapes and appearances, like Lune Zoldark`s Valsione, Lamia Loveless` Angelg or Virtual-ON`s Fei-Yen the Knight, are cute or sexy.
Ryuusei proves influential to the women he is close with. Both Latune and Mai have begun imitating his otaku nature in attempt to garner his attention, though this has yet to produce any significant results.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A very shy and silent girl, with particularly powerful Psychodriver abilities. Mai is loyal to those that have helped her, including her sister Aya, her father Kenzo, her crush Ryusei Date and the rest of the SRX Team. She also seems to be particularly close to Latune Subbota, Shine Hausen, Arado Balanga and Seolla Schweitzer, probably due to their similar ages.
Mai has a crush on fellow SRX Team member Ryusei Date. This gives her a sort of rivalry with Latune Subbota for his affection, however, they remain close friends. She`s adapted some of his mannerisms, including shouting during attacks. This crush is taken to its logical conclusion in Super Robot Wars Original Generations, in which Mai (piloting the ART-1) and Ryusei (piloting the R-1) get a combination attack, the T-Link Double Knuckle.
As Levi, Mai has a completely different personality. Believing herself to be the leader of the Balmarians, due to mind-washing, Levi is ruthless, sees humans as nothing more than weaponry for the Balmarians, and seems to have little concern for anything other than her. She`s also particularly egocentric, thinking that nothing can defeat her and her Judecca.</description>

<description>16 years old. She`s the daughter of Bian Zoldark, leader of the DC. She has superhuman reflexes, eyesight, and coordination. She`s beautiful, but is still a tomboy. She is weak to compliments and flattery. Her three sizes are 87, 59, and 88.
She encountered the Hiryuu Kai and Hagane after her father was killed in combat. She ends up joining them since she`s not happy with what the DC has become, since she knows it wasn`t what her father wanted. She falls in love with Masaki, though he doesn`t feel the same way. She`s always trying to get him to compliment her.
After the war with the Aerogators, Ryuune recieved a request from Guilliam to accompany him into the Aerogators space fortress, Neviim, which was currently being held under the federations jurisdiction.
Her father created the Valsione for her after she stated that she disliked the Valsion`s design.</description>

<description>It`s one of Langran`s four Masoukishin, and is also one of the seventeen Masouki that were designed to fight against the revival of Volkruss and its minions.
It`s been blessed with protection from the Wind class` Saint Grade spirit, Cyfith. This Masoukishin is one of the fastest units ever created, and the only one to gain the ability to transform. In Cybird form, it allows the Cybuster to have even more speed and agility, which also allows it to travel at high-speeds in any atmospheric areas.
The Cybuster is basically equipped with same system equipment as other Masouki, but what makes it different is the Laplace Demon Computer; a computer system which is sought out by many, as it has the power to foretell the future.
During one of its early appearances on Earth, the Earth Federation designated this mech as AGX-05, which was later declared a misnomer, seeing as the Cybuster was also fighting against the Aerogators.</description>

It`s equipped with a system that is similar to the DML System, which allows Ryuune to control its movements with her own.</description>

<description>The R-2 is the second unit in the R Series developed for the SRX Project. Its full name is "Real Personal Trooper Type-2."
The R-2 specializes in heavy artillery fire, and is equipped with beam weapons as its main offense. It has the heaviest firepower of the three R units. It`s equipped with very heavy armor, which slows it down drastically, and oftenly causes it to overheat easier due to the instability of the Tronium Engine. A jet engine is equipped on its legs in order to give it a hovering ability, so it can be more maneauverable. It`s also equipped with a beam barrier.
On the battlefield, the R-2`s role is attack from the distance, while R-1 fights at close range, R-3 supports from the rear. The R-2 was originally supposed to be equipped with a T-Link System, just like R-1 and R-3, but it was decided that the unit would be piloted by a non-Psychodriver.
Its right hand is equipped with a Beam Chakram, while its left has the Beam Shield. The Beam Chakram was supposed to be a Psychodriver weapon, but it was modified into a wired type weapon after the unit`s concept was changed. The Beam Chakram can be considered as the prototype for the Huckebein MK-II`s Chakram Shooter.</description>

Its shoulders are equipped with two Hi-Zol Launchers, as well as each of its arms having solid shields. Its beam barrier was upgraded into an AB Field. Its firepower and armor were also increased greatly.
During the combination into SRX, the Hi-Zol Launchers become SRX`s arms and hands, while its main body and shields act as the SRX`s main body and chest armor.</description>

<description>The R-3 is the third unit in the R Series developed for the SRX Project. Its full name is "Real Personal Trooper Type-3."
The R-3 was designed to be used by the team leader, and acts as a long ranged support unit on the battlefield. It`s equipped with the T-Link System, and uses it to remotely control its Psychodriver exclusive weapon with high speed and precision. Due to the R-3 requiring high speed, it has the least amount of armor out of any of the R units.
The cockpit is a small capsule that is located on the R-3`s chest.</description>

<description>It`s the ultimate general purpose PT developed for the SRX Team. It`s formed when "Formation OOC" is activated, causing R-1, R-2 Powered, and R-3 Powered to combine into one machine. It has three pilots; Ryuusei Date, Raides F. Branstein, and Aya Kobayashi. Each of them take control of various parts of the unit. It`s a machine that was developed by using knowledge obtained from all types of technology know-how, such as the Gespenst series and the Huckebein series.
It`s capable of flight due to it being equipped with the T-Link system, and is even able to form barriers, enabling it to block minor attacks. This machine was developed with the concept of creating a new unit that has features of both super robots and real robots, and to change the situation of the war by combining the three machines into a single powerful unit.
If the Tronium engine is used at full output, then it will explode. It can also combine with the R-Gun Powered, enabling it to use its strongest attack, Tenjou Tenga Ichigeki Hissatsu Hou. When the Uranus System is activated it can tell the pilots life signs and damage situation, though it`s also very dangerous due to the fact that if it gets overloaded with psychic energy, it may cause the pilots brain to collapse.
This SRX is a prototype of the true SRX which will be created in the future, and will be piloted by three Psychodriver pilots.</description>

Several people have test piloted it, but they all suffered a mental breakdown. Levi Torah was able to sucessfully operate it. It`s equipped with something that is similar to the T-Link System, and it can even create a Nendou-like field. Even if the unit is destroyed, it`s possible to restore the unit since it has Zehirut Crystals, which will allow self-restoration. The serial number given to it from the Earth Forces is AGX-14, and its recognition code is "White Death Cross."</description>

<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>It`s a custom unit developed by the Aerogators, that was created by Ingram once he returned to them. Its recognition code is "Black Angel." It`s the ultimate machine that combines various forms of technology that Ingram was able to obtain from the Earth. It uses Earth, La Giars, and Aerogators technology, which can be noted by its attacks, such as the resemblance between Astranagant`s Gun Familiar and Cybuster`s Familiars.
Its primary power source is a Quantum Wave Engine. It has the ability to absorb various energies from parallel dimensions, and it`s even capable of moving through time and space. It`s also equipped with the T-Link System, which allows the Nendou field to be used along with other psychic based weapons. Since its armor is made from the Zehirut Cystal, it`s able to self-repair on its own. It`s thought to be the only unit that can fight Shuu Shirakawa and his Granzon evenly.</description>

<description>The Aerogators` combat mother ship. It`s a very large ship, with it`s total length being equal to the Hagane`s. It stores many Megillot all along its sides. It`s hard to find since it is equipped with a special space navigation device that hides its position. The serial number given to it from the Earth Forces is AGX-04, and its recognition code is "Flower."</description>

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>It`s the second model in the Grungust series. The Grungust`s Gustlander mode was omitted in order to allow for greater efficiency. EOT was used in its development.
Its armor surpasses all PTs and AMs that were created before it, and it`s even capable of creating a TK Field due to the T-Link System that it`s equipped with. It`s able to transform into the G-Hawk mode, which allows it to fly. The transformation mechanism is the same as the one that`s found in the R series machines. Because of this, it`s able to transform much faster than the original Grungust model.</description>

<description>The R-Gun is the first in the RW series, which are option weapons designed to be used by the SRX.
It`s capable of transforming into the Hyper Tronium Buster Cannon mode, or HTB Cannon mode for short. In this form, it has the appearence of a gigantic gun.
It was developed with a PT mode in order to allow it to fight alongside the SRX Team, allowing them to have the time needed to transform and combine into SRX.
It`s equipped with the T-Link System, allowing the pilot to freely control the direction of its beams. It`s also able to use a TK Field because of it. It also has a Tronium Engine installed, allowing for even greater performance.
While it was being developed on the Moon by Mao Industries, its code name was "Argun."</description>

<description>The base of the R-Gun was transformed because of the effects of the Zehirut Crystal. It was based off of various types of technology using the data from things such as the SRX Project, Cybuster, Granzon, and Valsion. Its form is similar to that of the Astranagant, which exists in a parallel world. In this world, Ingram was not able to obtain the Cross Gate Paradigm System from Euzeth, and was not able to create the Astranagant.</description>

<name>AGX-07 Zechariah</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>With the Earth Forces exhausted from the aftermath of the Divine Wars, the Aerogator forces decided to make their move by uncloaking their mother ship Neviim and assaulting the Earth with wave after wave of new, previously unseen mobile weapons.
One of these mobile weapons was the Zechariah, code named "Soldier" by the Earth Federation. The Zechariah was a humanoid mech akin to a foot soldier. Like all Balmar Mobile Weapons, the Zechariah was created from the Zyfluid Crystal, which not only gave the mech the ability to regenerate, but also meant that there could be a near unlimited number of units created. It was the data from machines like the Zecharia stored within Meteor 3 that allowed the federation to discover Extra Over Technology and create their own mobile weapons.
During the Aerogator invasion, the Zechariah would replace the weaker Megillot as the Balmar main forces. While it is not the strongest machine possessed by the Ze Balmary empire, its balance of maneuverability and firepower make it an ideal mass produced frontline weapon. Like all weapons of alien origin, little is known of the Zechariah`s full capacity or weapon systems. It is known that that the machine is typically manned, although it can also be controlled by the same AI system used on the Megillot.</description>

<charactertype id="4">Vessel</charactertype>
<description>At the close of the Divine Wars, the EFF would not have much time to rest. An abnormal gravity distortion at the fifth Lagrange point would signal the appearance of the Neviim Battlestation, the central piece for a Ze-Balmary invasion force. Giving it the codename AGX-06 White Star, the EFF forces would scramble to form an attack plan against this strange new threat. At the same time, Neviim would launch countless attack forces made up not only of the Megillot, but also of more powerful humanoid machines only previously seen by mankind in the form of data contained within Meteor Three.
The actual size of the White Star is 40 kilometers in diameter and it effectively appears as Earth`s artificial second moon. Even after the Aerogator conflict, the White Star would remain, and prove a critical role in future wars.</description>

<description>It is a superior model of the Zechariah developed by the Aerogators. It takes the best qualities from the Zechariah and the Habakkuk, and combines them, making a unit that exceeds the performance of the originals. It is not suited for mass production since the costs are high and it was used mostly for small operations such as bodyguard duty or leading a squad. There are variations such as the Sagol, Adom, and Lavan which can form a Nendou field which strengthens it`s gravity control. It`s serial number given to it from the Earth Forces is AGX-12, and its recognition code is Knight.</description>
