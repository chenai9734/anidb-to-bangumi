<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="56708">watch this with the same frame of mind that you would watch violence jack, demon city shinguku, except that`s its a super hero sci fi story. but, the way they are similar is that its classic 80s and early 90s vintage anime. plot is left unfinished as it departs from manga. first anime i ever saw, and the design of the guyver is the coolest idea i`ve ever seen from an anime. there are still some scenes that are directed so well - 1st six episodes better than 2nd half but still! this is a must watch! just don`t expect closure, you have the later series for that (up to a point :@)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="719485">The first 6 episodes of this OVA, blew me away, no shit. . . 
The guyver idea, a bio weapon, were (for me at least) left marvel or what, in the super YAWN!
 Anyway, yes these first 6 were twice as good as the seq, make sure to watch the ones with the `Out of control` theme tune (original un-dubbed was a let down). I thought some of these scenes were cool, little things make this 6 part OVA unmissable. The 26 parts anime, not a patch on this. Why they destroyed the sequel 6 is beyond me(well just watch 11 and 12).</recommendation>

<description>Shou and his friend, Tetsurou, stumble upon a strange orb-like mechanism, the Guyver Unit, in the woods. It physically bonds with Shou and turns him into the alien soldier, Guyver. His mission is to protect the Guyver Unit from the Japanese corporation known as Chronos. They are after it and two other units just like it. To retrieve the object, they send out vicious monsters known as Zoanoids. So no one is safe in Shou`s life; not even himself.

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>mecha</name>
<description>Mecha in Japanese basically means mechanical things; everything from an electric whisk or a car to a spaceship or a robot. Here however we limit it to the more exotic things usually referred to as mecha anime: robots, whether controlled by a human or not, and their ilk. See Androids, Piloted Robots, Power Suits, Robot Helpers, Transforming Robots for a more specific classification.</description>

<description>Power Suits are similar to Piloted Robots which are controlled from inside the robot except that Power Suits tend to be more directly tied to how the character moves and they are usually not as big as Piloted Robots can be. They are still mechanical and shouldn`t be confused with plug suits.</description>

<name>parasite</name>
<description>Parasites are life forms that feed off other beings in some way. In anime, they are often aliens and usually intelligent. For shock value, and to avoid having to draw aliens all the time, their prey is preferably human; they may see humans as food, as puppets for mind control, or simply as temporary body hosts. In every case, the human is the victim of a "merging", which is not to be confused with the more "amicable" symbiosis.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>Fukamachi Shou is main protagonist of the series. A 17 years old, second-year student at a Tokyo-area high school, Shou cares deeply for Segawa Mizuki and has a romantic interest in her. Tetsuro Segawa, Mizuki`s older brother, is his closest friend. He comes across the mysterious Guyver unit, which merges with him and takes form as "Guyver I." Chronos is now in pursuit of Shou, wanting the return of the Guyver unit. Now, Shou must fight for his life and protect those close to him against the Zoanoids of Chronos.</description>

<description>Guyver One is Sho Fukamachi , an ordinary high school student, who was merged with a bio-booster symbiont completely by accident. Chronos has attempted anything in their power to get the bio-weapon back... and thus turned Guyver One into one of their most deadly enemies.
Although Guyver One is probably the least powerful Guyver due to the nature of its host as it can be assumed that all Guyver Units have the same power levels so differences between them come predominantly from their Hosts, he is nevertheless a formidable opponent. He is also the warrior who succesfully merged with a Creator-ship, and as a result created the Gigantic upgrade. This alone makes him unique.</description>

<description>Agito is a third-year student at the same high school the others attend. He almost never allows sentiment to stand in his way. He doesn`t even show much expression in his face, but acts quite friendly at school. He finds a Guyver unit and merges with it to become "Guyver III." Agito also seems to have extensive knowledge on the Guyver and its abilities and exhibits them quite well. Agito seems to have his own agenda when it comes to dealing with Chronos. He is an excellent example of an anti-hero.</description>
