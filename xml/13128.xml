<description>The term "KiyaKiya" comes from the old Japanese expression "mune ga kiyakiya suru." I first encountered it in Shibusawa Tatsuhiko`s book Introductory Essays on Girls, in the chapter about "childhood experiences." The expression, which describes "an enigmatic, nostalgic, disturbing feeling," or an impression of "deja-vu", is at the origin of my "KiyaKiya" series.
In our everyday routine, there are moments when suddenly we feel like something is different; this unexpected change, like in my memory, feels like it has a kind of reality. This impression is at the core of "KiyaKiya" and the related painting and drawing series.
