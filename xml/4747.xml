<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="431902">It starts slowly but enjoyably, with some light, comedic episodes. Then, after episode 20, the action starts - and it gets really good up until episode 75 or so, when they go to the future. Then, the anime turns into a broken shell of its former self. The excessive amount of science fiction and the lack of character development and engaging action that ensued afterwards really turned me off. Which is a shame, `cause I could really see this anime going a long way.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="243995">As any other hardcore shounen type of series, this show has its ups and downs. 

One thing that you might find a bit annoying about this series in particular might be the comedy. After awhile it looses strength and becomes less and less funny as it progresses.  It becomes a bit of the same old thing over and over.

Then we got what I would call the “Serious Arcs”.  Those arcs are what make the series enjoyable and worth checking out.  This is where we get to see Tsuna at his best (not just whining about not wanting to be a mafia boss…) as well the rest of the cast (Hayato, Ryouhei, Takeshi, Lambo, etc, etc…)

I’d recommend this just for fans of the shounen genre that don’t mind dealing with a lot of episodes (+100) and some worn out humor.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="185646">Very slow and no climax exitement.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="310610">Great Anime, you will never get bored with every episode</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="241433">At the beginning, it`s like, meh, comedy with little to no action. But later on, the action part really shines through. I really like it (currently ep 40) so far, especially when it goes into action. Can`t wait to see more!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="51844">GOOD ANIME.MUst watch</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="198068">I can only describe Hitman Reborn! as an afterschool special tv toyko kind of anime :P
go Lambo-san FTW!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="47691">it starts off slowly, but once the mukuro arc starts things improve, and the current vongola ring arc is good watching. not quite on par with the manga, but still worthwhile</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="121028">Muito Bom essa serie  show de bola</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="481315">Story and idea is great. Characters are nice and interesting. The only thing that might annoy some people is the protagonist`s constant loss of faith in his abilities.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="198133">hmmm...Hitman Reborn is one of those animes that are totally unorganized with a lot of randomness and small spurs of excitement stuffed here and there in usually very tediously slow story line. Now i dont know much detail about how KHR came about...i know theres a manga out there but with the amount of filler in the story i have no idea how true the tv series is to the main story; watching it would make you believe its an anime made for tv.

Goods:
Take the concept of 666satan, create a world of weapons, summons and eventual upgrades then add technicality to the fights (a few of them atleast).

Cultural Education. This anime is extremely localized. Although most of us have been watching animes for a long time, KHR served as a good insight to the cultural ethos in Nippon! :P 

Bads:
Annoying characters, including the protagonist.

Too much randomness and filling sections, almost enough to make you stop watching.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="242315">very good.  Interesting storyline.  The arcs gets better everytime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="229996">Muito bom anime! Poderia ter mais episódios!! =D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="638942">Beginning few episodes are dull but gets a bit good at around 20ish. Some characters need a bit more build up, and some characters are annoying, like Gokudera. Some are cool like Yamamoto, others are fogettable. Overall decent but not great.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="578755">Best anime of fight. I would like to see more of the continuation of this anime!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="281309">Slow beginning with minimum fight scenes but past the 30th episode and you are hooked with great action , comedy and super powered fights.

a must see for those who like shounen type animes like naruto, bleach, hunter etc.. the only bummer is that there is no blood like in the manga</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="27155">Great Anime. Storyline, characters are great. You don`t want too stop watching.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="145509">This series is long and it starts really slow, but it`s all worth. Every battle, every person, every single thing counts to the climax. The beginning will feel like a long filler, but none of it is wasted.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="112258">GREAT, gets really good later.</recommendation>

Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<tag id="2606" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2018-11-05">
<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<tag id="2607" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2009-04-29">
<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<tag id="2608" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2012-12-04">
<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>A mafia is a type of organized crime syndicate whose primary activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions. Secondary activities may be practiced such as gambling, drug trafficking, loan sharking, and fraud. The term was originally applied to the Sicilian mafia, but has since expanded to encompass other organizations of similar methods and purpose, such as in "the Russian mafia" or "the Japanese mafia", and is applied informally by the press and public, but the criminal organizations themselves have their own terms; for example, the original Sicilian and Italian-American mafia call themselves "cosa nostra", while the Japanese mafia calls itself "yakuza".

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>In our terms, a proxy battle is a battle where humans use creatures/robots to do the fighting for them, either by commanding those creatures/robots or by simply evolving them/changing them into battle mode. Often the training aspect is also involved, or in some cases the proxies are nothing more than holographic representatives of some other variation of competition (like for example a card game). While many popular shounen anime fit under this category, it`s not limited to shounen anime.</description>

<name>ohanami</name>
<description>Hanami (花見, lit. "flower viewing") is the Japanese traditional custom of enjoying the beauty of flowers, "flower" in this case almost always meaning cherry blossoms or ume blossoms. 
From the end of March to early May, sakura bloom all over Japan, and around the first of February on the island of Okinawa. The blossom forecast (桜前線 sakurazensen, literally cherry blossom front) is announced each year by the weather bureau, and is watched carefully by those planning hanami as the blossoms only last a week or two. 
In modern-day Japan, hanami mostly consists of having an outdoor party beneath the sakura during daytime or at night. Hanami at night is called yozakura (夜桜, literally night sakura).

<description>A common device for a series opening or Establishing Character Moment. Things begin in a frantic rush which usually results in taking short cuts, such as eating breakfast on the run. The classic image is of someone running down the street with a slice of toast hanging out of their mouth, dragging their backpack with one hand while trying to put on their jacket or sweater one-handed with the other, bumping into important people in a manner that gets the plot started.
Basically, they`re never on time for school. While some are Heavy Sleepers, it would appear that they may have simply set their alarm clocks so as to give them insufficient time to get to class.

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

<description>The seven deadly sins, also known as the capital vices or cardinal sins, is a grouping and classification of vices of Christian origin. Behaviors or habits are classified under this category if they directly give birth to other immoralities. According to the standard list, they are pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, and sloth, which are also contrary to the seven virtues. These sins are often thought to be abuses or excessive versions of one`s natural faculties or passions (for example, gluttony abuses one`s desire to eat).

<description>Reborn is the holder of the Yellow pacifier. The titular character, Reborn is an infant hitman belonging to the Vongola Family. As the Vongola IX`s most trusted member, he becomes Tsuna`s home tutor and trains him into becoming a mob boss. Since he is an official Vongola member and is only there to train Tsuna, he is not allowed to directly interfere with most of Tsuna`s battles, though he is allowed to defend against attacks directed solely at him.</description>

<description>Tsunayoshi "Tsuna" Sawada is the 14-year-old central character of the series. Because of his severely low self-esteem and lack of talent in any activity, Tsuna is known as "No-Good Tsuna" at his middle school Namimori. After being informed that he is the heir to the Vongola Family, due in part to him being the great-great-great grandson of the first Vongola boss as well as the untimely deaths of the other candidates for the position, he is trained into becoming a mob-boss by the infant Vongola hitman Reborn. Tsuna is often shot by Reborn with a bullet that increases his physical abilities in order for him to fulfil his regrets.</description>

<description>Takeshi Yamamoto is the 14-year-old popular baseball star of Namimori Middle School. Despite his carefree and outgoing personality, he initially has no confidence in doing anything other than baseball, even attempting to commit suicide after sustaining major injury to his arm. After Tsuna reassures him, the two become close friends, and Reborn tries to recruit him into the Vongola Famiglia. He hardly takes anything seriously, and is usually oblivious to what is truly happening around him, often tricked by Reborn into participating in Mafia-related events because he thinks that they are all just playing a game.</description>

<description>Ryohei Sasagawa is the 15-year-old passionate member of the boxing club at Namimori Middle School. He constantly asks others he believe are strong to join his club, most notably Tsuna. In response, Reborn wants to recruit him into Tsuna`s family. Every time he sees Tsuna and his family doing something strange, he gets fired up and always wants to be a part of it. Because of his energetic character, however, he does not understand the full extent of Tsuna`s connection with the Mafia, but still does everything that he can to protect him and fights with as much spirit and confidence as the others. Proficient in hand-to-hand combat, his boxing training lead to his peak physical condition. He is a habit of always saying "to the extreme" as a single response or as an ending to his sentences.</description>

He has a huge afro (which he stores a variety of objects in, such as snacks and weapons) with horns on the sides of his head. Despite being a hitman, he lacks the emotional maturity and discipline that Reborn has and is also very conceited as well as being a crybaby. In order to prove that he is worthy of becoming his own family`s boss, he comes to Japan to kill Reborn, though he only proves that he is no match for the Vongola hitman. His main choice of weapons are hand grenades, and his future dream is to rule the world. He also possesses his family`s Ten-Year Bazooka, which replaces his present self with another version of himself ten years into the future. The 15-year-old Lambo remains a crybaby, though his good looks make him more charming to others.</description>

<description>I-Pin is a 5-year-old assassin from Hong Kong. She is regularly transformed into her 15-year-old self by way of Lambo`s Ten Year Bazooka. The 15-year-old "Adult I-Pin" is now fluent in Japanese, and despite the fact that she is one of the most promising young assassins, she works part-time at a Chinese Restaurant ten years later in order to earn money for college tuition, though she still retains her skills. I-Pin`s main ability is the usage of Gyoza-Ken, which combines her martial arts abilities with special gyoza buns laced with the scent of garlic, the latter of which numbs the brain and forces the muscles to involuntarily move on their own. Her most destructive ability is the "Pinzu-Timed Super Explosion", activated whenever I-Pin expresses extreme shyness. Pin-numbers (such as those used in mah jong) appear on her forehead, counting down until it turns her into a human bomb that can create a small crater with its destruction. Due to her near-sightedness, she sees Lambo as the broccoli monster, and often beats him up. She also has a crush on Kyoya Hibari, who looks like her master, and often activates her Pinzu-Timed Super Explosion after seeing him.</description>

The Founder of the Vongola Famiglia and thus its first boss and the creator of the Zero Point Breakthrough. He first appeared in Chapter 158. After his retirement, he moved to Japan and started a family, of which Tsuna is a descendant. He is the great-great-great-grandfather of Tsuna. Tsuna has repeatedly been shown to be very much like him, as they have the same weapon and techniques (including the Zero Point Breakthrough), similar appearances, and equally unorthodox Families (the first Family included kings, military men, rival mafiosos, and religious people). Their Guardians are quite similar as well: Yamamoto, Hibari, Mukuro, Lambo, Gokudera, and Ryohei have already been shown to be very much like their predecessors in appearance, weapon of choice, and personality. </description>

Fran has a calm demeanor despite being very antagonistic towards the other people, constantly verbally attacking them. According to Reborn! Volume 25, his profile is top secret, but he was featured alongside Bel in Reborn`s Weekly Horoscope as a Sagittarius.
It was later revealed that his master is Mukuro Rokudo, who was released from the Vendicare Prison thanks to Fran`s help.

Colonnello has a tendency to add "-kora!," or "hey!," to the end of his sentences. He wears black army boots and a camouflage bandana around his head. He is in charge of the training ground behind Mafia Land and was a former member of the COMSUBIN, and, because of that, he is not averse to using heavy artillery, using an anti-tank rifle as his primary Weapon. He has mastered the martial arts of karate and SAMBO. Falco, the bird on top of Colonnello`s head, helps him fly to distant places. Colonnello acts as a rival towards Reborn and vice-versa, but despite this, he shares many traits with Reborn, like being a merciless tutor, suddenly taking naps (while talking a lot of the time), and having a sharp tongue.

<description>He is a crazed womaniser who hits on every cute woman he sees. Though often unsuccessful, he is always seen hitting on one woman and then instantly moving on to flirt with the next woman that passes by him.
Putting aside his normal attitude, Shamal happens to be a notorious assassin called "Trident Shamal" and is also a renowned doctor who refuses to treat men.
He uses Trident Mosquitoes, one of which is named Angela, to infect his targets with deadly illnesses. His assassination skill is so great that he was once asked to join the Varia.
Also, since he naturally contracts viruses and diseases easily, he carries 666 pills that contain Mosquitoes infected with deadly diseases. He claims to be infected with 666 diseases, but is not dead because all his diseases negate each other. An example would be if he had a disease that rapidly decreases body temperature, then he has another one that increases it.
Shamal also happens to be the one that introduced Gokudera to Bombs when he used to work for Gokudera`s old Mafia Famiglia. Gokudera initially wanted to learn how to use the Trident Mosquito, but Shamal taught him how to use mid-ranged Weapons instead.</description>

<description>Spanner has blond hair and is almost always seen wearing a green one-piece jumpsuit and black boots. He was an engineer in the Millefiore`s Tech Department at the Melone Base and was a B-Rank Officer of the Black Spell. As one of the Millefiore`s genius mechanics, he was responsible for the creation of the Family`s Mosca units, including the King Mosca and the Mini Mosca (in the anime). Currently, however, Spanner has been recruited into the Vongola Famiglia by Tsuna after the transportation of the Melone Base by the Hyper-Flame Ring Transfer System. Spanner is described as a "relaxed" character who doesn`t seem to get as worked up as Shoichi. It`s revealed that Spanner and Shoichi go way back and met each other at a Robotics Competition in High School. They were also in the Tech Department together when they were both with the Millefiore. According to the anime, Spanner makes his own lollipops and designed them to improve one`s abilities, both mentally and physically which is why he is always eating them.
He`s a technophile and loves Japan because of their advancements in robotics. He`s also interested in the power of the Vongola, to the point where he doesn`t mind betraying his Family to help Tsuna complete the X-Burner. He`s also competitive when it comes to mechanical engineering, going as far as challenging Giannini`s skills as the current Vongola technician.

<description>Verde is the holder of the Green Pacifier, and his Animal Partner appears to be a crocodile or alligator. Verde was briefly mentioned by Reborn as the person who sent assassins to kill Tsuna. Apparently, Verde has knowledge about camouflage and invisibility; so, he gave his subordinates suits that can make them invisible to everyone but children. Verde believed that he should be able to see his subordinates in case they ever tried to sneak up on him in an attempt to kill him. Verde is also one of the three scientists who developed the Box Weapons in the Future, where he is said to be dead. He doesn`t seem to care about anything except his experiments, even going as far as to destroy anyone who would resist, including the other Arcobaleno. However, he will repay debts that he owes. In the anime, Verde was said to break the "pact," which might be explained later in the manga. Verde and the rest of the Arcobaleno are brought back to life from their Pacifiers when Yuni is brought towards Byakuran and Tsuna. Verde and the rest of the Arcobaleno are fully revived erasing all the damage in the Future. Verde engages Irie in conversation about exactly how humans can comprehend the calculations for such a phenomenon.

<description>has long since been the most powerful Mafia family in all of Italy since its creation 400 years prior to the start of the series. They are considered to have a violent and bloody history,and have had several other Mafia families and organizations serving them, including a few members from the infamous Arcobaleno.Giotto a.k.a. Vongola I (Primo) is the founder of the Vongola Family. He was known to have had an unorthodox family; that is, he accepted anyone he liked, including kings, military men, rival Mafia members, and even religious people.The organization has also been on the receiving end of secret black ops military technology, which has bolstered their strength over the years.Those who inherit the Vongola bloodline have certain unique traits; some traits are consistent, with every Vongola in each generation possessing it like heightened intuition,while sometimes it would skip either one or possibly even several generations. They also possess the Vongola Rings, seven invaluable rings which have been around since the founding of the Mafia underworld and are usually in possession of the main members known as the Vongola Guardians.They are also rich in various traditions,most notably the Vongola Tournament, a traditional battle in which two groups vie for the seven guardian positions.</description>

<description>Dino is the 22-year-old tenth generation boss of the Chiavarone Family which is part of the Vongola Family alliance. Dino is a young man with great skills as a fighter and a leader. Reborn`s chameleon Leon created his main weapons, a whip and Enzo, which is a turtle which grows in size and rampages when soaked in water. Like Tsuna, Dino, at first, was a klutz who did not want anything to do with the Mafia, but he became a suitable Mafia boss after Reborn became his home tutor. He came to be known as "Bucking-Horse Dino" and fixed the Chiavorone`s financial problems, turning them into the third most influential family. Dino, however, is so devoted to his family, that when none of his family members are around, his skills decrease dramatically, often accidentally hitting people with his whip and falling down the stairs. Dino becomes Hibari`s home tutor before the Vongola Tournament, and travels with him around the country in order to train him. In the future, he advises Tsuna and the others on how to control their box weapons, and is shown to release a horse from his own box. He is first voiced by Kenta Kamakari, and then replaced by Kenn for episodes 34 onward.</description>

Specifically, the First Rain Guardian sold his instruments for a trio of short swords and a single long sword. Yamamoto`s Kojirou can Cambio Forma into a similar sword, called Asari Ugetsu. </description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>1st Vongola Generation Cloud Guardian
Alaude headed a secret intelligence agency in an unidentified country. He physically resembles Hibari, and despite their preference for solitude Dino notes that they both show benevolence towards allies, even though Hibari`s manner of doing so is outwardly unfriendly and even violent. His Weapon of choice was known as Alaude Handcuffs, and Hibari`s Cloud Hedgehog can Cambio Forma into a similar Weapon.
Alaude was a powerful fighter who never stood with the rest of the Family. However, it was said that whenever Giotto`s and his version of justice coincided, he took down more enemies and showed more compassion than the others.</description>

<description>1st Vongola Generation Mist Guardian
Daemon Spade is a dangerous Illusionist. He does not resemble Chrome in anyway but he physically and mentally resembles Mukuro in personality and actions, and Reborn stated that he was a backstabber, much as Mukuro has frequently noted that he is merely biding his time for the opportunity to possess Tsuna. He was said to be able to curse enemies by glaring at them through his Weapon called Demon Spade`s Evil Lens which resembles the Vongola Mist Owl`s Cambio Forma, though "cursing" is likely a metaphorical reference to what happened to anyone he disliked. Also, it was said that those who were glared at through the Evil Lens would be found dead, floating in the sea the next day.
Also he`s the one who made Vongola Primo(Giotto) step down from the boss seat and sent primo to japan after that Vongola Secondo(Ricardo) take over the boss seat.</description>

<description>1st Vongola Generation Sun Guardian
Known as the Vongola Primo`s Sun Guardian, as well as an undefeated boxing champion. Due to his sheer strength, he accidentally killed an opponent during a match and soon after dedicated his life to God. At his Family`s moment of crisis, however, he gave himself 3 minutes to fight and managed to save his friends when they truly needed him. The First Sun Guardian and Ryohei, Vongola Decimo`s Sun Guardian, have a strong resemblance in their Weapon of choice, their way of fighting and their physical features.
According to Lussuria, he was able to break lights with the pressure of his punches.</description>

<summary>The long battle in the future finally comes to an end. However, the group has suffered some major losses. Tsuna begins to have doubts that this devastating battle was as important as he had thought. Just then, the Arcobaleno comes up with a way to bring everything back to normal with the information they received from Yuni’s flames. With this solution, Byakuran’s evil doings would be erased from the past. Not only that, the past in which people perished at the hands of Byakuran would be changed so that their lives would not be lost. A new past would be born, and it would lead to a brighter future.

<summary>Byakuran is surprised at Vongola Primo’s unexpected visit. Apparently, his arrival could not be foreseen even with Byakuran’s access to parallel worlds. Yuni explains to Byakuran why Vongola Primo has come. The reason has something to do with the Sky elements of the 73 policy. Vongola Primo says that he is there to unleash them. He seems to be referring to the Vongola rings, but will this provide Tsuna the opportunity to power up?

<summary>Tsuna is almost crushed by Byakuran’s power. The two of them keep firing back at each other with increasingly bigger Deathperation Flames. Then, out of nowhere, Tsuna’s and Byakuran’s rings begin to resonate very loudly. Yuni is in hiding far away from them, but her pacifier starts to fire Deathperation Flames and make the same noise as well. Reborn thinks that the Sky elements are contacting one another. Yuni floats up into the air, and she is taken in the direction of Byakuran and Tsuna against her will. Yuni seems to be headed for danger. What is happening?!
