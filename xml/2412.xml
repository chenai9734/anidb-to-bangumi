<description>* Based on http://anidb.net/cr22904 [Umeda Youko]`s manga.
Katsumi has been playing baseball for years, disguising herself as a boy. However, one day she is recognized and scouted by Hoshiyama, the manager of the Chunichi Dragons, who offers her a chance to become a professional player. After Katsumi joins the Dragons and befriends their new catcher Oikawa, her skills win over one suspicious mind after another, and she becomes a star pitcher leading the team to victories.
— written by Singan
Note: Although their opponents were fictional, team members of the Chunichi Dragons were based on the real-life team. Hoshiyama, depicted as the manager of the Dragons, was a real-life sports commentator at the time.</description>

<description>Baseball is like a complicated version of Rounders. It involves hitting a ball with a stick, then running around several bases placed in the form of a diamond on a field. Big in the US, and also in Japan.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>
