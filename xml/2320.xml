<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="18949">The best ever made serie about spirit of music band !
Rock`n`Roll !!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="471643">the manga is funnier, but here the music was divine. I watched this one at least six times. There is nothing more entertaining to watch than a shounen with a main character that succeds in the end.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="519715">As the tags say, it`s a great motivational show about an average boy who gets into music and it changes his life.  The only problem is that this show came out when the manga was around halfway done.  Episode 26 feels very rushed and the ending feels lacking.  There are no major cliffhangers but lots of abridged content and unanswered questions.  If you enjoy the show as much as I did, you`ll almost have to go find the manga to complete the story.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="185992">A very interesting story about a boy and his struggle to become accepted by others and the road he paves toward his dream. It has some inspiring moments and a pinch of romance to keep things lively and fun. It has a strong emphasis on school life and music. If that isnt a barrier of entry for you then you most certainly will have a fun ride with this series.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="414588">Terrible engrish singing but if you can get past that, this is a must see, specially if you liked Kids on the Slope or Nana</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="38418">if you like music and a well structured story that grow around complex characters...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="616779">Beck. It`s hard to describe what happens with this show - i guess it feels like a music lullaby ... it is emply yet pretty nice with enough substance to grip you in... The animation is akward, the songs arent always great, the main character is often discouraging... but somehow this show pulls it off together , its a nice music shonen border line drama,  that somehow will  take you back into the Nostalgia of your school days ... Few thing are to be highlighted: few show are capable of being timeless and to  breaks cultural barrier .. this one seems to do it ... also I m not a romance guy , yet i cant help to remark that this show hit the mark especially on the Innocent Romance mixed in this music group story...its simple and sometime you want to slap those young fools, but it works and feels true without being corny ... overall i dont think it will talk to everyone but it is a good music  show - worth the try.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="97876">In case you want to see a vivid and colourful, complicated yet simple, straightforward characters, believable emotions and anxieties, watch this.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="329320">Love this anime :D</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="319333">Awesome anime, the music is great and you`ll love this for sure. Nice characters and the chemistry between them makes this anime 26 enjoyable episodes. This is a must watch anime for sure =)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="138790">Anime filled with an cute love story and nice characters, but the main thing to watch this show for is the GREAT music!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="257568">Absolutely brilliant anime. No big robots, no fantasy, just real life.&lt;br /&gt;Character base is awesome + it has really nice OST.&lt;br /&gt;IMO absolute Must See for every mature anime fan.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="242315">For fans of modern music, this is a definite must see.  Get the english dub, its much better both song and voice-wise.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="257822">Greatest music anime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="278873">Must watch!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="173819">This is, without a doubt, my favorite anime. This is one of those rare 5% of anime that is BETTER DUBBED! The music is incredible. It`s a coming of age story. A story about fighting the man. A story about making your way in the world. A story about striving for greatness. Must watch. And the manga goes even futher.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="12332">If only authors put more effort into visual part of the show and did not disturbed the story with some unnecessary, overdrawn elements it would be a complete masterpiece. The problems with the story are minor ones, worth to be mentioned but not to deliberate them, but why oh why it is so ugly drawn? It is so crappy you could easily believe it was made in Hanna-Barbera! That is just a shame, since everything else is great. It has very interesting characters and decent, quite realistic and really appealing story with touch of little harsh but overall nice romance. The show is about music and music in it is really awesome and you just can feel the emotions of the live performances throughout it. All that is capable to nail you to your sit and want to watch it all at once. So despite the ugliness of the artwork it is still and definitely a must see!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="263947">Nice music/band anime. Nice characters and good storytelling, no over exaggerating just plain good.</recommendation>

<name>delinquent</name>
<description>Delinquents - Every school has them, but not all anime with school setting make delinquents a central topic. There are several versions of these delinquents, though some are grounded on a misunderstanding:
* The student with a really bad image and attitude, based on his real criminal actions outside of the school and is even feared by teachers.
* The primitive "class bully" that pushes around ("clobbers") his classmates for no apparent reason, possibly extorting lunch money.
* The student with an sinister complexion or "evil eye", but is actually a "good" student (unfoundedly feared character).
* The rebellious student, who does not care for studying, but is otherwise docile. Called a "delinquent" as a joke.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Even though school clubs in Japan are not mandatory, there is some pressure from the social grid (e.g. fellow students, teachers) to participate in some kind of after-school activity, be it in sports or arts. Colleges also have clubs.
As a comedy element in anime, some students have joined too many clubs, and are thus constantly stressed out. There is also the element of social commentary, making it clear that you have to join a club, if you want to be part of the class. Since self-founded clubs need at least 3 members, the desperate search and advertising for new members can be cause for hilarity in anime.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>coming of age</name>
<description>In the strict sense the Coming of age describes a young person`s transition from adolescence to adulthood. In anime the term is used in a more general sense where the protagonists have to face a challenge, make an important decision in their life, take on responsibility, or learn a lesson, and by overcoming these obstacles they reach a higher level of maturity.</description>

<name>rock music</name>
<description>Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. Musically, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass guitar and drums. Typically, rock is song-based music usually with a 4/4 time signature using a verse-chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political in emphasis. The dominance of rock by white, male musicians has been seen as one of the key factors shaping the themes explored in rock music. Rock places a higher degree of emphasis on musicianship, live performance, and an ideology of authenticity than pop music.</description>

<description>Quite broadly used term describing a conflict, contest, struggle, or opposition of some sort.
Typical examples: The mostly comedic rivalry for the love of a protagonist in a harem anime (love polygon), the more "mindless" battles between wannabe delinquents in a school fighting anime, or the struggle between good &amp; evil in an epic conflict for world domination.</description>

<name>Engrish</name>
<description>Engrish is actually a mispronunciation of English, as can be the result of someone, who does not have English as their primary language of origin (such as Japanese or Chinese). Occasionally characters in the original Japanese dialogue version of an anime will speak in English... however; this often still requires the assistance of subtitles, for while the words are meant to be said in English, the sentence structure and letter pronunciation may still be strongly related to the person’s primary language.</description>

<description>The main protagonist, the series follows his rapid development from living an average life to becoming an outstanding guitarist. Since he is extremely polite, he cannot help but let others push him around, a possible metaphoric stereotype on the very proper and manner-conscious Japanese society. Recruited as the last member of BECK, he serves as the second and overdriven guitarist and vocalist, and has a very beautiful voice that is mostly used for Beck`s slower songs.</description>
