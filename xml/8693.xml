<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Music anime generally revolves around people concerned with music in their everyday lives. In addition they often adhere to certain genre conventions, the emphasis on training and practice in preparation for competitions, characters desire for self improvement, and pursuit of a specific goal. This is not unlike the Sports category.</description>

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Aragaki Ayase is Kirino`s best friend, and like her also works part-time as a fashion model. She is initially very prejudiced against otaku culture, being biased by the treatment of otakus in the media. When she discovers that Kirino has such proclivities she breaks off their friendship, but Kyousuke manages to reconcile them, and he manages to get Ayase to grudgingly accept that part of Kirino.</description>

<description>Kurusu Kanako is a friend to Kirino and Ayase, and like them also works as a model, but is also a budding idol and can sing and dance very well. Like Ayase she is also biased against otaku culture, but Ayase manages to trick her into cosplaying as the main character in Kirino`s favorite anime Stardust Witch Meruru for a contest, whose prize is a limited edition Stardust Witch Meruru figurine. She manages to win the contest because of her uncanny resemblance to the main character, and her ability to sing the anime`s main theme so well despite never having sung it before.</description>

<name>Saori Vageena</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Saori Vageena is one of the active female members of the anime forum that Kirino wound up frequenting, and organized the get-together in Akihabara where she met Kirino and Kuroneko for the first time. She is the peacemaker of the group, and her friendly disposition helps to defuse tensions between Kirino and Kuroneko, keeping their arguments about each other`s tastes from getting out of hand. She tends to speak in a very quirky way, always using a very polite and antiquated mode of Japanese generally heard today only in samurai movies. Not much is known about her for certain, not even her real name (Saori Vageena is her handle on the anime board and evidently a pseudonym), but brief scenes of her at home show her in what looks a large mansion, attended by maids and butlers, implying that she is very wealthy, although neither the Kousaka siblings nor Kuroneko seem to be aware of this.</description>

<description>Tamura Manami is Kyousuke`s classmate and childhood friend. She lives with her younger brother and grandparents, who are proprietors of a sweets shop a short distance from the Kousaka house.

She is rather frumpy and plain-looking and a little clumsy, but is also very kind and good-natured.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kousaka Kirino is the main heroine of the series. She is a 14-year old girl who seems normal on the outside, but is in secret a hardcore otaku obsessed with anime and visual novel eroges, especially those involving little sisters. She works part-time as a model, which is how she managed to purchase her most impressive collection of figurines, visual novels, and anime DVDs. She has a talent for writing, and loves track and field.
She is initially cold and disrespectful towards her brother Kyousuke, but after he discovers her secret hobby and he supports her in it, they gradually grow closer.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kuroneko (a.k.a. Gokou Ruri) was one of the anime otaku girls Kirino had met in a gathering organized by Saori. Though their tastes in anime and games greatly differ, they nevertheless began to be good friends. She also became a good friend to Kyousuke, and it is hinted that she may have feelings for him. As befits the Kuroneko epithet, she is usually seen wearing a black Gothic Lolita-style dress, and is sharp-tongued and antisocial.
She enters Kyousuke`s high school later in the series, and joins the Game Club at his urging, displaying her considerable talents at writing and graphic design.</description>
