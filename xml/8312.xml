<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

Other factors, such as whether they were told what they had to do, or if it was a Leonine Contract, may come into play. Even Releasing from the Promise is usually a scene of high drama.

He is initially portrayed as a detached and apathetic figure, but as the series progresses, his loyalty to his friends and students becomes increasingly apparent. Kakashi`s past has been extensively explored in the series, resulting in a gaiden being devoted to his past experiences. Kakashi has appeared in several pieces of Naruto media, including three of the four featured films in the series, all of the original video animations, and several video games.</description>

<description>Haruno Sakura is the sole female member of Team 7. Kishimoto created her as the heroine of the series, although he has admitted that he has little perception of what an ideal heroine should be. As a child, Sakura was taunted by other children because of her large forehead, a feature Kishimoto has tried to emphasize in Sakura`s appearances. She was comforted by Ino Yamanaka. As the two continued to grow, however, they became increasingly distant due to their shared affection for Sasuke Uchiha. During most of Part I, Sakura is infatuated with Sasuke, and spurns the advances of Naruto Uzumaki. After Sasuke leaves the village, she resolves to become stronger by training with Tsunade. In Part II, she displays highly developed skills from her training, and a more open disposition towards Naruto.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Tsunade, as well as her former teammates http://anidb.net/ch7213 [Jiraiya] and http://anidb.net/ch8603 [Orochimaru], is a former student of the http://anidb.net/ch8865 [Third Hokage]. She is also the granddaughter of the http://anidb.net/ch8859 [First Hokage], and so many characters in the series refer to her with the Japanese honorific "hime" (meaning "princess"). Despite her connections to past Hokage, Tsunade hates the position when she is first introduced. After her brother and boyfriend died in pursuit of their dreams to become Hokage, she lost faith in the title and the concept of dreams. She regains her faith in both after meeting http://anidb.net/ch240 [Naruto Uzumaki], who consistently overcomes any obstacle in his own dreams of being Hokage. As a result, Tsunade accepts the position of Fifth Hokage to protect http://anidb.net/ch8864 [Konohagakure] on behalf of everyone she has loved. Despite the importance of her position, Tsunade tends to avoid her duties, instead leaving them for her assistants. She will fulfil her role to address matters important to the village, and throughout Part II leads Konoha in combating http://anidb.net/ch8599 [Akatsuki]. When Konoha is invaded by http://anidb.net/ch11993 [Pain], she uses up all her energy summoning http://anidb.net/ch17274 [Katsuyu], her slug summon, to protect the villagers, and stays in a coma for a long time causing her to be dismissed as Hokage temporarily. Tsunade possesses a number of traits that set her apart from other characters in the series, such as being a compulsive gambler with terrible luck. On the rare occasions that she hits a winning streak she perceives it as a bad omen, and makes it a point to fortify her defences when it occurs. Additionally, although she is in her fifties, she constantly assumes the appearance of a twenty-year-old woman, retaining only her characteristically large breasts. Despite her odd personality Tsunade is a talented ninja; she has superhuman strength that allows her to reduce buildings to rubble and can heal injuries that most others would consider incurable. Her healing abilities are such that she has devised a method of regeneration for herself, making her all but invincible in battle. At the conclusion of Part I, Tsunade takes http://anidb.net/ch7194 [Haruno Sakura] as an apprentice, teaching her how to use both of her trademark abilities.</description>

<description>Nara Shikamaru was in the same class as http://anidb.net/ch226 [Naruto] at the Ninja academy and is now part of a team with http://anidb.net/ch8616 [Ino] and http://anidb.net/ch8617 [Chouji]. He is very laid back to the point of being lazy; he often sees missions as troublesome. He is quite close to his team leader, http://anidb.net/ch7742 [Asuma], and the pair regularly plays shougi together. Shikamaru specialises in jutsu which manipulate shadows, but his true strength lies in his ability to think up the best strategies for defeating an enemy.

<description>Akimichi Chouji is a rather large ninja who makes up one third of Team Asuma alongside http://anidb.net/ch8615 [Shikamaru] and http://anidb.net/ch8616 [Ino]. He has a very large appetite and regularly clears out http://anidb.net/ch7742 [Asuma]`s wallet when they go for Korean barbeque. Though he can always be seen eating something, he uses his size to his advantage in battle and gets exceptionally angry when anyone calls him fat. Chouji is able to utilise the ninja techniques of his family that allow him to increase the size of any part of his body.

<name>Might Guy</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Might Guy is the leader of Team Guy, consisting of http://anidb.net/ch32424 [Rock Lee], http://anidb.net/ch32420 [Hyuuga Neiji] and http://anidb.net/ch32425 [Tenten].
Guy, and by extension Lee, lives his life by his own "My Rules" philosophy, which involves setting tougher self-imposed penalties for failure so something good comes of it. For example, he vowed to walk 500 laps around Konoha on his hands if he lost a contest with Kakashi, and proceeded to do so upon losing, even though people eventually stopped paying attention. He also doesn`t hesitate to do things he doesn`t enjoy or that others might find embarrassing if it means his own self-improvement, as seen with his belief that one cannot dislike food regardless of its ingredients or taste. In addition, Guy values his youth to a great degree and dislikes the idea that he may not be as young as he once was. To help remedy this problem he spends large amounts of time with his younger teammates, hoping to acquire some of their youthful properties. Likewise, he often refers to himself as "Konoha`s Prideful Green Beast".
Guy is the self-proclaimed rival of http://anidb.net/ch7248 [Kakashi Hatake]. Kakashi, however, is indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys Guy to no end. Kakashi also seems to have a habit of unintentionally ignoring Guy when Guy is lecturing him, which usually results in Guy asking himself why Kakashi "has to act so cool". Guy randomly challenges Kakashi to contests of skill, and has acquired a record of 50 wins and 49 losses in doing so.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Killer Bee is a ninja from the village of Kumogakure. He is introduced during Part II as one of the two hosts that have yet to be captured by the criminal organization Akatsuki, the other being series protagonist http://anidb.net/ch226 [Uzumaki Naruto]. The host of the ushi-oni-like http://anidb.net/ch14124 [eight-tailed beast], Killer Bee has complete control over the beast sealed within him. In battle he uses its great strength to increase the lethality of his professional wrestling-styled attacks. He is also a talented swordsman capable of using up to seven swords at once. Killer Bee is the brother of http://anidb.net/ch16171 [Aa], the current Raikage of http://anidb.net/ch12205 [Kumogakure], and as such is expected to be the guardian of the village. When Akatsuki attacks him, he pretends to be captured to escape this job and pursue a career as an enka music singer.</description>

As it is hinted that Killer Bee is a member of the Yotsuki clan, A is likely a member, as well. Knowing http://anidb.net/ch7721 [Nii Yugito]`s and Killer Bee`s immense powers if they were to ever transform into their full demon forms, he forbade at least Killer Bee from doing so.</description>

He is a young, dark-skinned Kumo-nin with short, spiky, white hair. He is always seen sucking on a lollipop. As a sword user he carries his sword on his back with the one strapped Kumo Flack Jacket.
He has amazing speed, and is able to move around the battlefield in the blink of an eye. His taijutsu skill is good, being able to move around fluidly with his teammates. He also uses swordplay in his fighting style, like many Kumogakure shinobi.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Karui is a kunoichi of http://anidb.net/ch12205 [Kumogakure], and a member of Team Samui. The team was sent to http://anidb.net/ch8864 [Konoha] by the http://anidb.net/ch16171 [Fourth Raikage] to inform them that they would be taking care of http://anidb.net/ch7719 [Uchiha Sasuke] and http://anidb.net/ch8599 [Akatsuki]. She, along with the other two members of her team, are http://anidb.net/ch13998 [Killer Bee]`s students.
She seems to have a somewhat comedic-negative relationship with her teammate, http://anidb.net/ch16825 [Omoi]. During their debut, they argued over the possible reasons that they could have been called by the Raikage. She assumed that he wanted them to get him more protein shakes. However, the argument started with Omoi implying that she is flat-chested in comparison to their teammate, Samui. However, like the rest of her team, she highly respects Killer Bee.
She is also quite outspoken and allows her emotions to let out, as she angrily yelled at Team Kakashi to allow the renegade Sasuke to run loose. She came to a violent point when she took out her rage on http://anidb.net/ch226 [Naruto] and beat him.</description>

As opposed to her two talkative teammates, Samui is mature, calm, and generally silent, only speaking when needed.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The http://anidb.net/ch16171 [Fourth Raikage]`s assistant acts as a go-between for the Raikage and http://anidb.net/ch12205 [Kumogakure]`s forces, giving them his orders and keeping him updated on their progress.
She`s a dark-skinned girl who is seen wearing a very formal attire during work hours, long earrings, and properly pulling her hair back into a bun except for the frontal part of it, which consists of two flat side bangs that fall along the sides of her face.
She remains calm in stressful situations and immediately completes the tasks she is given. Furthermore, she, like Darui, appears to be quite annoyed every time the Raikage bursts through walls whenever the use of doors is required, and even suggests that he`s broken through his office windows on more than one occasion.</description>

<description>Muku was a Kusagakure shinobi that appears in Naruto 5: Blood Prison.
Muku lost his mother as a baby and was raised by his father, Mui, the guardian of the Box of Ultimate Bliss. He was regarded as a prodigy of his village and, therefore, his chakra was chosen to open the box in hopes of returning Kusagakure to its former glory. The day before it happened, Muku promised his best friend, Ryuuzetsu, that he would return no matter what happened. Unfortunately, Muku`s chakra wasn`t enough and he was sucked into the box instead where he spent ten years trapped in despair and grief.
