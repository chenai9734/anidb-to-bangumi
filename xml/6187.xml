<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="278370">This series is... Different, at least given its intentional demographic target of children. Very flawed in its way and can probably only be enjoyed by the specially interested, but taking a quick look at the first five episodes shouldn`t kill anyone.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="181366">Hearth-taking fantasy anime with slow plot development, simple but nice animation and realistically written characters (no super-heros). Also dividing the plot into three timespans makes this anime a bit unique.  And the less you know about the story (beware trailers and AMV), the better enjoyment you will get.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="122157">Not a typical anime for the general audience. But one of great storyline and character development. Having said so, this was screened on NHK-E, so this carries certain level of family and heart-felt emotions during the course of the story. Great for those who are into plot and character development than action.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="172977">Starts slow as its been said, but that actually helps to get into the story. Although it has 1 recap or 2 that could be avoided and the ending could be better for this anime. Really recommended</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="250429">Very well done tragedy. Never thought I would be interested in such a thing, but gives me a better feeling than a typical classic Disney movie.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="320398">Dropped once,but then got back and really liked it.Supreme music and a nice theme,though the art can be better(I.G. were lazy).</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="122200">The story to this anime was just phenomenal...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="396387">not the usual fantasy with unfuckable-main-character-only-fighting thing. feelings are strong in this. I strongly recommend the watch to everyone who can watch things different from dragonball :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="374795">Masterpiece. Do not miss this one!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="36636">Quite slow at first; but develops into a very interesting story. Reminds me of The Twelve Kingdoms.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="124399">the series had way too many recycled cut scenes that i ended up skipping over towards the end because i wanted to know how the plot progresses. the story and character development of erin is a master piece. take your time and enjoy.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="161106">Music that soothes, story that moves and a perfect balance in storytelling which gives you a solid ride for 50 episodes. Kemono no souja Erin is filled with warm emotions and sadness, and the pacing is gentle but still steadily builds up to the climax.

No loose ends, this is a perfect example of how to direct an anime. It`s simply a masterpiece.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="60478">Epic, beautiful, great story, must see!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="371670">I`ve never seen better anime depicting human x animal relationship with such a strong female lead and especially topic of using beasts in a war. Although the show gets annoying sometimes because of all those recaps and slow-pacing, it is highly recommended. ;)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="117976">Perfect</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="418191">At first I was reluctant because it seems focused to a pretty young audience. But when I read it shares novelist with Moribito I gave it a try.
Veredict: masterpiece</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="470521">A show feeling similar with animes like "Guardian of the Spirit" or "Twelve Kingdoms" and as great as them.
Don`t be fooled and judge by the title picture on this site ;)</recommendation>

<description>* Based on the fantasy novel series written by http://anidb.net/cr6977 [Uehashi Nahoko].
Kemono no Souja Erin is about a young woman who is drawn into a war between kingdoms.
10-year-old http://anidb.net/ch7452 [Erin] is a young girl who lives with her mother in the Tai Koh Region in the small Village of Ake. She has a big love for animals, especially the Touda, dragon-like creatures used in the war.
Her mother http://anidb.net/ch7453 [Soyon] was originally of the Mist People, an ancient clan who have members with green hair and eyes, and is rumored to follow in the ancient ways, practice magic, and hide in the mist. But despite her genealogy, they stay in the village because Erin`s late father was the son of the village chief and Soyon is the head Touda doctor.
One day however a tragedy happens which changes Erin`s life forever.</description>

<description>An energetic character, often also called a genki character, shows great, often excessive levels of activity or vitality, and seems to always be doing everything extra fast. Genki characters are often slightly, or sometimes very, eccentric, and are filled with confidence and determination, regardless of whether they are competent or not; in fact, they often have little to no actual competence at whatever they generally do. Although genki characters are usually played exclusively for comedy effect, sometimes they may slow down for a serious or introspective moment. The most common genki character archetype is the genki schoolgirl, who will often be late to school and run with a toast in her mouth.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>adventure</name>
<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>daily life</name>
<description>The antics of the protagonists do not take place in some exotic setting or time, but in everyday life. When not "at the job" this means getting up in the morning, making meals, house cleaning, going shopping or out to eat, visiting the bath house or spa, leisure activities in the spare time, etc. The time "on the job" for students is School Life, for others working in their profession. Daily Life is basically a synonym for everything normal, repetitive, and trivial happening to your average person.</description>

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<name>conspiracy</name>
<description>The conspiracy thriller (or paranoid thriller) is a sub-genre of the thriller which flourished in the 1970s in the US (and was echoed in other parts of the world) in the wake of a number of high-profile scandals and controversies (most notably Vietnam, the assassination of President Kennedy, Chappaquiddick and Watergate), and which exposed what many people regarded as the clandestine machinations and conspiracies beneath the orderly fabric of political life.
The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top".</description>

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<name>footage reuse</name>
<description>Footage reuse is the employment of a sequence of frames many times, generally as a side effect of a constrained anime production budget. This can happen by using the same footage once at a time, but many times over the course of the show, or by directly looping it. Types of scenes that tend to get reused include: transformations, such as those typical of superheroes or magical girls, characters that change into powered-up versions of themselves, or robots changing shape; attacks, especially when involving a series of steps that must be followed before the attack can be launched; and any kind of action that involves repeating the same movement.
This tag does not apply if the footage changes significantly between iterations. An example of that is the infamous Endless Eight arc of http://anidb.net/a6367 [the 2009 iteration of Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu]; even as the plot repeated itself, each episode of the arc showed it in different ways.</description>

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

<description>Erin is a 10-years-old girl, described as kind, collected, earnest, and very observant. Due to the influence of her mother http://anidb.net/ch7453 [Soyon], she carries a unique perspective in caring for beasts. Many people think that she is too curious, which simply gets her in trouble.
Erin is truly caring towards people and animals, even to the point of worrying more about others than herself. She is strongly against using the Touda for war and dreams that one day humans and beasts may understand each other and that beasts would not be bound by human`s codes.

<description>Ial is one of the http://anidb.net/ch16877 [Queen]`s personal bodyguards, the Sezan, and also one of the few the Royal Family trusts personally. He takes his job, protecting the Queen and http://anidb.net/ch16876 [the Princess], very seriously.
He is known throughout the nation as "Godspeed Ial" for his ability to run at an inhuman pace.
Ial acts cold and unsociable around others, even to his comrades and http://anidb.net/ch16937 [his mentor]. However he has a soft spot for http://anidb.net/ch93797 [Erin], who is the only person he mostly smiles at and knows of his past. For her safety, he tries to keep his distance from her.
He later becomes one of the few people who knows Erin`s dark past, and promises that he`ll keep quiet about it until the time is ready. There are hints showing that Ial seems to be in love with Erin.</description>
