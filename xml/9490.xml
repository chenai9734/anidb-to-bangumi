<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="518865">Saki, in and of itself, is a surprisingly addicting Anime. All three seasons flow rather well and, while Achiga-hen felt a little rushed, the main story doesn`t feel as such. It draws you in and leaves you wanting more.</recommendation>

<name>moe</name>
<description>Moe is a Japanese slang loanword that refers to feelings of strong affection mainly towards characters in anime, manga, and video games. Moe, however, has also gained usage to refer to feelings of affection towards any subject. Moe can be related to lust; however, pure lust without other feelings is considered outside its scope. The word Moe originated in the late 1980s and early 1990s in Japan and is of uncertain origin, although there are several theories on how it came into use.
At the anime level, the http://anidb.net/t7146 [cute girls doing cute things (CGDCT)] tag may also apply.

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<description>Shoujo Ai means girls love, and thus explores what happens when two girls (or women) fall in love. This is not to be mistaken for http://anidb.net/t2695 [Yuri] which is (or, at least, how this term is often used by the western audience) used in adult works. This is not; that means there is no graphic sex.
The male version is http://anidb.net/t2783 [Shounen Ai].
http://anidb.net/t7146 [Cute girls doing cute things (CGDCT)] is often mistaken as low level Yuri or Shoujo Ai. If there is no Yuri or Shoujo Ai subtext, i.e. if there is no romantic subtext, only tag CGDCT. Please note: CGDCT and yuri/shoujo ai are not mutually exclusive; it is possible to have an anime tagged both.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

Mako was introduced to mahjong at an early age as her grandfather owned a mahjong parlor and she regularly visited there (she now works there as a waitress). As a result of this, she picks up her peculiar speech manner and more importantly her special ability. Nicknamed "Spindle Territory", it allows her to memorize games she has seen or played in so as to be able to recall them in similar situations. She utilizes this when she takes her glasses off.</description>

She`s been known to play defensively and her records shows that she has never dealt into someone`s hand and is only damaged by a tsumo. Related to Komaki, she is the vessel for the last Goddess and her ability is that she can randomly collect one suit and honor tiles for each round. As such, her hands deals with big damages and this playstyle can only be on the attack, conflicting with her usual defensive playstyle. If she uses this ability she cannot return to her regular playing style until she`s been purified so she`s always careful when using this ability. She is considered by Suehara as the most dangerous player in Eisui.

<description>Suehara Kyouko is a third year at Himematsu High, plays captain position. She is usually the one that briefs the team about their opponents. She doesn`t have any special powers per se, but she is quite adept at three-player mahjong. While Hiroe comes to the table with the mentality that she`ll win, she comes to the table with the mentality that she`s going to lose. As such, she`s always very careful and calculative during the match, passing up a potential win for a higher scoring hand. She took up the challenge of facing against monsters in the captain`s position despite being a normal player and as such, Saki considers her as the most resilient player as Kyouko was able to turn a decent scoring hand into a high scoring hand against players with special abilities and win.

She has the ability to "mark" an opponent by keeping her gaze on them, so that they will not be able to complete a hand. This ability though is very fatiguing and can cause her to be on the verge of collapse afterwards. She wears a monocle and it seems to have some sort of power to it, as the lens clouds over when someone is away to win with a big hand. It also seems to react to "monster" players as it shatters due to Miyanaga Saki`s power.

<description>Anetai Toyone is a third year at Miyamori Girl`s High, plays captain position. Toyone`s most distinguishing characteristic is that she is very tall (taller than Jun), usually wears large brim hats, and has very unique eyes. Recruited from a rural area in Iwate, she possesses the "Rokuyou" abilities. One is to declare a riichi after another player declares, winning off of the initial riichi, which is known as "Senbu". This is where she gains her nickname of Right-behind-you-Toyone. Her second ability is to win when she has one tile remaining in her hand, which is known as "Tomobiki". A third ability is called "Shakkou" and this ability allows her to call dora tiles by having the surrounding two tiles (for example, in the manga, when Toyone is told to use Shakkou, Toyone calls the four of bamboos, which is a dora tile, with the three and five of bamboos). It is unknown if Toyone has other abilities related to the other "Rokuyou".
