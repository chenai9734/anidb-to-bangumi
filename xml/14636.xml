<description>The unofficial mascot of Susaki, Chiitan, has amassed a large community of followers through his stunts and the many jokes he has been driving and spreading as a video on various social media platforms. However, due to the often uneasy and violent nature of the videos, the Susaki government has increasingly distanced itself from Chiitan and has not renewed its status as a "Volunteer Tourism Ambassador Susaki" to the original (same name) Dwarf Dart.
The planned for April 3, 2019 broadcast as a TV series was canceled. Previously only a 15-second promo video was released.</description>
