<description>A cross-dressing boy who attends Ame no Kisaki as a girl as a means to win the chairmanship of both the all-male and all-female schools where his late grandmother served as the ex-chairman for both. He deeply respects and loves his grandmother and does not care about actually winning chairmanship. He simply wishes to honour his grandmother`s request. He appears to genuinely care about others though this façade is often hidden through some excuse he has crafted for himself. When Kanako first meets Mariya, she is instantly attracted to his playful femininity and kind attitude. However, Mariya turns out to be quite sadistic in nature and generally adjusts his personality to reflect whatever situation he is in.</description>
