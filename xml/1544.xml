<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="480768">This is a masterpiece! It`s one of the saddest animes I`ve seen and it`s soooo damn good. It`s really a must see. As mentioned, there`s almost full blown nudity, there`s blood and gore, so not for the lighthearted. I`d rate this a 9/10!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="244826">This is one of the most disturbing and heart breaking animes I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;Althuoth it is alot of blood and ecchi it is still a very entertaining anime to watch.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing in this anime that I really can`t get a grip on is how easy it was for the main character-Kouta to forgive Lucy for her evil deeds towards him.&lt;br /&gt;A grade from 1-10, I would give it a 7.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="371810">One of the best anime`s ever</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="485629">Stylistic to the point of emotionally binding;  those that have made a bond with the different aspects of this anime cannot forget it (this coming from a diverse and hearty resume of watched titles).  I was so enthralled I had to include a pit stop to Vienna Austria when I was in EU to see the original art used in the OP by Gustav Klimt.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="188437">Bloodly Recommended</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="420198">Very good anime, if you love anime this anime should ring a bell, very cool limbs being torn very gruesome action and psycological</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="590577">This is great series and very touching.

Although I wouldn`t recommend this to children and people who get upset easily or have weak nerve as Elfen Lied is one of the most psychologically violent anime I have seen.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="284037">First thing, this anime contain extreme violence &amp; ecchi. There are a lot, seriously, a lot of blood and limbs being took off every now and then. In the beginning, it does seem violence, but since it occur too often, you`ll get used to it. It doesn`t seem violence anymore. You can almost expect when to see flying limbs anytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the storyline is good. Nothing horror in particular, just plain violence. I think this anime is lil overate, but great to watch. Ecchi is too cheap though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, for otaku (like me), a must watch. For mediocre :p, highly recommended. May not be the best anime, but worth your time.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="433878">Sadness, joy, hate, love, revenge, forgiveness.
All of these elements intensified by extreme violence and a haunting soundtrack.
I really didn`t see it coming, but this show really left a strong impression on me.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="762811">add a second season, I ask you</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="407096">In short, a masterpiece!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="469237">Thrill, , sadness, agony, laughter, sympathy. All these are the feelings I felt after watching on this marvelous series. Totally recommended, It`s my favourite series so far, I almost cried at the end.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="121673">Dark, violent, yet very cutesy at times. An odd, unexpected mix. This show sort of opened my eyes to anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="293382">Definitely a Must See.  One of the best anime I have ever seen.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="821880">Violent and bloody as all hell, fairly dark as well, but a gripping and compelling storyline. The anime diverges in the ending from the manga, but I didn`t hate the alternate ending.

A gory roller coaster from start to finish.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="439776">in my opinion Elfen Lied is a true must see.
this anime is not afraid of pointing some of the true horrors that exist in our world covering it up with an exelent story.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="431242">The opening of this anime immedietly creates a prejudice with most people. Watch through the first few episode with a bit of a wince and you`ll find a great romantic comedy with spots of violence for the guys.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="555526">MASTERPIECE. It`s a must-see if you`re an anime fan.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="372851">This is a very good example of Violence and Gore. This anime started not so good but as time went on, so did the anime.

If you like gore and depressing animes then watch this!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="346737">Will keep u watching from beginning to end, so epic and tragic, have to watch it at least once... or 10 times =)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="468351">this is one of the only animes that has made me feel both sad and happy. a brilliant piece of imaginitive art, a definate must see for anyone who doesnt mind a lot of blood.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="556547">best anime ever!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="283540">After a long time of not watching any anime, this was the one that dragged me back into it. If you can take a little violence and are willing to enjoy a quite depressing story you will really like this masterpiece</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="623957">I was touched on how a beautiful story can exists inside a horrible world of Elfen Lied. This probably one of my most favorite anime of all time.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="430077">A great anime with a lot of gore but worth seeing. Don`t think the story isn`t good only because gore is involved because you`d be mistaken.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="543946">Depressing but a lovely depressing anime to see . The ending is not at the lvl of quality the anime had during all episodes but read the manga and u`ll love the story even more</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="281330">Liked it very much.&lt;br /&gt;It has everything :blood,love. :P&lt;br /&gt;Highly adictive :D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="502506">It is a must! The gore and ecchi are abundant but don`t let that get in the way of the story as they add quite an effect to it! Definately not for the light hearted and you have to be in a particular mood, nostalgic sad or just generally depressive and violent, you will be glad and feel something change with in you after completing this show! Save a rewatch for as long as you can :D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="542149">Best anime I`ve ever watched! Story is perfect and pretty sad that they`ve never continued it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="324595">Excellent but... the ending is ......... meh

Read the manga and be amazed.. :]..</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="504638">It`s already a classic by this point, but it`s always good to remember how masterfully Elfen Lied can build an amazing plot combining ecchi and gore in only 13 episodes. At first I thought I wouldn`t like it as much as the hype told me, but when I saw the first episode I was amazed. Ended up watching all of it in one day.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="527292">Okay we obviously all know bout the gore, but thats just an added element that makes this anime so unique and my personal favorite.
You look past that and you see one of the most heart throbbing and poetic romances around. Reminds me of Romeo and Juliet in away. So if your thinking about watching this dont listen to the few people who are ignorant and dont understand the deeper and bigger picture to this show just watch it with a open mind and you will be satisfied through and through.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="324300">Second anime I ever watched. Many years, and many anime later, this is still at the top of my favourites. Too many people discard this as a bloody, fanservice filled anime but there is a whole lot more going on and it`s a shame they can`t see that.</recommendation>

<description>The diclonii, otherwise known as two-horned humans, are mutants of the human species that may well be the next step in human evolution. The diclonii have horns and strong telekinetic powers represented by arms. However, with this great power, they could easily destroy the human race.
Fearful of their power, humans quarantined the diclonii into secret research facilities to study them. However, in a freak accident, an enraged female diclonius escaped, killing many guards in the process. Interesting enough, the female escapee appears to have suffered amnesia after her escape, and floated to Yuigahama of Kamakura city. There, she meets http://anidb.net/ch4890 [Kouta] and http://anidb.net/ch4891 [Yuka]. They name her http://anidb.net/ch4899 [Nyuu], and decide that they all should live together.</description>

<name>moe</name>
<description>Moe is a Japanese slang loanword that refers to feelings of strong affection mainly towards characters in anime, manga, and video games. Moe, however, has also gained usage to refer to feelings of affection towards any subject. Moe can be related to lust; however, pure lust without other feelings is considered outside its scope. The word Moe originated in the late 1980s and early 1990s in Japan and is of uncertain origin, although there are several theories on how it came into use.
At the anime level, the http://anidb.net/t7146 [cute girls doing cute things (CGDCT)] tag may also apply.

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>amnesia</name>
<description>The character suffers from some kind of amnesia (memory disturbance or loss). This may mean inability to memorize new information, or inability to recollect old memories. Since there are many types of memory, the person may e.g. forget who they are but still retain learned skills.
Amnesia is fairly common in fiction as a plot device. In fact, because it allows for major plot changes while requiring little creativity from the author, it may be subject to heavy overuse.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>
</tag>
<tag id="2607" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2009-04-29">
<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>
</tag>
<tag id="2608" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2012-12-04">
<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>absurdist humour</name>
<description>Surreal humour, also known as absurdist humour, is a form of humour predicated on deliberate violations of causal reasoning, producing events and behaviours that are obviously illogical. Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, non-sequiturs, irrational or absurd situations, and expressions of nonsense.
The humour arises from a subversion of audience`s expectations, so that amusement is founded on unpredictability, separate from a logical analysis of the situation. Its appeal stems from the fact that the situation described is exceedingly ridiculous or unlikely.
On an analytical level, all jokes contain a certain amount of incongruity, but while regular jokes carry an incongruity that the audience accepts as compatible with expectations, absurd jokes are characterized by a disproportionate amount of it, with the punch line delivering a situation incompatible with the world as we know it and failing to resolve the matter in the audience`s eyes.

<description>Large breasts are breasts a fair notch larger than average, as found in some adolescent girls or fully grown women; however, as anime has no upper limit to breast size, the definition applies somewhat differently. To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>violent retribution for accidental infringement</name>
<description>A comedy / slapstick element often found in Ecchi anime: The hilarity derives from spontaneous embarrassment, overreaction of the "victim" (girl), immediate retribution for a seemingly inappropriate act, and a sense of pity with the supposed "aggressor" (boy).
Typically a boy will - through no fault of his own - stumble into a girl, thus invading her personal space. In the process the boy may e.g. pull down her skirt, grab the girl`s breasts, or accidentally kiss her. Any level-headed girl would see the accident just for what it is. Not so the girl with an overly developed sense of modesty, and a thing for violence. She - often a tsundere - will clobber the boy with excessive brutality.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<name>important haircut</name>
<description>When a character cuts off his or her hair, it often symbolizes a rite of passage or bout of character growth. A princess striking out on an adventure, or a new recruit at boot camp, for instance. Hair is something that takes time and effort to grow, so parting with it voluntarily can be a powerful act.
This is particularly a big deal when women get haircuts. Yet in fiction, even an accidental hair slicing can leave a character with a surprisingly even cut.
In many religions (Western Christianity, Ancient Egyptian religion, and others) priests and/or monks cut/shave their hair. Roman Catholic nuns also tend to cut and mantain their hair short under their veils when they enter the nunneries. The cutting of one`s own hair is also a part of Buddhist mythology, specifically something done by Siddhartha himself early on in his path to enlightenment, so anime examples might draw from this as an allusion. There are also some cultures, including Native American and many Asians, where a person would cut his or her hair as an act of grief, disgrace, or even rebellion. In the Confucian tradition, hair (like the rest of your body) is considered a gift from your parents and may not be damaged without a very good reason. Furthermore, prisoners and psychiatric patients commonly have their heads shaved, often to prevent the spread of lice, but sometimes also as a demeaning measure.

<name>ohanami</name>
<description>Hanami (花見, lit. "flower viewing") is the Japanese traditional custom of enjoying the beauty of flowers, "flower" in this case almost always meaning cherry blossoms or ume blossoms. 
From the end of March to early May, sakura bloom all over Japan, and around the first of February on the island of Okinawa. The blossom forecast (桜前線 sakurazensen, literally cherry blossom front) is announced each year by the weather bureau, and is watched carefully by those planning hanami as the blossoms only last a week or two. 
In modern-day Japan, hanami mostly consists of having an outdoor party beneath the sakura during daytime or at night. Hanami at night is called yozakura (夜桜, literally night sakura).

<name>psycho face</name>
<description>A psycho face or comical angry face is a weird or scary face that makes the character look like a psycho. This includes, but is not limited to: popping veins, eyes with different sizes, miniature pupils, grins, evil grins, showing incredible tongue, licking something, and/or drooling.
This can result from either:

* A character trait, as in, the character`s face is structurally naturally scary looking; or
* A habit, as in, their face is NOT structurally naturally scary looking, but they like making scary faces (by virtue of their personality, for example), such as when angry.

Generally, the habit version is the most common cause for psycho faces.</description>

<name>gore</name>
<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>
