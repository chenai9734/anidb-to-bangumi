<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="468231">Of all the Gundam series is this and its successor, the best. With an interesting story and good execution, this became one of my favorites. Must admit that it`s taken some material: from past gundam series / movies, and the logic of the characters are a bit odd at times. Language is something of which I am most picky about. It must be reasonable and not make the character unnaturally stupid, but rather deepen its personality. G-Seed does not achieve this completely, but good enough.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="462759">your are destined to watch this!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="469368">I recommended this for everyone. One of my favourites...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="463724">This anime didn`t disappoint me in any segment. It kept me glued to my screen every single night till I finished it. I haven`t shed so many tears watching an anime, in a very long time. To me, it was truly emotional, cruel, thrilling and captivating. The action was superb, the romance was awesome, the tactics were so intricate that it kept my mind thinking for the whole time while watching this. Also, the soundtrack and OPs/EDs were a total hit for me! This anime doesn`t rely on comedy at all, but I didn`t miss it much here because everything else managed to fulfill my needs. I`m sure glad I watched this masterpiece!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="269894">I still consider GS my favorite mecha in 2014.</recommendation>

I know some parts or meh..but O_O it`s the best mecha anime alive. With it`s fighting scenes and wide verity of interesting mecha, Who wouldn`t want to see it X3"</recommendation>

<description>Heliopolis, a so-called neutral space colony was holding a top-secret weapons research facility, producing Gundams for the Earth Alliance. ZAFT, which is composed of Coordinators (genetically modified/upgraded humans), attacks Heliopolis, stealing 4 out of the Alliance`s 5 Gundams. In the battlefield, civilian Kira Yamato stumbles upon the Strike, the last remaining Gundam of the alliance, and is forced to pilot it. In the midst of battle he encounters his best friend, Athrun Zala, as one of the hijackers of the 5 Gundams, who sides with ZAFT. Being a Coordinator, he is the only one who can pilot the Gundam. But Kira is not with ZAFT, even though they`re his own kind, nor the Alliance. Since the Alliance is the only place he could turn to at the time, he sides with them. He pilots the Gundam to protect his friends, and to fight his best friend, which pains both of them. It`s a war between individual beliefs.</description>

<description>The military, also known as the armed forces, are forces authorized and legally entitled to use deadly force so as to support the interests of the state and its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its citizens and the prosecution of war against foreign powers. The military may also have additional functions within a society, including construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding critical areas.

<description>Untrained and as yet immature, children are expediently thrust into the role of warriors to protect god, king, and country. Not having even finished school, they are inexplicably designated to elite status or roles, typically requiring months of training and years of experience.

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Racism is prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of an ethnically different background based on the pseudo-scientific belief that biological differences between peoples form so-called "races" and that one`s own "race" is superior to another, possibly also holding that members of different "races" should be treated differently. Some definitions include only consciously malignant forms of discrimination, and some views include discriminatory behaviors and beliefs based on cultural, national, ethnic, caste, or religious stereotypes. In works of fiction, this may also include similar actions against other sentient species.

The level of modification will vary from subtle changes in "look" (e.g. super-human beauty), to mental enhancements (PSI powers), to more or less atrocious adaptations to extreme environments (breath under water, radiation resistance).

<name>war</name>
<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<name>footage reuse</name>
<description>Footage reuse is the employment of a sequence of frames many times, generally as a side effect of a constrained anime production budget. This can happen by using the same footage once at a time, but many times over the course of the show, or by directly looping it. Types of scenes that tend to get reused include: transformations, such as those typical of superheroes or magical girls, characters that change into powered-up versions of themselves, or robots changing shape; attacks, especially when involving a series of steps that must be followed before the attack can be launched; and any kind of action that involves repeating the same movement.
This tag does not apply if the footage changes significantly between iterations. An example of that is the infamous Endless Eight arc of http://anidb.net/a6367 [the 2009 iteration of Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu]; even as the plot repeated itself, each episode of the arc showed it in different ways.</description>

<name>talking is a free action</name>
<description>Time in comics is flexible. Each panel shows a single event, which is usually accompanied by a length of dialog, which must take some time to say. This disparity is usually accepted if it isn`t taken to extremes.
But often, characters will exposit when it`s most needed: at the story`s climax, when both the intricacies of the plot and the intensity of action hit their highest.
While the Heroes Outrun the Fireball, Mr. Exposition might explain why the Evil Overlord`s death caused the explosion. The Action Girl can deliver impressive lectures on why the monster`s Achilles` Heel will work, while still engaging in Waif-Fu. The Superhero can quip to his heart`s content and explain his abilities while dueling one insignificant mobster, or deliver a Kirk Summation during the course of a single Finishing Move. Sometimes even apparent mere mortals can give a lecture on what is happening when it would be a much better idea to simply run like hell.
Without stopping to breathe, apparently.

<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<description>Propaganda is communication aimed at influencing the attitude of a community toward some cause or position. As opposed to impartially providing information, propaganda in its most basic sense, presents information primarily to influence an audience. Propaganda often presents facts selectively (thus lying by omission) to encourage a particular synthesis, or uses loaded messages to produce an emotional rather than rational response to the information presented. The desired result is a change of the attitude toward the subject in the target audience to further a political agenda.</description>

<gender>none/does not apply</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>The ZGMF-X10A Freedom Gundam is one of the new Gundam designs built by ZAFT. The Freedom Gundam is equipped with a wide variety of powerful weapons for use in its HiMAT (High Mobility Aerial Tactics) mode. One of these weapons is the twin "Balaena" plasma beam cannons, which are stored in the wings and mounted over the shoulders during use. The Freedom Gundam`s other main armament consists of twin hip-mounted "Xiphias" rail cannons. Other standard armaments include head vulcans, twin beam sabers and a beam rifle. The Freedom Gundam is also capable of using something far more powerful: the METEOR support system. This mobile weapons platform is designed specifically for use by the Freedom Gundam and ZGMF-X09A Justice Gundam and is stored aboard the support ship Eternal. By using the METEOR, the Freedom Gundam can deliver a blitzkrieg attack utilizing various cannons, missile launchers and two long beam swords.
The Freedom Gundam is first used in May C.E. 71 when Kira Yamato steals it with the help of Lacus Clyne. Kira uses his new suit to travel to Earth and join the battle between ZAFT and the Alliance at Alaska. Following the battle, Kira rejoins his comrades on the Archangel and travels to Orb after Murrue Ramius decides to defect from the Alliance. There, Kira fights to protect Orb from the Alliance and is later joined by his old friend and former enemy Athrun Zala piloting his new ZGMF-X09A Justice Gundam. Following the defeat of Orb, Kira returns to space and is joined by Lacus Clyne and her stolen support ship Eternal, which provides Kira with his METEOR support system. Along with Athrun, Kira uses his METEOR to save the PLANTs from destruction by nuclear missiles. At the war`s end on September 27, the Freedom Gundam is heavily damaged in a battle against Rau Le Creuset`s ZGMF-X13A Providence Gundam. After the war, the Freedom Gundam is secretly repaired and hidden in Orb. In late C.E. 73, the Freedom Gundam is reactivated by Kira to fight off a squad of UMF/SS0-3 ASH mobile suits used by a group of special ops Coordinators sent to assassinate Lacus. In early C.E. 74, PLANT Supreme Council Chairman Gilbert Durandal orders the destruction of the Archangel and Freedom Gundam after their interference in several battles between the Alliance and ZAFT. Soon after, ZAFT then initiates "Operation Angel Down," and during that battle the Freedom Gundam is destroyed by Shinn Asuka`s ZGMF-X56S Impulse Gundam.</description>

<description>While the Earth Alliance plays a game of catch up with ZAFT on mobile suit development, it also designs a new type of battleship to complement their mobile suits. Developed in conjunction with Orb`s Morgenroete company, the design of the Archangel class is based on that of Orb`s Izumo class. In addition to carrying mobile suits, the Archangel features many new technologies not seen in other Alliance vessels. The Archangel is capable of atmospheric entry, thanks to an ablative gel that can be spread across the hull. The Archangel also features laminated armor, making it very difficult to seriously damage in battle. In terms of weaponry, the Archangel is a mobile fortress. Its main weapon is the dual "Lohengrin" positron blaster cannon housed in the `legs` at the forward end of the ship. The Archangel`s armament includes an array of other weapons, such as "Gottfried" beam cannons, "Valient" linear cannons, "Igelstellung" vulcan guns as well as missile launchers.</description>

<charactertype id="3">Organization</charactertype>
<description>The military forces of the PLANTs. ZAFT is a militia made up of civilian volunteers, and the organization has no formal rank structure, so its members are instead addressed by descriptive titles like "commander" and "captain." The ZAFT forces are organized into independent teams named after their commanders, and much like the modern-day U.S. Marines these teams can operate equally well on land, at sea, in air, or in outer space. Since ZAFT`s membership is made up of genetically enhanced Coordinators, its forces are more than a match for the numerically superior Earth Alliance.
ZAFT was originally a political organization called the Zodiac Alliance, which was founded in C.E. 50 by Siegel Clyne and Patrick Zala. The Zodiac Alliance took on its present name in C.E. 65, and three years later it was reorganized to become an explicitly military organization equipped with the revolutionary new weapons known as mobile suits. The ZAFT forces are currently subject to the authority of the http://anidb.net/ch1554 [PLANT Supreme Council], and report directly to the chairman of the National Defense Committee.</description>

<charactertype id="3">Organization</charactertype>
<description>An international coalition formed by the http://anidb.net/ch1571 [PLANT] sponsor nations and their terrestrial allies to battle the forces of http://anidb.net/ch1509 [ZAFT]. The Earth Alliance is not a single political entity, but rather a collaboration between several individual nations, which regard each other as potential adversaries even though they are currently united against a common foe. The dominant powers within the Earth Alliance are the http://anidb.net/ch1594 [Atlantic Federation], the http://anidb.net/ch1595 [Eurasian Federation], and the http://anidb.net/ch1598 [Republic of East Asia], all three of which invested heavily in the construction of the PLANTs. The South African Union and the United States of South America are junior partners in the Alliance, with the latter having been forcibly annexed by the Atlantic Federation at the start of the war.
The Earth Alliance was formally established on February 7, C.E. 70, two days after final negotiations between the PLANTs and the sponsor nations were disrupted by a terror bombing at the lunar city of Copernicus. The Alliance was created as a successor to the former United Nations, whose leadership was wiped out in the Copernicus attack, and like its predecessor it`s nominally an international organization headed by a moderate secretary-general. However, in practice it`s little more than a military alliance dominated by the Atlantic Federation and its fellow PLANT sponsor nations.
The Earth Alliance is headed by a moderate Secretary-General, but the real leaders of the Earth Alliance are http://anidb.net/ch1579 [Blue Cosmos] and its http://anidb.net/ch1578 [Logos] benefactors.
At the beginning of C.E. 71, the Alliance is headquartered at the JOSH-A Base in Alaska. At the beginning of C.E. 71 its other major strongholds include the Kaohsiung spaceport in Taiwan, the Panama spaceport in Central America, the Victoria spaceport in eastern Africa, and the Ptolemaeus Lunar Base. After the destruction of JOSH-A and the Ptolemaeus Base in the first war, their functions are transferred to Heavens Base in Iceland and the Arzachel Lunar Base.</description>

<description>The executive committee which governs the PLANTs and controls the ZAFT forces. The dozen members of this supreme council serve as elected representatives of the twelve sectors, or "cities," into which the PLANTs are grouped. The council itself meets at Aprilius One, the administrative capital of the PLANTs.
Each member of the council is assigned to one of its five specialized committees - Administrative, Diplomatic, Judicial, Legislative, or National Defense. Each of these committees has its own chairman, and the overall council is chaired by a Supreme Council chairman. The council is also divided along political lines, with a roughly even split between radicals who seek to escalate the war, and moderates who hope to end the conflict through negotiation.</description>

<description>A new type of space settlement, created chiefly by Coordinators. Roughly 120 of these constructs are gathered at Lagrange point 5, a gravitationally stable area in Earth orbit, and these settlements have become a new homeland for Coordinators fleeing the persecution they experienced on Earth. As their name suggests, the PLANTs were created to serve as research and manufacturing sites, but their unique design also enables them to recreate a lush natural environment, with abundant vegetation and open water.
These hourglass-style structures consist of two disc-shaped living areas, each ten kilometers in diameter, which rotate around a central hub to produce artificial gravity. Each living area is anchored to the hub by a 30-kilometer central shaft and a network of high-tension strings, and a high-speed elevator runs up the central shaft to provide access to the hub. A set of external mirrors, attached to the central hub, are used to reflect sunlight into the inner surfaces of the living areas.
The PLANTs are grouped into twelve sectors, or "cities," each with its own scientific or industrial speciality. These cities are named after the months of the Roman calendar, and each is made up of roughly ten individual PLANT settlements, which are referred to as Januarius One, Januarius Two, and so forth.
The construction of the PLANTs began in C.E. 38, with funding supplied by the Atlantic Federation, the Eurasian Federation, and the Republic of East Asia. The PLANT settlements were initially managed by a directorate controlled by these sponsor nations, but in C.E. 53 their inhabitants formed a http://anidb.net/ch1554 [PLANT Supreme Council] to represent them in their dealings with the directorate. With the start of open hostilities between the PLANTs and the Earth Alliance in C.E. 70, the PLANTs effectively became an independent nation, governed solely by the http://anidb.net/ch1554 [Supreme Council].
After the first war between Earth and the PLANTs, the citizens of the PLANTs adopt a new name for their space settlements to reflect their independent status, and this acronym is redefined to mean People Liberation Acting Nation of Technology.</description>

<charactertype id="3">Organization</charactertype>
<description>A semi-nationalized munitions company based in the http://anidb.net/ch1501 [Orb Union], which also maintains facilities at the resource satellite Heliopolis. Although its primary clients are the armed forces of the neutral nation Orb, Morgenroete has been secretly collaborating with the Atlantic Federation on its Gundam development project and on the construction of the warship Archangel. On January 20, C.E. 71, five prototype Gundam mobile suits are rolled out at the company`s Heliopolis factory, and five days later the facility is attacked by http://anidb.net/ch1509 [ZAFT] commandos, drawing http://anidb.net/ch1 [Kira Yamato] and his friends into the conflict.
Beam weapons, second-generation mobile suit operating systems, the Lohengrin positron blaster cannon (later adapted by ZAFT as the Tannhäuser installed in the bow of the assault ship Minerva), Variable Phase Shift Armor and the Mirage Colloid cloaking device were all developed at Morgenroete either entirely or in part during the war or immediately after, partly under the aegis of chief designer Erica Simmons. More esoteric technologies were also developed at Morgenroete under the aegis of the Sahaku twins, including energy-draining weaponry.</description>

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>With the outbreak of war, the Earth Alliance`s Atlantic Federation begins a secret project to develop mobile suits to counter ZAFT`s mass-produced ZGMF-1017 GINN as well as operate free of interference from the N-Jammers. The GAT-X105 Strike Gundam is one of five initial prototype suits secretly developed in conjunction with Orb`s http://anidb.net/ch1576 [Morgenroete] defense company. Whereas the other Gundams are designed for specific roles, the Strike Gundam is intended to operate in various configurations through the use of Striker packs. Like the other prototype Gundams, the Strike Gundam is equipped with the new Phase Shift (PS) armor technology. When in Phase Shift mode, the Strike Gundam is nearly impervious to attacks from shell-firing artillery or melee weapons. However, use of Phase Shift for extended periods of time is a massive drain on the energy battery. The basic version of the Strike Gundam is nearly identical to the GAT-X102 Duel Gundam`s initial configuration. Its armament consists of two "Igelstellung" vulcan guns, a 57mm beam rifle, a shield and two "Armor Schneider" combat knives. Other optional armaments include a bazooka designed for underwater combat. In addition to the first unit, Orb later constructs an improved version from spare parts, the MBF-02 Strike Rouge. The Alliance also constructs a third unit, which is later upgraded into the GAT-X105E Strike E. The Strike Gundam is later followed by the mass production GAT-01 Strike Dagger and GAT-01A1 Dagger.
The first Strike Gundam enters combat in January 25, C.E. 71, when ZAFT attacks Orb`s space colony Heliopolis in an attempt to steal the Gundam prototypes. Although ZAFT succeeds in capturing four units, the Strike Gundam remains in Alliance control and is initially (and ineffectively) used by Murrue Ramius. However, young Coordinator Kira Yamato is able to modify the incomplete operating system and make the Strike Gundam combat ready. Following the destruction of Heliopolis, Kira becomes the Strike Gundam`s default pilot and joins the crew of the Archangel. While heading for the Alliance`s Alaskan headquarters, the Strike Gundam is severely damaged in battle on April 17 by Athrun Zala`s self-destructing GAT-X303 Aegis Gundam. The Strike Gundam is later repaired by Orb and passed on to ace pilot Mu La Flaga, while Kira upgrades to ZAFT`s ZGMF-X10A Freedom Gundam. The Strike Gundam serves as Mu`s personal mobile suit after the Archangel defects from the Alliance and joins the Orb forces and Clyne faction to form the Three Ships Alliance. At the war`s end on September 27, the Strike Gundam is damaged in a duel with Rau Le Creuset`s ZGMF-X13A Providence Gundam and later destroyed while Mu is protecting the Archangel from an attack by the Alliance battleship Dominion. Two years after the war, the versatile design of the Strike Gundam serves as the basis for ZAFT`s ZGMF-X56S Impulse Gundam.</description>

<description>The most radical of the anti-Coordinator activist groups formed by resentful Naturals. According to the Blue Cosmos ideology, genetic modification is a violation of the natural order, and all Coordinators must be exterminated "for the preservation of our blue and pure world."
Blue Cosmos was originally an environmental pressure group, but after the revelation of George Glenn`s secret in C.E. 15, the organization launched a campaign of terror and assassination against Coordinators and the medical professionals who were working to create them. It is believed that the group is supported by the Azrael Conglomerate, a powerful industrial concern which is one of the Atlantic Federation`s major military contractors.
After the first war between Earth and the PLANTs, Lord Djibril becomes the new leader of Blue Cosmos, and the organization continues to create conflict between Naturals and Coordinators.</description>

<description>This nation is the dominant power in the http://anidb.net/ch1542 [Earth Alliance], and the creator of the http://anidb.net/ch1507 [Archangel] and the prototype Gundams. Before the war, the Atlantic Federation was the most influential of the sponsor nations which funded the construction of the http://anidb.net/ch1571 [PLANTs] and then forced their Coordinator inhabitants into economic bondage. When the leadership of the United Nations was wiped out by a terror attack at the lunar city of Copernicus, the Atlantic Federation took the lead in organizing the http://anidb.net/ch1542 [Earth Alliance] and issuing a declaration of war against the http://anidb.net/ch1571 [PLANTs].
The Atlantic Federation was originally formed from the nations of Britain and North America. At the beginning of the first war it expanded its territory by annexing the http://anidb.net/ch1601 [United States of South America], but this conquest is eventually undone when the Junius Treaty restores South America`s independence.
During the first war the Atlantic Federation`s major military base, the JOSH-A facility in Alaska, doubles as the headquarters of the Earth Alliance forces. After the destruction of JOSH-A, its functions are transferred to Heavens Base in Iceland.</description>

Among its strategic assets is the space fortress Artemis, located at Lagrange point 3.
When a new war breaks out between Earth and the PLANTs, the Eurasian Federation once again sides with the Atlantic Federation. Meanwhile, its citizens become increasingly vocal in their demands for independence. As the war continues, ZAFT forces begin to intervene on behalf of these independence movements, liberating their homes and cities from Eurasian Federation control.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Haro is the mechanical mascot of the Gundam science fiction anime metaseries, and is the only character that appears in more than one timeline.
The original Haro is a little robot companion built by the main character Amuro Ray. It is a cute testament to Amuro`s exceptional talent for machines. Haro`s features include a limited range of speech, and the ability to hover (in environments with atmosphere and low gravity) by flapping its ear-like appendage coverings. Haro can usually be found rolling behind Amuro`s next door neighbor Frau Bow. The ability to detect brain waves is also one of Haro`s functions; in one of the episodes, Haro actually claimed that the brain wave of Amuro was lowered/different.
In Zeta Gundam, a mass-produced Mk-II version of Haro ends up in the hands of that series` main protagonist Kamille Bidan, who initially suspects it to be the original. He repairs the robot, only to have it constantly address him as Amuro.
During the events of Char`s Counterattack, Amuro gives a "third-generation" Haro to Hathaway, the son of his captain Bright Noa.
Haro continues to permeate the Gundam franchise, having appeared in Gundam SEED as Lacus Clyne`s multi-colored horde of simple-speech robot pets, built for her by Athrun Zala. These Haros are roughly 1/4 the size of their Universal Century counterparts and are similar in function, however a few possess certain abilities such as unlocking doors. Lacus`s favorite Haro is a pink machine that she refers to as "Pink-Chan" (often translated as "Mr. Pink" or "Pinky"). Another notable Haro in Lacus`s collection is "Navy-Chan", a navy blue robot on which she paints a mustache bearing a distinct resemblance the facial ornament of the ∀ Gundam of the CC (正歴 Seireki) calendar system. The rest of Lacus` Haros have been seen in yellow, orange, blue, green, and black. The parody comic Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Club Yonkoma states that Athrun has built a total of 35 Haros for Lacus.
In Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Celestial Being had produced unknown numbers of Haros as an assistant of daily maintenance works. Currently at least 6 unique Haros have appeared in the animation production. The Haros in the series took much more maintenance and combat role than any other series` counterpart, usually seeing them operating with various machines, including mobile weapons.</description>

<description>A famous ace pilot of the Earth Alliance, who brings his Moebius Zero mobile armor aboard the Archangel after his original mothership is destroyed. Mu earned the nickname "Hawk of Endymion" by singlehandedly shooting down five ZAFT mobile suits in one of the war`s early battles. Aside from his piloting skills, tactical abilities, and extensive combat experience, Mu`s greatest contribution to the Archangel is probably the morale boost provided by his relaxed and lighthearted personality.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Rau Le Creuset is the Commander as well as a natural who constantly has to take drugs in order to help with the defects in his DNA that casues him to age rapily. He seems to be an extremely intelligent leader, but also believes that because ZAFT and Earth Alliance want to fight, they should be able to do so. In addition, Rau Le Creuset is also clone of his father, Al Da Flaga.He never appears in public without his distinctive face mask, and his actual appearance - like the nature of his apparent rapport with Earth Alliance ace Mu La Flaga - thus far remains a secret.
Created illegally as a Coordinator by Al Da Flaga while also carrying the NewType gene from his father, he is the son of Al Da Flaga, who had named him as his son over Mu La Flaga. Due to unfortunate circumstances, their house burned down and Rau Le Creuset became enlisted in the ZAFT military because of his relations to Patrick Zala. Rau Le Creuset has a bit of an aging problem that causes him to grow up and develop at a faster rate than everyone else, which is why he must take blue and white pills in order to slow down his aging process. In the ZAFT military, Rau Le Creuset becomes the commander of one of the most greatest teams of ZAFT, the Le Creuset Team, which is sometimes envied by others for their skill as they have ZAFT`s topguns in their ranks .He is a ruthless and enigmatic commander of the elite ZAFT team that attacks Heliopolis and then relentlessly pursues the Archangel. Raw Le Creuset also plays a key role in the ZAFT Military as he reports directly to Patrick Zala since Partrick`s son Athrun Zala is in his team.
While he has a somewhat a good personality on the outside, it acts like more of a veil that covers up his true intentions, which are somewhat psychotic. He desires world peace and realizes the situation between the Earth Alliance and ZAFT as they both want to destroy each other. Thus, what he believes, is that he should help them achieve that by any means necessary similar to the modern age and nuclear missiles. Once again, despite his craziness, he is very refined and reasonable on the outside in making orders.
He is extremely skilled at piloting any mobile suit or Gundam of any type and a very good strategist. He makes long term plans for his peacemaking operation throughout a large span of time, and manages to pull them off.</description>

After clashing with the Strike Gundam, Yzak becomes even more intent on defeating the Archangel and its resident mobile suit, and the injuries he sustains in battle serve to further fuel his hatred.
In Gundam SEED Destiny:
The former Duel Gundam pilot now leads the Joule Team and wears the white uniform of a ZAFT commander. As the new conflict escalates, Yzak participates in the Junius Seven demolition operation and helps defend the PLANT homeland from the vengeful Earth Alliance.</description>

Unlike Clotho and Shani, who were killed by Yzak Joule, Orga was killed during the Second Battle of Jachin Due by Three Ships Alliance pilot Athrun Zala in the ZGMF-X09A Justice equipped with the METEOR. Athrun slices Orga in half from behind as he is dodging a beam from Kira.
From flashback sequences in Gundam SEED Destiny, Shinn Asuka`s family is killed by an explosion resulting from a crossfire between Orga`s GAT-X131 Calamity, and the ZGMF-X10A Freedom. It is never made clear which mobile suit, if not both of them, is the direct cause of their deaths.</description>

<description>Sai is another friend of Kira Yamato from Heliopolis. When the colony is raided by ZAFT, he ends up with his friends on the Archangel. Sai is put in charge of enemy detection and electronic warfare identification on the CIC of the Archangel. Initially, Sai was in a relationship with Flay Allster but she breaks it off in favor of Kira, which enrages Sai to the point where he tries to move the Strike. Despite his humiliation, Sai does not try to win back Flay and comes to accept that she is with Kira, who is later reported MIA. With Kira gone, Flay attempts to restart her relationship with Sai, denying she ever felt any emotions for Kira but Sai refuses to believe her. Later, Flay is transferred from the Archangel before Operation Spit Break while Sai and the rest of the crew defect to Orb after they are saved by Kira in the stolen ZGMF-X10A Freedom. Sai makes peace with Kira, and the two of them remain on good terms for the remainder of their enlistment together. Sai continues to serve at his post on the Archangel throughout the rest of the war. During that time, he realizes Flay still cares for him in some respects when she calls his name specifically while trying to communicate with the Archangel, and he is deeply saddened when Flay dies at the hands of Rau Le Creuset. A short OVA set after the series shows him going back to a civilian life, one that apparently involves computers. He still keeps pictures of himself with Flay, despite their tumultuous history, and seems content with this new life.</description>

<description>The Forbidden Gundam is one of three new Earth Alliance prototypes deployed in the invasion of the Orb Union. Based on an X200-series frame like that of the Blitz Gundam, this machine features several unique weapons systems. Its Trans-Phase Armor and energy-deflecting Geschmeidig Panzer shields protect the Forbidden from both physical attacks and beam weapons, and by generating a magnetic field between its railguns, the Forbidden can bend the beams of its plasma cannon to make them harder to evade. It also carries a heavy scythe capable of slicing an enemy warship in half. In the hands of the biological CPU Shani Andras, this machine is as unpredictable as it is dangerous.</description>

<description>The Raider Gundam is one of three new Earth Alliance prototypes deployed in the invasion of the Orb Union. Based on an X300-series frame similar to that of the Aegis Gundam, this machine transforms into a birdlike mobile armour for high-speed flight, and in this form it can also carry another mobile suit on its back. Because the Raider is designed for close combat, its armament consists mainly of short-range beam cannons and machine guns, as well as a mace-like spherical breaker. This mobile suit is assigned to the biological CPU Clotho Buer.</description>

<description>A specialized fighter aircraft created to support the Strike Gundam. The Skygrasper is designed to carry Striker packs out into the battlefield so that the Strike can replace its equipment in mid-battle, and the fighter itself can also use the Striker packs` weapons in combat. The Skygrasper`s built-in weaponry includes a powerful beam cannon and a pair of heavy machine guns, as well as weapons bays for storing bombs and missiles. Two Skygraspers are transferred to the Archangel when it joins with the Earth Alliance`s 8th Fleet, and after the ship descends to Earth, Mu La Flaga begins using one of these atmospheric fighters in place of his Moebius Zero mobile armour.</description>

<description>The Earth Alliance`s first mass-produced mobile suit, which was based on data from the prototype Strike Gundam. The Strike Dagger`s operating system is designed for use by Naturals, making it possible for ordinary Alliance soldiers to pilot these complex machines. Its design has been greatly simplified due to the requirements of wartime production, and it thus lacks the Phase Shift Armor, Striker pack technology, and overall high performance of the original Strike. Nonetheless, these incomplete machines soon prove their worth in mass battle against ZAFT`s own mobile suit forces.</description>

Only the Kusanagi`s central module travels in and out of Earth`s atmosphere, and once in orbit it docks with the other modules to form a full-sized warship. Created by Morgenroete, this ship is similar in design to the Archangel, with lower firepower but a far greater mobile suit carrying capacity. When the Orb Union falls to the Earth Alliance, the Kusanagi carries Cagalli Yula Athha and her comrades into space, and it goes on to become the mothership of Orb`s remaining M1 Astray mobile suit forces.</description>
