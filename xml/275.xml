<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="419645">Totally masterpiece of work in mind.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="242092">Beyond Epic movie. Dynamic story with many simple yet engaging subplots. Everything is done so well and the story so refined - you could make a whole series of the "Tales of the Valley of the Wind" I finished the movie with leaving nothing wanted. Highly recommend this to anyone wanting a great film.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="283246">Great, but does not compare to the manga.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="610329">Oh)))it`s  so  wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So otaku, watch it</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="163070">As of right now I`d have to say Nausicaa is my favorite Miyazaki film.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="504638">Nausicaa is the perfect example of how good things never get truly old. It is a movie made by the earliest beginnings of Studio Ghibli, beautifully animated for the time (it`s from 1984!), with a plot that remains up-to-date. It is similar to Princess Mononoke`s concept, and shares a strong female lead. It`s amazing to see how things escalated so far and I was truly startled to watch this movie nowadays still being so deep and thoughtful. Give it a try when you have time and I`m sure you won`t be disappointed.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="417398">This is definitely one of the best works by Ghibli studio. It holds a truly beautiful story and makes you think what our future might hold. To add on, the music is fantastic.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="466317">Any work done by Miyazaki is DEFINITELY a MUST SEE! This is one of his best works.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="310626">This is not simply amazing anime, this is a brutalistic anime... Don`t miss!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="516146">If you are a Miyazaki fan, you must see this. This is his first independent movie, and is what led to the launch of Studio Ghibli. He wrote several related mangas before the movie, and the resulting demand for a movie version led to this release. It is one of my favorite Miyazaki movies.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="708257">One of my all time favorite Jiburi Movies. This movie pulls its audience into its unique story. This movie has influenced not only the anime industry but also many Hollywood movies over many years. Many producers, actors and artist have been greatly inspired by this movie. I can safely say that this film will not let you down.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="298033">Nausicaa is truly one of the best anime movies I have seen. A moving plot, characters and music, makes this movie into a true classic.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="642367">Another one of the amazing anime that I grew up watching. This is one of my all-time favorites, without a doubt. The story, characters, moral messages, animation quality, and soundtrack are all top notch. I can`t believe this movie is over 30 years old now. It still holds up over time. Defnitely one of Hayao Miyazaki`s greatest achievements. Another one of the required viewing material for all anime fans, both new and old. You don`t know what you`re missing out on. What are you waiting for? Go watch this gem already. ;)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="206351">Epic, with a strong environmental message. The setting will just blow you away with its strange plants and giant insects. Nausicaa is one of the strongest female protagonists around and one of my favorite anime characters. She flies around on a glider, too! Definitely a must see classic.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="764835">One of the best full length anime movies ever made, I watch it every couple of years for me that is the sure sign of a quality anime.</recommendation>

<description>Humanity, in its hubris, has precipitated an ecological disaster. Flourishing industrial civilizations have been swallowed up. Today, a millennium after the collapse of the industrial societies, large portions of the Earth are uninhabitable. Among those, one of the most relevant is the Sea of Corruption, an enormous forest of fungi that releases a miasma of poisonous spores into the air.
http://anidb.net/ch7803 [Nausicaa], a gentle young princess from a village-sized kingdom, has an empathetic bond with the giant mutated insects that evolved in the wake of the destruction of the ecosystem. Travelling by cumbersome flying ships, on the backs of giant birds, and perched atop her beloved glider, Nausicaa and her allies must appease the angers and fears of nations and people alike, all the while trying to convince the belligerents of the truth she has learned regarding their environment...</description>

<description>The military, also known as the armed forces, are forces authorized and legally entitled to use deadly force so as to support the interests of the state and its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its citizens and the prosecution of war against foreign powers. The military may also have additional functions within a society, including construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding critical areas.

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>mina</name>
<description>In the context of manga and associated media, the word mina refers to a broad audience, which can be said to be "the entire family", from the grumpy grandpa to the newborn baby. In Japanese, the word means simply "everyone", and has no anime/manga-related connotations at all. It does not comprise a style or a genre per se, but rather indicates the publisher`s intended target demographic. Mina works are deliberately targeted at a range of people as wide as possible, and are commonly associated with high-budget releases that require a very large audience to be financially viable. They usually bring mildly philosophical themes so that the adults can be interested, but do so without bringing objectionable content so that the children can be allowed to watch, and indeed also feature content specifically geared to spark their interest.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>adventure</name>
<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>post-apocalyptic</name>
<description>An anime that takes place on future Earth (or it could be an alternative universe) after a major cataclysm has occurred. World War III, an alien invasion, plague, global warming or some other general disaster are common themes to build a post-apocalyptic world upon, where the effects were severe enough that mankind barely survived.
The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologised). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in an agrarian, non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of technology remain. There is a considerable degree of blurring between post-apocalyptic fiction and that which deals with false utopias or dystopian societies.</description>

<name>war</name>
<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<name>environmentalism</name>
<description>Environmental protection is a practice of protecting the natural environment on individual, organizational or governmental levels, for the benefit of both the natural environment and humans. Due to the pressures of population and technology, the biophysical environment is being degraded, sometimes permanently. This has been recognized, and governments have begun placing restraints on activities that cause environmental degradation. Since the 1960s, activity of environmental movements has created awareness of the various environmental issues.

<description>You can watch this movie without having to watch something else first. This tag should not used for sequels, side stories, or summary movies, but may be used if the movie is either the first anime in a franchise or a remake.
The movie must be feature-length. For shorts, use the `short movie` tag. In general, a "show-in-show" would not qualify as standalone. For example, an anime has a cartoon show within it. If the show within was released as an OVA or movie, it would not be considered standalone.</description>

<description>Nausicaa is a charismatic young princess of the peaceful Valley of the Wind. Although a skillful fighter, she is humane and peace-loving. She has an unusual gift for communicating with the giant insects (particularly with the Ohmu who are the most intelligent creatures in the Sea of Decay). She is also noted for her empathy toward animals, humans, and other beings. An intelligent girl, and inspired by the mentor figure http://anidb.net/ch7804 [Yupa], a wandering samurai type possessed of great wisdom, Nausicaa frequently explores the Sea of Decay and conducts scientific experiments in an attempt to define the true nature and origins of the toxic world in which she lives. Her explorations are facilitated by her skill at "windriding"; flying with an advanced jet assisted glider craft called Mahve.
