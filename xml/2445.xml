<description>Two animated shorts each featuring the characters and mecha of the Astray R and Astray B manga/novel series, as well as mobile suits from the Gundam SEED MSV (Mobile Suit Variations) model kit series.
In the first short, http://anidb.net/ch53437 [Lowe Guele] and the Junk Guild make a stop at an mobile suit parts auction on Earth where Lowe purchases a head taken from a modified BuCUE suit which, when attached to the arm of his Red Frame Astray, acts as a dual beam saber. Lowe tries to decrypt some combat data contained in the head, but is shortly engaged by, and goes into combat with several ZAFT suits including a CGUE DEEP Arms.
In the second short, Blue Frame pilot http://anidb.net/ch53438 [Murakumo Gai] engages and, with the help of his fellow Serpent Tail mercenaries, traps a GINN High Mobility Type. He then faces off with the legendary http://anidb.net/ch53439 [Edward Harrelson], who pilots a Sword Calamity Gundam and has just finished destroying a fleet of ZAFT ships.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>human enhancement</name>
<description>Human enhancement can take various forms: It can be something comparatively non-intrusive as a power-up drug, a form of machine implantation or cyberization (http://anidb.net/a4414 [SAC Solid State Society]), or outright - possibly atrocious - genetic manipulation (http://anidb.net/a361 [Ao no 6 Gou]). Plot-wise enhanced protagonists in anime usually have to pay a price for their enhancements, be it physical or mental.</description>

<description>Mecha in Japanese basically means mechanical things; everything from an electric whisk or a car to a spaceship or a robot.

<name>genetic modification</name>
<description>Story-wise, genetic modification is usually centred on humans, probably the most subtle and creepy way of messing with mankind. Playing with the fear of the unknown, genetically altered humans are technically a new species, that may not only surpass but actually replace unaltered humans. The level of modification will vary from subtle changes in "look" (e.g. super-human beauty), to mental enhancements (PSI powers), to more or less atrocious adaptations to extreme environments (breath under water, radiation resistance). Note that changes in Aliens would be difficult to pinpoint, after all they are alien.</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<name>ZAFT</name>
<gender>none/does not apply</gender>
<charactertype id="3">Organization</charactertype>
<description>The military forces of the PLANTs. ZAFT is a militia made up of civilian volunteers, and the organization has no formal rank structure, so its members are instead addressed by descriptive titles like "commander" and "captain." The ZAFT forces are organized into independent teams named after their commanders, and much like the modern-day U.S. Marines these teams can operate equally well on land, at sea, in air, or in outer space. Since ZAFT`s membership is made up of genetically enhanced Coordinators, its forces are more than a match for the numerically superior Earth Alliance.
ZAFT was originally a political organization called the Zodiac Alliance, which was founded in C.E. 50 by Siegel Clyne and Patrick Zala. The Zodiac Alliance took on its present name in C.E. 65, and three years later it was reorganized to become an explicitly military organization equipped with the revolutionary new weapons known as mobile suits. The ZAFT forces are currently subject to the authority of the http://anidb.net/ch1554 [PLANT Supreme Council], and report directly to the chairman of the National Defense Committee.</description>

<gender>none/does not apply</gender>
<charactertype id="3">Organization</charactertype>
<description>An international coalition formed by the http://anidb.net/ch1571 [PLANT] sponsor nations and their terrestrial allies to battle the forces of http://anidb.net/ch1509 [ZAFT]. The Earth Alliance is not a single political entity, but rather a collaboration between several individual nations, which regard each other as potential adversaries even though they are currently united against a common foe. The dominant powers within the Earth Alliance are the http://anidb.net/ch1594 [Atlantic Federation], the http://anidb.net/ch1595 [Eurasian Federation], and the http://anidb.net/ch1598 [Republic of East Asia], all three of which invested heavily in the construction of the PLANTs. The South African Union and the United States of South America are junior partners in the Alliance, with the latter having been forcibly annexed by the Atlantic Federation at the start of the war.
The Earth Alliance was formally established on February 7, C.E. 70, two days after final negotiations between the PLANTs and the sponsor nations were disrupted by a terror bombing at the lunar city of Copernicus. The Alliance was created as a successor to the former United Nations, whose leadership was wiped out in the Copernicus attack, and like its predecessor it`s nominally an international organization headed by a moderate secretary-general. However, in practice it`s little more than a military alliance dominated by the Atlantic Federation and its fellow PLANT sponsor nations.
The Earth Alliance is headed by a moderate Secretary-General, but the real leaders of the Earth Alliance are http://anidb.net/ch1579 [Blue Cosmos] and its http://anidb.net/ch1578 [Logos] benefactors.
At the beginning of C.E. 71, the Alliance is headquartered at the JOSH-A Base in Alaska. At the beginning of C.E. 71 its other major strongholds include the Kaohsiung spaceport in Taiwan, the Panama spaceport in Central America, the Victoria spaceport in eastern Africa, and the Ptolemaeus Lunar Base. After the destruction of JOSH-A and the Ptolemaeus Base in the first war, their functions are transferred to Heavens Base in Iceland and the Arzachel Lunar Base.</description>

<name>PLANT</name>
<gender>none/does not apply</gender>
<charactertype id="3">Organization</charactertype>
<description>A new type of space settlement, created chiefly by Coordinators. Roughly 120 of these constructs are gathered at Lagrange point 5, a gravitationally stable area in Earth orbit, and these settlements have become a new homeland for Coordinators fleeing the persecution they experienced on Earth. As their name suggests, the PLANTs were created to serve as research and manufacturing sites, but their unique design also enables them to recreate a lush natural environment, with abundant vegetation and open water.
These hourglass-style structures consist of two disc-shaped living areas, each ten kilometers in diameter, which rotate around a central hub to produce artificial gravity. Each living area is anchored to the hub by a 30-kilometer central shaft and a network of high-tension strings, and a high-speed elevator runs up the central shaft to provide access to the hub. A set of external mirrors, attached to the central hub, are used to reflect sunlight into the inner surfaces of the living areas.
The PLANTs are grouped into twelve sectors, or "cities," each with its own scientific or industrial speciality. These cities are named after the months of the Roman calendar, and each is made up of roughly ten individual PLANT settlements, which are referred to as Januarius One, Januarius Two, and so forth.
The construction of the PLANTs began in C.E. 38, with funding supplied by the Atlantic Federation, the Eurasian Federation, and the Republic of East Asia. The PLANT settlements were initially managed by a directorate controlled by these sponsor nations, but in C.E. 53 their inhabitants formed a http://anidb.net/ch1554 [PLANT Supreme Council] to represent them in their dealings with the directorate. With the start of open hostilities between the PLANTs and the Earth Alliance in C.E. 70, the PLANTs effectively became an independent nation, governed solely by the http://anidb.net/ch1554 [Supreme Council].
After the first war between Earth and the PLANTs, the citizens of the PLANTs adopt a new name for their space settlements to reflect their independent status, and this acronym is redefined to mean People Liberation Acting Nation of Technology.</description>

<charactertype id="3">Organization</charactertype>
<description>A semi-nationalized munitions company based in the http://anidb.net/ch1501 [Orb Union], which also maintains facilities at the resource satellite Heliopolis. Although its primary clients are the armed forces of the neutral nation Orb, Morgenroete has been secretly collaborating with the Atlantic Federation on its Gundam development project and on the construction of the warship Archangel. On January 20, C.E. 71, five prototype Gundam mobile suits are rolled out at the company`s Heliopolis factory, and five days later the facility is attacked by http://anidb.net/ch1509 [ZAFT] commandos, drawing http://anidb.net/ch1 [Kira Yamato] and his friends into the conflict.
Beam weapons, second-generation mobile suit operating systems, the Lohengrin positron blaster cannon (later adapted by ZAFT as the Tannhäuser installed in the bow of the assault ship Minerva), Variable Phase Shift Armor and the Mirage Colloid cloaking device were all developed at Morgenroete either entirely or in part during the war or immediately after, partly under the aegis of chief designer Erica Simmons. More esoteric technologies were also developed at Morgenroete under the aegis of the Sahaku twins, including energy-draining weaponry.</description>
