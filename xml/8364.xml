<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="413731">This is a great series, its funny and all the characters are loveable</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="296499">Much better than the 1st season in my opinion, with a better flow and direction.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="492184">best Comedy :D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="162764">What a great show, switching between subtile to brute force to totally maniac humor and plot - in just a split-second. I demand a third season!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="264691">It`s WORKING !! S1 is good to me but S2 is even better. Hilarious but very sublte. The plot becomes more interesting in every episode and i laugh like an idiot.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="462633">The first season was nice, but this one is awesome. One of the greatest anime based on humor so far, in my opinion. The plot is quite weak, but it doesn`t matter since you`ll laugh a lot.
The visual art is nice, and it has a great opening song.
Most characters are quite original, and fit the anime perfectly.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="217635">GREAT Second season. A little better than the first in fact. I just wish that it would follow the manga perfectly, but nevertheless still very good anime. MUST SEE!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="15390">I don`t know why ppl say the plot is weak.  It`s very straightforward with what it is: comedy with enough plot to keep the characters relevant.  The romance isn`t overwhelming, but there`s enough to keep you interested.  It`s really funny and clever, the animation is great too.  

For romance fans, this isn`t hardcore with it.  There`s more than a sprinkle and the characters develop emotions, it won`t disappoint in that area.  It`s supposed to be lighthearted, so it won`t commit to any one genre but it does them all well.

Highly recommended.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on the Working!! 4-koma seinen manga by http://anidb.net/cr10051 [Takatsu Karino], serialised in http://anidb.net/cr23601 [Young Gangan].
http://anidb.net/ch13559 [Takanashi Souta] continues to work part-time at the Wagnaria family restaurant in Hokkaido, together with the restaurant`s high-spirited and quite eccentric staffers:
http://anidb.net/ch13561 [Inami Mahiru]`s androphobia still gets in the way of her secret crush on Souta, who in turn is taken in by the cuteness of energetic, yet undertall http://anidb.net/ch13560 [Taneshima Poplar]. And the tall blond chef http://anidb.net/ch13564 [Satou Jun] continues to tease Poplar about her height. The manipulative http://anidb.net/ch13565 [Souma Hiroomi] has dirt on everyone it seems, and uses that information to his advantage, to avoid, as he sees it, unnecessary work. The katana-carrying http://anidb.net/ch13562 [Todoroki Yachiyo] is still smitten with http://anidb.net/ch13563 [Shirafuji Kyouko], the lazy glutton of a restaurant manager.
Will Souta finally realize how Mahiru feels about him? Or Yachiyo understand why Jun is particularly friendly with her? Or will Kyouko`s delinquent past catch up with her? As that may be, serving the customers in this family-friendly restaurant always comes first...

<name>moe</name>
<description>Moe is a Japanese slang loanword that refers to feelings of strong affection mainly towards characters in anime, manga, and video games. Moe, however, has also gained usage to refer to feelings of affection towards any subject. Moe can be related to lust; however, pure lust without other feelings is considered outside its scope. The word Moe originated in the late 1980s and early 1990s in Japan and is of uncertain origin, although there are several theories on how it came into use.
At the anime level, the http://anidb.net/t7146 [cute girls doing cute things (CGDCT)] tag may also apply.

<name>tsukkomi</name>
<description>A tsukkomi is a comedy duo stock character in a traditional Japanese slapstick stand-up comedy style known as manzai. Tsukkomi characters are the smart, reasonable, and down-to-earth half of the unit; their simple-minded counterparts are the http://anidb.net/t1399 [boke] characters. As a result of their boke counterparts` simple mistakes and gross exaggerations, tsukkomi berate and abuse them both verbally and physically; a very common example of tsukkomi physical abuse is a paper fan slap, which is generally accompanied by a sound effect. Their approximate equivalent in Western culture is the comedy role of straight man.</description>

<name>energetic</name>
<description>An energetic character, often also called a genki character, shows great, often excessive levels of activity or vitality, and seems to always be doing everything extra fast. Genki characters are often slightly, or sometimes very, eccentric, and are filled with confidence and determination, regardless of whether they are competent or not; in fact, they often have little to no actual competence at whatever they generally do. Although genki characters are usually played exclusively for comedy effect, sometimes they may slow down for a serious or introspective moment. The most common genki character archetype is the genki schoolgirl, who will often be late to school and run with a toast in her mouth.</description>

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>violent retribution for accidental infringement</name>
<description>A comedy / slapstick element often found in Ecchi anime: The hilarity derives from spontaneous embarrassment, overreaction of the "victim" (girl), immediate retribution for a seemingly inappropriate act, and a sense of pity with the supposed "aggressor" (boy).
Typically a boy will - through no fault of his own - stumble into a girl, thus invading her personal space. In the process the boy may e.g. pull down her skirt, grab the girl`s breasts, or accidentally kiss her. Any level-headed girl would see the accident just for what it is. Not so the girl with an overly developed sense of modesty, and a thing for violence. She - often a tsundere - will clobber the boy with excessive brutality.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>Boobs in your face: the character`s face is pressed into a female`s cleavage. This may be accidental or actually intended by the female character, or even a result of a device by the other character. This action is generally seen as sexually charged by the viewers and often also by the cast, so it will usually happen in an ecchi context; as such, something such as a mother hugging her child won`t generally count.</description>

The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations.

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

<name>working life</name>
<description>The life of someone actually working on a often less than glamorous job is depicted in this anime. The job is taxing and the pay is low, not really the dream job one would choose to work in.
Examples: Working as salesperson in a department store, or as a waitress in a family restaurant.</description>

<description>A little bit of the story is found after the credit titles. A little bonus for those patient enough!
This applies regardless of if the credits play over an ED sequence, or over the "regular episode" that continues to air into the credits.
A sequence at the end of an episode, showing what will happen in the next episode, is NOT a post-credits scene; that is a preview.</description>

<name>Takanashi Souta</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Takanashi Souta is a high school student who was pressed into service at Wagnaria by Taneshima Poplar. Poplar keeps mispronouncing his name as `Katanashi`, and can never seem to say it properly. He is a self-described `minicon`, a person with an obsession with small, cute things such as children, kittens, hamsters, and water fleas, and as such is immediately charmed by the diminutive Taneshima.
Since he is the only boy in a family of five, he wound up wearing many of his sisters` old clothes as a child, and as such harbors deep insecurities about his masculinity. He arguably allows Inami Mahiru to keep hitting him as this works as affirmation for his manhood.</description>

<description>Taneshima Popura is a waitress at Wagnaria, and the first employee of the odd restaurant that Takanashi meets. While she is a year older than Takanashi (who calls her `senpai`, as she is his upperclassman at the same school), she is very small for her age, and is too weak to perform some of the menial tasks at the restaurant. She does not take kindly to remarks about her small size, even when they are meant to be complimentary.</description>

<description>Inami Mahiru is a waitress at Wagnaria, who harbors a deep fear of men, and will involuntary hit any man who comes too close to her. She is also freakishly strong despite her willowy appearance. Since Takanashi Souta started working at Wagnaria, she has been hitting him more frequently than others, a risk he takes so he can cure her androphobia.
[SPOILER]It turns out that Inami`s father is to blame for her behavior, since he brainwashed her into fearing all men and placed extra weights in her schoolbags which gradually increased her strength.[/SPOILER]</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Todoroki Yachiyo is a waitress at Wagnaria. She has a strange obsession with Kyouko that began when they were children, and will do anything she asks, which usually means making her a parfait or some other food. She will not tolerate anyone who even seems to make advances that may take Kyouko away from her, and will readily threaten someone inopportune enough to do so with her katana, which she carries at all times.
Satou Jun seems to like her, and she seems to like him best among all of her male co-workers, but her obsession with Kyouko makes any progress between them unlikely.</description>

She is a childhood friend of Todoroki, whom she once saved from bullying, but that seems to have mutated into a strange obsession, but Kyouko seems as oblivious to this as with almost everything else, content to receive Todoroki`s service as it is given.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>"Kotori-chan" is Takanashi Souta in drag. The name `Kotori` derives from a more straightforward reading of `小鳥`, using the ordinary kun-yomi readings of the kanji rather than the variant nanori reading that becomes `Takanashi`. Despite his distaste for cross-dressing, Takanashi is convinced to do so when Inami`s father visits Wagnaria, and again during his date with her.
Taneshima idolizes Kotori-chan as being the woman she aspires to be.</description>
