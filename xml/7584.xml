<description>In the context of manga and associated media, shounen, literally meaning "youth" and often also specifically "boy", refers to a male audience roughly between the ages of 10 and 18.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>Kasuga Kyousuke</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kasuga Kyousuke is the male protagonist in the love triangle. He and his siblings have supernatural powers and are described as espers in the series. They are forbidden from using their powers in public, lest they be discovered and exploited. Kyousuke`s esper powers include teleportation, telekinesis, and "time-slipping" (a kind of time travel) while falling from heights such as stairs. He can alter mechanical devices such as elevators and traffic lights. He can direct his powers to his ears to amplify his hearing and he has also demonstrated a hypnotism power as evidenced when he hypnotized himself to be more decisive. Kyousuke is also rarely shown to use his powers to temporarily amplify his speed and strength. On very rare occasions—generally, when http://anidb.net/ch7408 [Madoka] is directly threatened—his power has taken the form of raw energy that can shatter concrete walls or short out every light in a disco. Kyousuke is a pretty gentle person and a bit of a goody-goody—when he sees Madoka smoking, he scolds her in a very nerdy way (and then uses his powers to destroy her cigarette). It is his indecisiveness that leads to the love triangle with http://anidb.net/ch7428 [Hikaru] and Madoka. He is unable to decide between his feelings for Hikaru and Madoka. Due to the loose manner that he and his sisters relate to each other it`s a running gag that many characters consider him a playboy and two-timing since it is believed he is dating Hikaru.

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The archetypical "kimagure" (whimsical) character, Madoka is secretly in love with Kyousuke, and is best friends with Hikaru Hiyama (who is also in love with Kyousuke). Madoka is described as having an adult allure despite being in junior high school.
When she first meets Kyousuke, she appears to be a pretty and sweet girl. This, however, is in stark contrast to her personality at school, where she is aloof and feared by both the male and female students as a reputed juvenile delinquent. In the TV series she is nicknamed "Madoka the Pick" due to her ability to wield a guitar pick like a shuriken. Despite her "punk" reputation, Madoka is also shown to excel at various activities both scholarly and athletic. She is able to earn high marks in school and still work a part time at Cafe ABCB (pronounced "ah-ba kah-ba").
Madoka`s parents are kind-hearted but workaholic professional musicians often touring outside Japan, so she lives in a large house with her older sister. After her sister gets married and goes to live abroad with her husband, Madoka lives there alone. The story involves the eventual shedding of her tough exterior after she becomes Kyousuke`s friend, as evidenced by the changes in her life after she meets him. She gives up smoking because of him, and in the manga other characters note that she becomes friendlier and does better academically following Kyousuke`s arrival.</description>

<name>Hiyama Hikaru</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Hiyama Hikaru is initially presented as being unpleasant, a brawler, and a tougher talker than http://anidb.net/ch7408 [Madoka]. But once she becomes friends with http://anidb.net/ch7407 [Kyousuke], it is revealed that she is actually kind, sweet and energetic, as well as very loyal to those she cares for. Hikaru is also somewhat child-like, specially since she is an only daughter and somewhat sheltered; when she gets extremely excited, she sometimes tends to revert to a form of baby talk, which is seen as cute by Japanese standards. She refers to Kyousuke by the English word "Darling" (even before she knew his name).
Hikaru is two years younger than Madoka and Kyousuke, and has the same birthday as Kyousuke (15.11); she also is in the same classroom as http://anidb.net/ch7895 [Hino Yuusaku] and the Kasuga sisters. She has feelings for Kyousuke, who cares for her but more as a sister than a prospect girlfriend, and has been Madoka`s best and almost only friend for several years since she and Yuusaku were the only ones who were never afraid of her. Hikaru befriended Madoka when a bully took away little Hikaru`s favorite medallion, and a pre-teen Madoka witnessed this and stalked the bully until he returned it to Hikaru, sealing the girls` friendship.
