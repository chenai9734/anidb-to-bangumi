<description>Professor Saotome discovered an extremely powerful energy emanating from the Sun, the Getter Rays. This new source of energy had the power to revolutionize the Earth and give us an unlimited source of power. To further study these rays, Prof. Saotome created three ships that could travel to space and gather information for him; Getter Eagle, Getter Jaguar, and Getter Bear. These ships, powered by the Getter Rays, could combine into a super powerful robot, Getter Robo.
Getter Robo was created for peace, but one day the Megazaur kingdom appeared and proclaimed itself the original rulers of the Earth. The Megazaur were a kingdom of dinosaurs that originally inhabited the Earth sixty five million years ago. A meteor had struck the planet and bombarded all living things in Getter Rays. Daimajin Yura, their "God," led the survivors underground to protect them from these harmful rays. Now led by King Gora, the Megazaur claimed that since they had been the original inhabitants of the Earth, they were the true rulers of the planet. They had been lying dormant underground, waiting for a perfect time to strike. The sudden surge in Getter Rays had awakened them. Prof. Saotome realized the true potential of Getter Robo. Prof. Saotome sent out a prototype Getter Robo with three test pilots, including his son Tatsuhito. However that Getter Robo was destroyed, and the Professor`s son was killed. He then entrusted the Getter machines to three new pilots, Ryoma Nagare, Hayato Jin, and Musashi Tomoe. Together, the three fought the invading swarm of Megazaur KiKaiju. By changing the configuration of the Getter Machines, Getter Robo could actually transform into three separate Robots. Getter-1, piloted by Ryoma, was an all purpose robot, and the team`s main form. Getter-1 has an average combination of speed and strength to better suit him to most situations. Getter-2, piloted by Hayato, was a sleek robot designed for speed as opposed to strength and firepower. Its drill hand allows it to destroy enemies and tunnel into the earth. Musashi piloted Getter-3, a huge tank that carried more strength and firepower than any other Getter, but at the cost of speed and agility. Prof. Saotome`s daughter, Michiru, also helps in battle by piloting a small support vessel called the Command Machine.
Note: Episode 6 was also screened at Toei Manga Matsuri on 25.07.1974.</description>

<name>dinosaur</name>
<description>Dinosaurs are vertebrate animals that dominated terrestrial ecosystems for over 160 million years, first appearing approximately 230 million years ago. At the end of the Cretaceous Period, 66 million years ago, non-avian dinosaurs suffered a catastrophic extinction, which ended their dominance on land. Taxonomists consider modern birds to be the direct descendants of theropod dinosaurs.
Since the first dinosaur was recognized in the 19th century, mounted, fossilized dinosaur skeletons have become major attractions at museums around the world. Dinosaurs have become a part of world culture and remain consistently popular, especially among children. They have been featured in best-selling books and films such as Jurassic Park, and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media.

<description>Football is a sport that involves kicking a ball in order to score a goal, while the other team tries to stop you by kicking the ball in the other direction to score a goal of their own. In the United States, this sport is known as soccer; the inappropriately titled "American" football (which in fact is played with the egg-shaped "ball" being carried around) is some kind of rugby for babies.</description>

<name>judo</name>
<description>Judo, or juudou in Japanese, is a modern martial art, combat and Olympic sport created in Japan in 1882. Its most prominent feature is its competitive element, where the objective is to either throw or takedown an opponent to the ground, immobilize or otherwise subdue an opponent with a pin, or force an opponent to submit with a joint lock or a choke. Strikes and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defenses are a part of judo, but only in pre-arranged forms, and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice. A judo practitioner is called a judoka. The philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial arts that developed from traditional schools. The worldwide spread of judo has led to the development of a number of offshoots.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>Somewhere down the line, it became the "norm" that boys don`t cry. The scenario does not matter; shedding tears is the ultimate no-no in terms of what you can and cannot do as a man (at least in the West, anyway). But there comes a time when a man`s emotions do get the better of him, and they pour forth - as prerequisite an impassioned speech may or may not be present - by cascading down his cheeks. These are what we like to call "manly tears". Extremely powerful. Not limited but often used in hot-blooded / super robot shows. Examples include Yuusha Ou GaoGaiGar, Getter Robo and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.
The opposite of manly tears are "girly tears".</description>

The main feature of the franchise is having a story that crosses over several popular mecha anime, manga and video games, allowing characters and mecha from different titles to team up or battle one another. Due to the nature of crossover games and licensing involved, only a few games have been released outside Japan, and in English; early English-language games only feature Banpresto`s original characters and mecha, and a flagship installment were to never be released until 2016, with the English release of Super Robot Wars V in Southeast Asian countries.

<name>Tomoe Musashi</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Tomoe Musashi is a fictional character from the mecha series Getter Robo. He is most famous for his sacrificial final battle that helped end the fight with the Dinosaur Empire. He has however, appeared in subsequent manga and stories due to his popularity and nostalgic quality.
He is an extremely hot-blooded young man and the pilot of the third Getter robot and the Getter machine "Bear". Musashi is short and quite fat, but also very physically strong. He leads his prefecture`s Judo team and has yet to be defeated in a match. Although he doesn`t seem like a likely candidate to pilot a Getter machine, Professor Saotome (the creator of the Getter) saw potential in Musashi and requested he pilot the third Getter. Reluctantly, he agrees and although he at first butts heads with his fellow pilots Nagare Ryouma and Jin Hayato (most especially the latter) he forms a very strong friendship with the two and often settles disputes (albeit often violently).
Despite his rather tough sounding personality and behavior however, Musashi is at his core a goofball. He often stumbles when on foot (a common seen trademark of overweight characters in anime at the time), has the most hilarious reactions to things he doesn`t understand, and often gives the series its lighter moments with his hijinks, such as sending his mother a picture of Saotome`s daughter Michiru and himself telling her they`re dating despite this being a fib. Musashi is in fact, quite infatuated with Michiru as is constantly hinted throughout the series. He seems to constantly struggle to ask her out but is often stopped by his awkwardness and shyness around women. Whether these feelings are returned or not is never depicted, although there are subtle hints that perhaps it may have. This is even teased in a recent OVA where it is implied that Musashi and Michiru were a couple. Musashi`s very combat uniform is quite humorous. As opposed to a space suit like the other two pilots, Musashi wears old Samurai or possible judo body armor that fits snugly over his bulky frame, and a construction helmet with goggles on it and a rather amateurish yellow cape (that is once again too small for him) worn over his "costume".
Sadly however, this is in most cases never meant to be. Throughout the series, despite his contributions and his likable personality, Musashi constantly feels like the odd one out in comparison to the skilled and determined Ryoma, and cool as ice Hayato. This deeply hidden insecurity comes to haunt Musashi in the final episodes of the first series when the Getter Robo proves ineffective. In a last desperate attempt to destroy the Dinosaur empire`s most hideous creation, the three Getter Machines plan to drop specially designed super bombs in unision to destroy the monster. However because of circumstances beyond his control Musashi botches up the mission and the plan fails...resulting in the Getter being damaged severely beyond repair. Despite initial anger, his comrades take it rather well but Musashi however is devastated. The Professor puts into motion one last, desperate plan using his daughter`s fighter and a modified version of the previous bomb for one last desperate attempt to destroy the beast. The mission however, is extremely dangerous and borderlines on suicide. Michiru accepts her duty, however before she can take off she finds that Musashi has stolen the fighter and despite her desperate pleas...executes the mission on his own to make up for his past failure. Because he had to dodge many attacks, the bomb fails to hit its target once again and in one last desperate action...Musashi suicide bombs the fighter to the inside of the monster`s mouth destroying both in the process.
Musashi`s death is devastating to the Getter crew and although newcomer replacement Kurama Benkei fills his position with flying colors, Musashi is often referenced to in the sequel series.
Although Musashi`s character is fondly remembered, what is perhaps Musashi`s most memorable trait is the fact he dies a very large number of different ways. Similar to the case of Tochiro Oyama of Captain Harlock (and Leiji Matsumoto`s universe in general) and later Kenny McCormick of South Park, Musashi has a tendency to have many different deaths depicted, throwing into question the actual canon death. Although his original death was tragic and is arguably considered the canon death, many viewers note that it almost feels like a running joke with how many times Musashi dies yet miraculously shows up in subsequent appearances. Some of his many deaths include:
* His original death by using a kamikaze tactic to kill the final creature in the series.
* In the short film Getter Robo G vs. Great Mazinger (although they never actually fight, but are rather allies), Musashi dies a bit more of a pitiful death at the beginning when a desperate alien catches Musashi`s machine off guard and kamikazes into it.
* In Change! Shin Getter Robo: the last day, Musashi is depicted as a much more serious character. He fights against the coming apocalypse to his best ability, but he is eventually crushed by the Invaders in his incapacitated Getter-3. The wrecked Getter-3 is later found 13 years later by Benkei and the OVA`s main characters, however Musashi`s body is never shown.
* In Neo Getter Robo vs. Shin Getter Robo, Musashi uses the all three of the Getter`s forms to fight off the Dinosaur Empire in New York City to stall until Shin Getter is activated. However, he is overwhelmed and as a last resort, he crushes the Getter`s core causing an explosion that wipes out almost all of the Dinosaurs - as well as all of Manhattan Island. This is pretty much the same end he faces in the original manga, though there the battle happens not too far from the Saotome Institute, to gain time for Getter Robo G being completed. Here, it is to allow the completion of Shin Getter Robo.
* In Shin Getter Robo (2004) (Also known as New Getter Robo), Musashi is not mentioned in name, however, someone who closely resembles Musashi gets brutally killed by Hayato Jin about 5 minutes into the second episode. In Musashi`s place there is a character by the name of Benkei Musashibou who is a mix of both Getter-3 pilots.
* In the Super Robot Wars various spinoffs, Musashi dies in many different ways but often miraculously appears in the next installment. This is mostly because most of Super Robot Wars installments take place in an alternate universe to each other, with the exception of continuing timelines such as the Classic Timeline or the Alpha series (where he died for real in Super Robot Wars Alpha 2 and only appears as a spirit in the next installment). One of the possible outcomes in Super Robot Wars Advance enables Musashi to actually survive until the end of its continuity, since it`s a standalone game unlike the Alpha series. It is still possible to let Musashi die in that game, though.
* In real Life, Musashi`s Voice Actor Toku Nishio died on July 16, 2005.
Musashi`s very role in the original series has become something of a long-going anime archetype as well. The trend that every team of super robot pilots (or super heroes in general) must always have "the fat guy" was arguably jump started by Musashi. Even in subsequent Getter installments, the team must always have a large character pilot the third machine as a tradition (except for special occurrences). Musashi`s immediate replacement Benkei is himself a large stature man, and Gai in both Shin Getter Robo vs Neo Getter Robo and Getter Robo Armageddon and other subsequent appearances is enormous in both size and girth, particularly in Neo Getter Robo vs. Shin Getter Robo. This "role" in team formations has been spoofed many times in anime, and it has appeared far less frequently in the recent decade, mostly due to fat characters becoming far more rarely seen in anime in general in recent years.</description>

<description>Nagare Ryouma is a fictional character created by Go Nagai and Ken Ishikawa. He is the protagonist and main pilot in the Getter Robo franchise. He is a hot-blooded youth in high school. He pilots the Getter-1, Getter Dragon, and Shin Getter-1 in the manga and anime.
Ryouma goes to high school with Musashi, Hayato, and Michiru. He travels to the Satome Research Institute on the day the Prototype Getter Robo is being tested. He witnesses the death of the Prototype Getter Robo team including the son of Professor Tomoe at the hands of the Evil Dinosaur Empire. He enlists the aid of Musashi Tomoe and Hayato Jin in order to pilot the real Getter Robo. Ryoma piloting the Getter-1 is key to battling the Dinosaur Empire. Ryouma and his friends fight the Dinosaur Empire until the final battle in which Musahi gives his life to defeat them.
Even after the defeat of the Dinosaur Empire, a new threat arises in the form of the Clan of the 100 Demons. The remaining members of the Getter Robo team get Benkei Kurama to pilot the last jet of the Getter Robo G. Ryouma pilots the Getter Dragon in the second series.
In the 1998 OVA series Getter Robo Armageddon, Ryouma was framed for the murder of Dr. Saotome. After a resurrected Dr. Saotome threatens to destroy the world, he is released from jail to commit the very murder he was accused of. Ryouma holds a grudge with Hayato; who not only committed the murder of Saotome, he also testified against him. After failing to stop a nuclear attack on Shin Dragon, he vanishes from Earth. He reappears 13 years later in an abandoned base located on the Moon. He rejoins the fight against The Invaders piloting a customized Getter, the Black Getter.
Ryouma appears as a supporting characters in Shin Getter Robo vs Neo Getter Robo. Mentally scarred after being tortured by the Dinosaur Empire and the death of Musashi, he quits the Getter Team and wanders Japan as a martial artist. He returns and helps the New Getter Team when the Dinosaurs Empire attempts to destroy Shin Getter Robo.</description>

When combined with the others he pilots Getter 2. The machine reflects Hayato`s physical strength and speed.</description>
