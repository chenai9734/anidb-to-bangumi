<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="269894">This anime is like the epitome of "ehh...okay". Action scenes are pretty flat. There is little development from episodes 1 to 50. And then there`s an amazing arc. And then it falls flat a little bit again. Humor is there but is often poorly placed. But the characters are pretty darn awesome, and it makes you want to stick around. Allen Walker is one of my favorite MCs. The underlying story also hooks you in. The setting and world that the mangaka created is great.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="492032">Actualy I enjoyed this anime but in the middle it`s getting kind of boring. And it`s kind of childish it`s not horror or thriller.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="375852">great shounen series</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="269414">an entertaining anime, it`s just a shame that it ends so fast, I want more =)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="243082">Very enjoyable watch, absolutely loved the series. It started to drift off a little but around the 65+ mark the series changed and the main character matures substantially with episode 70 being one of my favourites anime episodes of all time.

Unfortunately it is yet another unfinished story, it builds, the characters and plot mature but it ends abruptly and after this amount of time it`s unlikely it will ever get finished.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="489452">Normal/Average anime, i like it watching and what`s happening there, of course like other anime`s here are few things that i don`t like how they look, could be better or could be different, but all together i put mark 8, why 8 in permanent ? because i needed some romance a bit, the main guy which name is Allen Walker who has this white hair and the girl Lenalee Lee whit dark green hair seems to like each other, at some moments i think that there is sparkle between them, but then everything stops and no one is stepping forward to each other.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="193384">This anime is ok. It`s only bad when being compared with the original manga. If you`ve already loved the manga, it probably won`t appeal to you that much. But if you haven`t read D.Gray man yet, I recommend you watch this. Just do it before reading the manga though.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="608137">It was good, but then get off track toward the middle, then the ending is incomplete. Overall it was good to watch then finish it by reading the manga.</recommendation>

Great anime and great characters but a bit boring in the beginning due to allen the main character not having many fight moves however witnessing the story evolving is definetly worth the wait . itfollows the manga to the last breath unfortunately it was suffocated by the producers. the manga is still ongoing so be sure to watch the anime and continue from where it ends with the manga</recommendation>

<description>A bounty hunter is one who hunts and captures targets (be it people, animals, etc.) for monetary gain, preferably without killing/destroying their target. Despite being illegal in most of the world today, it is a legal profession in the United States and Philippines (a former commonwealth of the US), who are known as "bail enforcement agents".

<name>moe</name>
<description>Moe is a Japanese slang loanword that refers to feelings of strong affection mainly towards characters in anime, manga, and video games. Moe, however, has also gained usage to refer to feelings of affection towards any subject. Moe can be related to lust; however, pure lust without other feelings is considered outside its scope. The word Moe originated in the late 1980s and early 1990s in Japan and is of uncertain origin, although there are several theories on how it came into use.
At the anime level, the http://anidb.net/t7146 [cute girls doing cute things (CGDCT)] tag may also apply.

<name>vampire</name>
<description>A vampire is a mythological or folkloric nocturnal undead. Vampires use long fangs to penetrate the necks of people, usually young females, to drink their blood, both as a form of nourishment and to turn the targets into slaves.
In the classic vampire stories, they are thought to have no reflection in mirrors, are able to shapeshift into bats (sometimes also wolves or some form of fog), have unlimited lifespan and superhuman strength, reflexes and senses, and may only be killed by silver bullets, silver blades, a stake through the heart, fire, or exposure to sunlight; on the other hand, they cannot tolerate garlic, holy water, or Christian crosses (sometimes expanded to religious symbols in general).
In modern anime, these limitations are usually dropped, and they become far more powerful and fearsome opponents than usual. A human bitten, or sometimes even scratched, by a vampire typically becomes a slave, eventually dying as if poisoned, and becoming a vampire, ghoul, zombie, or other form of undead after death, often staying under the command of the vampire who originally bit them.</description>

<description>A Femme fatale (french for "deadly woman") often leads men into compromising, dangerous, and deadly situations. She tries to achieve her hidden purpose by using feminine wiles such as beauty, charm, and sexual allure. Typically, she is exceptionally well-endowed with these qualities. In some situations, she uses lying or coercion rather than charm. She may also be (or imply to be) a victim, caught in a situation from which she cannot escape.</description>

<name>tsundere</name>
<description>Tsundere (ツンデレ) (pronounced /(t)sʌnˈdɪə(r)/ in English or /t͡sun.de.ɽe/ in Japanese) is a Japanese concept of a character archetype which describes a person with a conceited, irritable, and/or violent personality that suddenly becomes modest and loving when triggered by some sort of cause (such as being alone with someone). The inverse scenario, where a modest and loving person becomes conceited/irritable/violent, is also a tsundere.
The default state does not matter. The character can default to "tsuntsun" or "deredere"; the key concept is the fact that there`s a (generally very quick) flip from one mode to the other.
It can also describe a contradictory personality which is good-willed on the inside, but with a harsh attitude on the outside. Originally found in Japanese bishoujo games, the word is now part of the otaku moe phenomenon, reaching into other media such as anime, manga, novels, and even mass media.
Tsundere is a portmanteau of the two words tsuntsun (ツンツン), and deredere (デレデレ). Tsuntsun is defined as "aloof, morose, pointed", and deredere is defined as "exhausted, lovestruck". Tsunderekko (ツンデレっ娘) is a related noun, referring to a girl with a tsundere personality. Like nekomimi, tsundere is considered a moe-inspiring character trait. The concept has received increasing attention in Japan, with a tsundere cafe opened in Akihabara and tsundere-themed products released (like Tomy Co.`s portable television set), and the concept increasingly reflected in recent anime, from an extended discussion of the meaning of the concept and its origin on the internet in http://anidb.net/a4777 [Lucky Star]`s Lucky Channel segment to merchandise for http://anidb.net/a3651 [The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya] classifying the characters according to tsundere-ness. Another accepted definition of tsundere is a girl who has a combative attitude toward others but is also kind on the inside. She usually plays out as having an attitude toward the main character, usually a male, and often criticizing him in one way or another, but as the series progresses she eventually warms up to him and sometimes even falls in love with him.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>An anime that takes place in an alternative past is an anime that clearly does not belong to the future or the present, and isn`t tied particularly closely to our history, or has ties to our history but only as a premise: there are too many things that don`t make sense for the time-period. In some cases there is futuristic technology present, but the overall setting still feels that of the past. However the setting must still take place on Earth, since we can not know if the history of a fantasy world is an alternate one or not.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>magic circles</name>
<description>A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised.
Traditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for non-magical work such as meditation.
Generally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names.

<name>parallel world</name>
<description>A parallel world, parallel universe, or alternative reality is a self-contained separate reality coexisting with our own. Because "alternative reality" sometimes implies that the reality is a variant of our own, like for example a mirror world, we use the term "parallel world/universe" which is more general, without any connotations implying a relationship (or lack thereof) with our own world/universe (meaning a fictional world can just as well have an alternative reality, it doesn`t need to be our reality). To put it more simply, this category is to show if more than 1 world/universe/reality is present in the anime.
Multiple timelines of the same world/universe/reality are NOT considered parallel worlds. For example, in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate] the cast travels through multiple "World Lines", which are defined as parallel timelines of the same universe had various events occurred with differing outcomes.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<name>steampunk</name>
<description>Steampunk is a sub-genre of science fiction that typically features steam-powered machinery, especially in a setting inspired by industrialized Western civilization during the 19th century. Steampunk works are often set in an alternative history of the 19th century`s British Victorian era or American "Wild West", in a post-apocalyptic future during which steam power has regained mainstream use, or in a fantasy world that similarly employs steam power.
Noteworthy attributes of the theme include large amounts smoke pollution from wood or coal burning, the affinity to metal constructs like cogs and metal tubing, and the mechanization of everyday objects.
Steampunk perhaps most recognisably features anachronistic technologies or retro-futuristic inventions as people in the 19th century might have envisioned them, and is likewise rooted in the era`s perspective on fashion, culture, architectural style, and art.
Such technology may include fictional machines like those found in the works of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, or the modern authors Philip Pullman, Scott Westerfeld, Stephen Hunt and China Miéville. Other examples of steampunk contain alternative history-style presentations of such technology as lighter-than-air airships, analog computers, or such digital mechanical computers as Charles Babbage`s Analytical Engine.
Steampunk can also exemplify everything that is bad about unrestrained technological progress (dead matter), when compared to life and nature. The anime usually makes a point to propound the latter.

Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>important haircut</name>
<description>When a character cuts off his or her hair, it often symbolizes a rite of passage or bout of character growth. A princess striking out on an adventure, or a new recruit at boot camp, for instance. Hair is something that takes time and effort to grow, so parting with it voluntarily can be a powerful act.
This is particularly a big deal when women get haircuts. Yet in fiction, even an accidental hair slicing can leave a character with a surprisingly even cut.
In many religions (Western Christianity, Ancient Egyptian religion, and others) priests and/or monks cut/shave their hair. Roman Catholic nuns also tend to cut and mantain their hair short under their veils when they enter the nunneries. The cutting of one`s own hair is also a part of Buddhist mythology, specifically something done by Siddhartha himself early on in his path to enlightenment, so anime examples might draw from this as an allusion. There are also some cultures, including Native American and many Asians, where a person would cut his or her hair as an act of grief, disgrace, or even rebellion. In the Confucian tradition, hair (like the rest of your body) is considered a gift from your parents and may not be damaged without a very good reason. Furthermore, prisoners and psychiatric patients commonly have their heads shaved, often to prevent the spread of lice, but sometimes also as a demeaning measure.

<description>Hanami (花見, lit. "flower viewing") is the Japanese traditional custom of enjoying the beauty of flowers, "flower" in this case almost always meaning cherry blossoms or ume blossoms. 
From the end of March to early May, sakura bloom all over Japan, and around the first of February on the island of Okinawa. The blossom forecast (桜前線 sakurazensen, literally cherry blossom front) is announced each year by the weather bureau, and is watched carefully by those planning hanami as the blossoms only last a week or two. 
In modern-day Japan, hanami mostly consists of having an outdoor party beneath the sakura during daytime or at night. Hanami at night is called yozakura (夜桜, literally night sakura).

<description>Important characters will have a terrible tendency to die dramatically, but will not, under any circumstances, stay dead. This tends to cheapen the dramatic death of a character to the point of being little more than a flesh wound if overused. If you ever hear passing mention of any form of afterlife in a series, be warned that the value of "dead" has become a whole lot less all of a sudden. Similarly, if the entire supporting cast is being killed off left and right, expect a resurrection by the end of the current arc. This trope became so common in some series that most people are more likely to be shocked if a character does not come back from the dead than when it does.</description>

<description>Cannibalism is the practice of an individual of a species eating parts or the whole of another individual of the same species; as such, human cannibalism is when a human eats the flesh, organs, or other parts of another human being.</description>

<name>talking is a free action</name>
<description>Time in comics is flexible. Each panel shows a single event, which is usually accompanied by a length of dialog, which must take some time to say. This disparity is usually accepted if it isn`t taken to extremes.
But often, characters will exposit when it`s most needed: at the story`s climax, when both the intricacies of the plot and the intensity of action hit their highest.
While the Heroes Outrun the Fireball, Mr. Exposition might explain why the Evil Overlord`s death caused the explosion. The Action Girl can deliver impressive lectures on why the monster`s Achilles` Heel will work, while still engaging in Waif-Fu. The Superhero can quip to his heart`s content and explain his abilities while dueling one insignificant mobster, or deliver a Kirk Summation during the course of a single Finishing Move. Sometimes even apparent mere mortals can give a lecture on what is happening when it would be a much better idea to simply run like hell.
Without stopping to breathe, apparently.

<name>star-crossed lovers</name>
<description>Two lovers — usually teenagers — destined to be kept apart no matter how hard they struggle to be together. It may be fate or just feuding families, or even something as mundane as a few hundred miles, but something will always be in their way. Often, the two can only be together in death. The phrase is astrological in origin, stemming from the belief that the positions of the stars ruled over people`s fates. To describe a relationship as "star-crossed" is to say that it is "thwarted by a malign star", or that the stars are working against the relationship. Shakespeare`s Romeo and Juliet is the most famous example of this archetype but it dates back at least as far as the ancient Greeks.
"From forth the fatal loins of these two foes, / a pair of star-cross`d lovers, take their life."
- Romeo and Juliet, prologue</description>

<name>dark atmosphere</name>
<description>Usually metaphorical. Sometimes literal. At times both!
Typically this refers to the fact that the story is set in a grim, dog eat dog milieu — for example a decaying city.
Often the characters are just doing what they need to do to survive, with little or no expectation that their lives can be better. And often characters may feel they do not have any real choice in what they do.
And yes, occasionally the setting is actually dark — be it night or perpetually heavy cloudy sky and rain. It all adds to the oppressive, hopeless feeling of the show.
You probably will not feel uplifted or happy after watching this anime.</description>

<name>gore</name>
<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

<description>Be careful what you wish for... your wish may actually come true. This is an age-old philosophical problem of what human beings think they want and what is actually good for them. The power to wish for anything can be very dangerous and usually — as a moral lesson — yields unexpected / unwanted results.
A contract with the devil is a specific case of this; receiving great power, especially from a devil, is usually a double edged sword.</description>

<description>A "curse" in this manner depicts an adversity placed upon a person or object by a supernatural power often represented by unique designs and symbols found on the inflicted. While not all curses have negative effects, the majority are meant to remain forever hexing to the receiving victim`s soul.
A common portrayal is that which is conjured by an individual that has been caused great suffering and thereby extracts revenge against the accuser in the form of a curse. This abuser will then have their soul spirited away to hell to suffer endlessly for the rest of eternity. In some instances (such as in `Jigoku Shoujo`) the character who extracts revenge also condemns their own soul to Hell upon death.</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<description>Lenalee Lee is a 16-year-old Exorcist from Hong Kong and member of the http://anidb.net/ch32499 [European Branch] of the http://anidb.net/ch32498 [Black Order]. Her parents were killed by an Akuma when she was very young, and she was forced to become an Exorcist as a child.
Because she was separated from her brother http://anidb.net/ch7365 [Komui], her only remaining family member, she repeatedly tried to escape and was restrained. This caused her to hate the Order and Innocence. When Komui joined the Order to be with her, she stopped trying to escape. She now fights for her brother as well as her friends, as she now knows she has a home and family to return to. Her perception of the "world" consists of her friends and family; whenever one of her friends dies, it seems to her as if a part of her world has been destroyed.
The Dark Boots, her Equipment-type anti-Akuma weapon, take the form of a pair of black, knee-high boots that give her the ability to run at high speeds, jump to great heights, walk on water, create whirlwinds and use sound waves as footholds.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Allen Walker is a soft-spoken and warm-hearted 15-year-old Exorcist of British origin and the main protagonist of the series. Allen was abandoned by his biological parents because of the paralysis and supposed "deformity" of his left arm and at age seven was adopted by http://anidb.net/ch32514 [Mana Walker]. Three years later, Mana died and Allen turned him into an Akuma, hoping him to be fully resurrected. Instead, he cursed Allen and sliced through his left eye, giving him the ability to detect disguised Akuma. It was at this same moment that Allen`s left arm first awoke as an anti-Akuma weapon and instinctively destroyed the Akuma. He was later found by http://anidb.net/ch9409 [Cross Marian] and trained as his disciple until he was sent to the http://anidb.net/ch32498 [Black Order]`s http://anidb.net/ch32499 [Headquarters] five years later to officially become an Exorcist.
His Parasitic-type anti-Akuma weapon goes through two different forms resembling giant arms until it reaches its true form, the Crown Clown, which takes the form of a type of fur cape and a giant claw. Later on, it is able to additionally produce a large sword from Allen`s left arm, resembling the sword the http://anidb.net/ch9471 [Earl] uses. Shortly after his anti-Akuma weapon takes the form of the Crown Clown, his synchronization rate exceeded the percentage required for General level. When the Crown Clown was created, Allen claimed his right hand was for the human race and his left for the Akuma.
Recently, allegations have arisen against Allen by http://anidb.net/ch32795 [Malcolm C.

These accusations are further exacerbated when Allen, upon impaling himself with the Crown Clown, experiences severe pain, and starts to awaken the 14th Noah`s memories; he later bears a scar from this injury.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Lavi is a cheerful 18-year-old red-haired Exorcist of mixed heritage. He aims to become a Bookman, a person who records the hidden history of the world, and has been trained from a young age to achieve that goal. He travels extensively with the http://anidb.net/ch7367 [Bookman Senior], archiving various instances of history from a supposedly non-interferative standpoint. He is later shown to possess heightened combat and intuitive skills, and extremely photographic memorization abilities.
Lavi is the 49th alias he assumed after casting away his real name to reach that goal. He works alongside the http://anidb.net/ch32498 [Black Order] just to be close to the events that must be seen, but slowly becomes more attached to his friends in Black Order, and his original Bookman self is constantly being clouded by his growing care for them.
His Equipment-type anti-Akuma weapon, Iron Hammer, often referred to as "Big Hammer, Little Hammer", is capable of growing and extending to undefined sizes and lengths. The weapon allows him to use "Seals" that control several elements of nature.

He is a Second Exorcist, an Exorcist raised in a test tube and artificially modified to bear the Innocence of the previous Exorcist his brain formerly belonged to.

Mugen, his Equipment-type anti-Akuma weapon, is a sword with supernatural powers. The shape of the sword has changed throughout the story: during his childhood, it takes the form of a small butcher blade with multiple small wings on the hilt; upon Kanda`s introduction in the beginning of the series, it took the form of a chokuto with a black cross-emblazoned hilt and sheath; after his battle with http://anidb.net/ch9411 [Skin Boric], it was reforged into a traditional http://anidb.net/t1640 [katana].

<description>The Millenium Earl is the First Disciple of the http://anidb.net/ch10022 [Noah Family], and is truly named Adam. He is the story`s main antagonist.
The Earl resembles a grotesque caricature of a Victorian gentleman: a rotund figure in cape and top hat, with a perpetual enormous grin, a pair of pince-nez spectacles, and horns hidden under the hat. Despite his intentions he often displays a cheerful attitude, but is quick to reveal his more intimidating and malicious side. He is often seeing holding a small living being known as http://anidb.net/ch32940 [Lero] as a regular umbrella, but is also seen using it to summon Akuma.
He has a sword, nearly identical to http://anidb.net/ch7347 [Allen Walker]`s sword of exorcism which amazes him when the two briefly clash in Noah`s Ark. He distributes playing cards with the details of people he wants killed to his collaborators also containing Cell Roron who is the keeper of the list.
He has existed for 7000 years. He tricks people who mourn for their dead friends or relatives into resurrecting them, turning them into http://anidb.net/t6684 [Akuma], weapons that consume people`s bodies and follow all his orders. The only person known to have escaped this fate is a child name http://anidb.net/ch83367 [Allen Walker], who destroyed the Akuma of his guardian, http://anidb.net/ch32514 [Mana Walker], before it had a chance to take over his body. In the series` beginning, the Earl attempts to kill a young boy whose best friend was killed by his late mother`s Akuma, but is stopped by http://anidb.net/ch7347 [Allen]. Afterwards, the Earl orders his followers, the Noah Family, to kill all of the Generals of the http://anidb.net/ch32498 [Black Order], an organization of exorcists opposing them. This starts another fight against his enemies, the Black Orders` supporting exorcists. Upon learning that one of them, http://anidb.net/ch7123 [Lenalee Lee], might have the Innocence known as the Heart that might give them victory to either side, the Earl traps a group of them into a dimension known as the Noah`s Ark. However, the Ark starts being destroyed, and the Earl escapes the area with Noah http://anidb.net/ch7370 [Tyki Mikk] who was about to be killed by the General http://anidb.net/ch9409 [Cross Marian].
Shortly afterwards, the Earl orders the Noah to send multiple http://anidb.net/ch32723 [Level 3 Akuma] to attack the Black Order`s http://anidb.net/ch32499 [Headquarters] and kill all exorcists. As the exorcists manage to defeat the invaders, the Earl reminisces about why he did not kill Allen in their first meeting and curses himself for it.

<description>The Noah Family consists of thirteen human descendants of Noah who have inherited his genes. A Noah can be identified by a gray skin tone, yellow/gold eyes, and a horizontal line of seven cross-shaped stigmata referred to as holy marks. Like http://anidb.net/t6684 [Akuma] creatures, they base their powers off dark matter, the opposite of Innocence, and as such are vulnerable to Innocence. The Noah share an inborn drive to kill Exorcists, but otherwise possess unique will and mindsets. "Carved" on their genes is a memory of Noah different from any member in their generation and possess a supernatural ability. They claim to be immortal, but this is proven to be an exaggeration after Yu Kanda kills the Noah Skin Bolic.</description>

Daisya was a student of General http://anidb.net/ch32784 [Froi Tiedoll] who found Daisya in his hometown. Daisya was rebellious and rude as a child and fervently denied all interest in being an Exorcist. After his town was attacked by Akuma and he saw how cool General Tiedoll looked, he decided he would like to try and left home. Before he left, he used his soccer ball to kick down the doorbell his family used at their shop, saying it was the only thing in that house he was fond of besides his deadbeat father, nagging mother, two annoying brothers, and his crybaby sister.
Daisya, http://anidb.net/ch7366 [Kanda], and http://anidb.net/ch32930 [Marie] were sent to Barcelona, where General Tiedoll said he would be. Unfortunately for him, Daisya ran into http://anidb.net/ch7370 [Tyki Mikk] who killed him and destroyed his Innocence.
The Charity Bell, his Equipment-type anti-Akuma weapon, hangs at the tip of his hat. When activated, it takes the form of a hollow ball which he can kick around. When the ball goes inside an Akuma`s body, it makes a ringing bell-like sound, which destroys the Akuma.

As Suman did not want to be part of the Black Order in the first place, he was quite lonely during his employment, with the exception of making friends with http://anidb.net/ch32503 [Johnny Gill], whom he played chess with. Usually, Johnny wins, and Suman would refuse to talk with Johnny, and sulk all the time until after a mission, to which Suman would ask for a rematch.
Suman has a Parasite-type anti-Akuma weapon, which takes the form of a gem-like stone near his thumb. He is able to manipulate the wind.

<name>Timcanpy</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Timcanpy is a modified golem that is passed down to http://anidb.net/ch7347 [Allen Walker] from General http://anidb.net/ch9409 [Cross Marian]. It follows Allen (or http://anidb.net/ch7123 [Lenalee] when Allen is not with him) around, and can often be found resting on Allen`s head or shoulders. He has the ability to record the events that occur around him and then play them back, and is able to rebuild himself when he is crushed or destroyed.
It is revealed later that Timcanpy also contains the piano score for the http://anidb.net/ch84636 [14th], and has been owned by http://anidb.net/ch84602 [Nea Walker].
Unlike most other golems, which are mechanical, Timcanpy seems to be a biological being, though what his body is made up of is unclear as he has been seen being reduced to fragments with no discernible organs. He also has a mouth, teeth and tongue. Its size also differs.

His power seems to be a form of telekinesis, as he is seen crushing his target`s limbs without touching them, and manipulating the movements of the Science Department team. He is also seen to manipulate objects, as he did with the pipes that bound http://anidb.net/ch81263 [Alma Karma].

He was the only member, other than http://anidb.net/ch82914 [Road] and the http://anidb.net/ch9471 [Earl], who was able to control the Ark. Before the story`s timeline, he gave this power away to a human and ran, betraying the Earl and the Clan of Noah.
He attempted to kill the Earl in order to become the new Earl himself, but was killed in return by the Earl, an ending which greatly depressed the Earl. Later, it was revealed that the 14th had chosen http://anidb.net/ch7347 [Allen Walker] as his next host. Some time before his death, he told http://anidb.net/ch9409 [Cross Marian] that if http://anidb.net/ch83365 [Mana] was looked after, he would return to him one day.

<description>Built by http://anidb.net/ch7365 [Komui] with the intention of it lightening the workload of the Science Division, Komlin 2 was fully capable of performing surgery and repair work to anti-Akuma weaponry. Komui, though, programmed it to share his intelligence level and personality, resulting in it apparently sharing his love of coffee. It drank Komui`s coffee and went insane, first attempting to make http://anidb.net/ch7365 [Lenalee Lee] more masculine.
When Komui told the robot that http://anidb.net/ch7347 [Allen]`s Innocence was damaged, it made Allen its top priority and trapped it in the surgery room built into its hull. Lenalee then regained consciousness and kicked the robot (as well as her brother when he tried to defend it), making it explode.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Miranda Lotto is a 25-year-old German Exorcist and member of http://anidb.net/ch32499 [European Branch] of the http://anidb.net/ch32498 [Black Order].
She accepted the offer to become an Exorcist after the incident in the rewinding town, but unfortunately, she was separated from her Finder on their way to the Black Order. After all incidents she got herself into, she somehow managed to reach the Headquarters and was last seen praying to http://anidb.net/ch7365 [Komui ]to not have her clock cut apart, as she treasured it dearly.
After http://anidb.net/ch7347 [Allen]`s Innocence was damaged to the point where his status as an Exorcist was suspended, the rest of General http://anidb.net/ch9409 [Cross Marian]`s search party was unable to continue on their way to Edo, since http://anidb.net/ch32776 [Anita]`s ship was severely damaged. At that point, the newly arrived Sammo Han Won announced that Miranda will be joining their group, and that she will be able to help them continue on their way.
The Time Record, her Equipment-type anti-Akuma weapon, is located on her right arm. It allows her to stop or reverse time in an area for a short while, causing any object to revert to its original status. However, any damage the object suffered before and during the reversed time will affect the object once the technique is stopped. She is also unable to resurrect the dead, due to the fact that her Innocence can not erase time.
She used her Time Record to repair Anita`s ship for use, but when she sees the shocked reactions of those around her, she feared she overstepped her boundaries and threw herself into the ocean to atone. Once she had been fished out of the ocean and the group took off on Anita`s ship, Miranda joined the other Exorcists in the captain`s cabin and gave them their new uniforms, sent directly from the European Branch to provide them with better protection.</description>

Due to the castle they lived in and the plants` tendency to attack any guests, rumors began to spread in the nearby village that the inhabitants were Vampires. Shunned by the village and left in isolation, Krory began to feel as if he was just another piece in his grandfather`s collection.

<description>Vittorio is extremely strong warrior from Ancient Rome who was designated to fight for the princess of his kingdom, Sandra. He fought endlessly for her sake in constant fear that if he were to lose a single fight, the princess would have to marry the winner. He was eventually chosen by a fragment of Innocence one thousand years ago due to his prayer of not wanting to lose the princess at a temple, leading to his title "The Millennium Swordsman".
Vittorio refused to fight any woman who tried to fight him. Because of this, http://anidb.net/ch7123 [Lenalee] couldn`t help http://anidb.net/ch7366 [Kanda] and http://anidb.net/ch7347 [Allen]. The Innocence he carried allowed him to remain ageless over hundreds of years and kept him from noticing that the kingdom and princess he had sworn to protect have already disappeared a long time ago.
