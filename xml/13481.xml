<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="673908">It`s really an interesting continuation as a whole. I actually hate this kind of story nowadays (too intertwined, conflicts, high-stakes, etc), but this series capable of making me actually enjoy them. A lot of character developments, might be way better than the previous ones (long time ago, can`t remember well).

But that`s speaking story-wise with the addition of some LN deatails (look them up in the respective episode discussion in Reddit). Anime-wise this thing is botched. Even in isolation, there`re way too many unclear, low-quality, straight-up missed event, details etc. Adding the LN, you can see how a lot of things can go 180deg, or just completely gone. The details missing can go as far as 1:10, and 1:5 for a more important scenes.

Def good if you want to take the time to fulfill the holes by some more reading. The execution is just so bad that it could make me rate it an additional +2 or +3 if it`s a way better adaptation. The "potential" is just that utterly wasted.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="415669">I liked the firsts seasons of this anime but this one just screwed it up... Everything is extremely fast paced and so hard to follow. It`s as if they wanted to put 3-4 seasons into one... At least, the story finishes. So, if you want to know how it finishes, watch it. If not, don`t waste your time on it.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on a light novel series written by http://anidb.net/cr6886 [Kamachi Kazuma] and illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr6874 [Haimura Kiyotaka].
Located in western Tokyo is the enormous http://anidb.net/ch34367 [Academy City]. With a total population of over 2.3 million, roughly 80% of which are students, this city has a unique curriculum in place to develop supernatural abilities, and the students` abilities are rated in a range of six categories, from "powerless" at Level 0 to "super-powered" at Level 5.
A certain student, http://anidb.net/ch2342 [Kamijou Touma], is one of the students who lives in Academy City. An unusual power resides in his right hand: the illusion-canceling "Imagine Breaker," capable of nullifying even divine protection. For that reason, he is rated as "powerless," which puts him in danger of flunking out, and he spends his life plagued by misfortune.
As a result of a white-robed http://anidb.net/ch870 [Sister] falling out of the sky at the start of one summer vacation, Kamijou`s school life took an extraordinary turn. After meeting this girl, one "Index Librorum Prohibitorum," who claimed to be fleeing from the world of magic, Kamijou became caught up in all sorts of adventures. Through the balancing act of solving cases on both the science side, which controls Academy City, and the magic side, with which Index is linked, his circle of acquaintances gradually expands. Eventually, the http://anidb.net/ch26157 [Roman Orthodox Church], the largest denomination on the magic side, turns their attention toward Kamijou.
In response to the magic side, the science side`s Academy City also goes into action. However, there are others who step forward to resist the actions of a world that has abruptly started turning hostile. They are "heroes" who have greatly altered the course of fate through their interactions with Kamijou.
They also put their lives on the line to stand against both sides, just as Kamijou Touma has.
When science and magic cross paths a third time, the story really takes off!!

<name>horny nosebleed</name>
<description>In Japanese media, healthy young men who have no other sexual outlet will often suffer nosebleeds upon seeing the naked female body, or even just a pair of well-filled panties.
The nosebleed is, of course, a visual shorthand/euphemism for sexual arousal. It is commonly interpreted that way for males and females, with little trickles of blood indicating mild arousal, and gushing fountains of blood indicating erection/extreme arousal in both sexes. It can also be interpreted as shorthand strictly for erections in males. In that case, when blood shoots from the nose explosively, and in ridiculous quantity, the implication would be an ejaculation.

<name>extrasensory perception</name>
<description>Extrasensory perception (ESP), involves reception of information not gained through the recognized physical senses but sensed with the mind. The term was coined by Sir Richard Burton, and adopted by Duke University psychologist J. B. Rhine to denote psychic abilities such as telepathy and clairvoyance, and their trans-temporal operation as precognition or retrocognition. ESP is also sometimes casually referred to as a sixth sense, gut instinct or hunch, which are historical English idioms. The term implies acquisition of information by means external to the basic limiting assumptions of science, such as that organisms can only receive information from the past to the present.
In Japanese usage the term is often misappropriated to refer to any supernatural, non-magical, super power. Users of such powers are called `esper` in Japanese. The term `esper` is not normally in use outside of Japan but is slowly being introduced due to its usage in anime and manga.
In anime/manga the following powers, among others, are described as ESP:
- telepathy
- precognition
- clairvoyance
- retrocognition
- remote viewing
- aura reading
- out-of-body experiences (OBE)
- psychokinesis</description>

<name>air force</name>
<description>An air force, also known in some countries as an air army or air corps, is in the broadest sense, the national military organization that primarily conducts aerial warfare. More specifically, it is the branch of a nation`s armed services that is responsible for aerial warfare as distinct from an army, navy or other branch. Typically, air forces are responsible for gaining control of the air, carrying out strategic-bombing missions and providing support to surface forces.
The term "air force" may also refer to a tactical air force or numbered air force, which is an operational formation within a national air force. Air forces typically consist of a combination of fighters, bombers, helicopters, transport planes and other aircraft.</description>

<description>The character suffers from some kind of amnesia (memory disturbance or loss). This may mean inability to memorize new information, or inability to recollect old memories. Since there are many types of memory, the person may e.g. forget who they are but still retain learned skills.
Amnesia is fairly common in fiction as a plot device. In fact, because it allows for major plot changes while requiring little creativity from the author, it may be subject to heavy overuse.</description>

<name>loli</name>
<description>Lolita (often also just abbreviated to loli) refers originally to a novel by Vladimir Nabokov. The book is internationally famous for its controversial subject: the narrator and protagonist, middle aged Humbert Humbert, becomes obsessed and sexually involved with a 12-year-old girl named Dolores Haze.
Nowadays the name "Lolita" describes a sexually precocious young girl.
Related to this is http://anidb.net/t2415 [lolicon], the Japanese abbreviation of the English phrase "Lolita Complex". Sometimes written as "roricon" or "rorikon" due to the inexact mapping between Japanese and English phonemes. This is the term used to describe the fetish/fascination some mature people have for underage girls. There is an entire industry in Japan devoted to providing legal but schoolgirl-themed pornography, taking advantage of the cute childlike appearance some Japanese women maintain well into their twenties.
Because the characters in anime are often young by convention, many fans think that a character can only be Lolicon if she is twelve or younger. Exceptions are granted if the other character in the relationship is a lot older.
One particular device used to skirt the boundaries of taste and legality is the exotic being (alien, creature of magic, robot or the like) which takes the form of an underage human girl, but is in fact for all other practical purposes an adult.
Another reason why lolicon is fetishized by people may be because some of them just view it as a substitute for their fetish for flat-chested, but otherwise well-developed, women.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<description>Large breasts are breasts a fair notch larger than average, as found in some adolescent girls or fully grown women; however, as anime has no upper limit to breast size, the definition applies somewhat differently. To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>magic circles</name>
<description>A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised.
Traditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for non-magical work such as meditation.
Generally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<description>The conspiracy thriller (or paranoid thriller) is a sub-genre of the thriller which flourished in the 1970s in the US (and was echoed in other parts of the world) in the wake of a number of high-profile scandals and controversies (most notably Vietnam, the assassination of President Kennedy, Chappaquiddick and Watergate), and which exposed what many people regarded as the clandestine machinations and conspiracies beneath the orderly fabric of political life.
The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top".</description>

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

<name>war</name>
<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<description>Time in comics is flexible. Each panel shows a single event, which is usually accompanied by a length of dialog, which must take some time to say. This disparity is usually accepted if it isn`t taken to extremes.
But often, characters will exposit when it`s most needed: at the story`s climax, when both the intricacies of the plot and the intensity of action hit their highest.
While the Heroes Outrun the Fireball, Mr. Exposition might explain why the Evil Overlord`s death caused the explosion. The Action Girl can deliver impressive lectures on why the monster`s Achilles` Heel will work, while still engaging in Waif-Fu. The Superhero can quip to his heart`s content and explain his abilities while dueling one insignificant mobster, or deliver a Kirk Summation during the course of a single Finishing Move. Sometimes even apparent mere mortals can give a lecture on what is happening when it would be a much better idea to simply run like hell.
Without stopping to breathe, apparently.

<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<name>ensemble cast</name>
<description>A show with an ensemble cast focuses on a larger group of main characters in a single plot narrative; anime containing several segmented plot narratives (such as episodic or arc-based plots) are excluded. As such, it doesn`t really have a "main" or "lead" character; instead, every member of the central main character group plays an important part in the show`s grander scheme; no single character is more important or prominent than the others (equality of importance). Further, subplots (if any) lead by each character in the ensemble have equal weighting in importance (or lack of weight).

* In a show where no single main character is more important or prominent than the others, 4+ main characters is almost always an ensemble cast.
* A show with 3 main characters of equal importance is likely also an ensemble cast; equality of importance must be considered carefully.
* A show with 2 main characters of equal importance is generally not an ensemble cast situation; however, on an exception basis where neither main character is considered an antagonist, a 2-main-character anime may be considered an ensemble (e.g. http://anidb.net/a11829 [Kimi no Na wa.]).

<name>social commentary</name>
<description>Social commentary is the act of rebelling against an individual, or a group of people by rhetorical means. This is most often done with the idea of implementing or promoting change by informing the general populace about a given problem and appealing to people’s sense of justice. (Source: Wikipedia)&#13;
&#13;
Since this is anime, usually, the mores of Japan and the Japanese society are scrutinised, but not restricted to that.</description>

<description>It is not Red Bull that gives you wings, but power, most often even the power of love.
Whether it`s an android, a mecha, mons, a mahou shoujo, or basically any super powered individual, once they start powering up and become REALLY powerful, it will be indicated by them getting a pair of wings.
Specifically, feathery white angelic wings, sometimes also wings made of Hard Light or Pure Energy. These wings will of course allow the character to fly, float, and glow, all without needing to flap them!</description>

Feelings of any kind towards other characters are best shown by calling each other`s name, loud, REALLY LOUD. For better effect at least twice or thrice.

<description>Engrish is actually a mispronunciation of English, as can be the result of someone, who does not have English as their primary language of origin (such as Japanese or Chinese). Occasionally characters in the original Japanese dialogue version of an anime will speak in English... however; this often still requires the assistance of subtitles, for while the words are meant to be said in English, the sentence structure and letter pronunciation may still be strongly related to the person’s primary language.</description>

<description>Abbreviation for "three-dimensional computer generated animation" or "computer graphics" (CGI).

The difference lies in what lacks the traditional 2D animation all together and may give term to something produced entirely with 3D graphics (such as the 2006 remake of "Appleseed" , 2007`s "Vexille", the 2008 addition to the "Biohazard" series and the more well known "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within" and "Advent Children").</description>

<name>season</name>
<description>A season is a division of the year, marked by changes in weather, ecology, and hours of daylight. Seasons result from the yearly orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth`s rotational axis relative to the plane of the orbit. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth`s surface, variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.
During May, June, and July, the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun. The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December, January, and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere.
In temperate and subpolar regions, four calendar-based seasons (with their adjectives) are generally recognized: spring (vernal), summer (estival), autumn (autumnal), fall and winter (hibernal). Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring (prevernal) and late summer (serotinal) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four.

Her mind has been implanted with the 103,000 magical texts of the Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum as she possess Photographic memory at the cost of her own memories, or so the church authorities say. Her sorcery name is Dedicatus545. She is said to have 15% of memory space left to use in daily activities, which allows her to live normally for less than a year. However, all of this is a lie and are the church`s plan to make her unable to betray, by "maintenance" her once the memory has come to its limit.</description>

<name>Kamijou Touma</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kamijou Touma is the main protagonist of Toaru Majutsu no Index and a recurring character in its spin-off Railgun.
He has the lowest psychic rank possible at Level 0— largely because the people testing psychic abilities cannot detect or classify his abilities. Due to this, the founder of Academy City considers him neither a Psychic nor a Magician but rather a normal person with a unique ability.
Actually his power is Imagine Breaker (幻想殺し, Gensou Goroshi, "Imagine Killer"), a power which negates all magic, psychic, or divine powers but also his own good luck. He tends to stay away from trouble but possesses a strong sense of justice, albeit somewhat shallow and dogmatic. In order to save Index from the need of a memory reset, he had activated her self-protection system and destroyed the spell responsible for her mind strain but ended up losing all of his past memories, including everything about Index, when he came in contact with Feather of Light (光の羽, Hikari no Hane); this remains a secret to everyone except himself, the doctor that takes care of him (who is, unknown to Touma, the Heaven Canceler) and later Mikoto in the sixteenth novel. Though he no longer remembers the past, he has not completely forgotten the people he cares about.
Throughout the series, he tries to live his life normally while still facing against the many adversaries from the worlds of science and most of the magic and the conflicts that follow. Despite his very bad luck, he has managed to get the interests and hearts of many ladies who are infatuated with him, which Aisa jokes about, that his life is like a dating sim where he is bound to unlock more paths to more girls.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Misaka Mikoto is one of the series` main heroines, as well as the main protagonist of the side story, A Certain Scientific Railgun. Her parents are Tabigake and Misuzu Misaka, which her father is a prominent businessman and millionaire. Despite her rich background, she grew up in a normal typical childhood.
At a young age, she was discovered to be a Level 1 Electromaster, espers who have the ability to generate and control electricity. She enrolled into Academy City to train her powers and worked very hard until her powers were ranked Level 5, the highest esper ranking, with her being the third strongest of the seven espers with this rank. As an electromaster, she can generate and manipulate electricity which she can use to shock opponents, hack into electronics like computer networks and security systems, and use electromagnetism to cling to surfaces or manipulate iron particles into a chain-sword whip. Mikoto`s signature move is her ability to shoot metal projectiles such as coins at high destructive speeds, hence her nickname, The Railgun. If she is in a bad mood, she will sometimes let out bursts of electricity describing her emotional stress, usually resulting in power failures or even citywide blackouts.
Mikoto attends Tokiwadai Middle School, a famous girls` school for the rich and elite psychics and one of the five elite schools of Academy City. To most people, she is considered a proper lady, but in reality, she has a short-tempered, prideful, and improper attitude with some tomboyish tendencies and insecurities, a fact few other characters know. She is fond of cute, childish things, such as flowery pajamas and Gekota, the popular frog mascot franchise. Contrary to what she claims, she has a strong sense of morals and hates injustice. Mikoto has a one-sided rivalry with Touma, who nicknamed her Biri Biri (ビリビリ, relating to the sound of an electric shock), ever since their first meeting before the events of the first novel when he first dissipated her electricity after he unsuccessfully tried to rescue her. Since that incident, she is always trying to have a proper match with Touma and defeat him despite his many attempts to avoid conflict with her.
When Mikoto was young, she was tricked into giving the city`s scientist her DNA under the pretense of finding the cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy; their actual goal to create military-grade combat clones of her. When it was discovered that the clones did not have the same power level as Mikoto, they were instead used in an Project called Level 6 Shift, intended to make Accelerator the first level 6 esper by having him kill 20,000 clones. The events of how Mikoto tried to stop the project are briefly mentioned in the third novel and expanded upon in the Railgun manga. When all of her attempts failed, she contemplates letting herself be killed by Accelerator, as an unexpected variable to destroy Tree Diagram`s calculations. However, it is not until Touma intervenes and beats Accelerator, proving him to be really weak, that the project is canceled and the remaining 9969 surviving Sisters are spared.
After those events, she eventually develops strong romantic feelings towards Touma but is unable to express them due to her insecurities and the fact other girls are also interested in him. Even though she and Touma tend to bicker and argue with each other, they share a somewhat friendly relationship.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kanzaki Kaori is an eighteen-year-old Japanese sorceress from Necessarius. Unlike her partner Stiyl, she uses magic to magically strengthen her body. Her sorcery name is Salvare000, "Be the salvation of those who cannot be saved" (救われぬ者に救いの手を, Sukuwarenu Mono ni Sukui no Te o). She uses a two-meter-long nodachi called "Seven Heavens Seven Swords" as her weapon. She has a special attack called Nanasen (七閃, "Seven Flash") that uses her sword and some wires. She used to be a kind woman who treated Index like a sister, but when Index`s memories were deleted by Necessarius, Kaori changed into a cold and silent woman as Index no longer remembered her and consequentially did not trust her. After Touma saves Index`s life and her current memories, she decides to let Index stay at Academy City as she feels Touma can protect her.
Later in the novels, more of her past is revealed. Not only is Kaori a skilled swordswoman, but she is a Catholic Saint possessing the "Stigma" — the ability to call upon God`s power — and the former leader of the Amakusa Catholics; however, Kaori left the group as she resented that she had been fated since birth to become its leader, which led her to despise the concept of luck and fortune. Though she is Catholic, she joined Necessarius in hopes of changing her fate and befriended Index, developing a sisterly relationship with her. The repeated failed attempts to make Index remember her after each memory erasure resulted in her cold personality as Kaori began to accept that no matter how much a person tries, no one can change their destiny. She begins to show a kinder side to herself after Touma saves Index (thus giving her hope that anyone can defy their destiny) and gradually falls in love with him after he helps her face her past with the Amakusa Catholics, becoming more prone to showing emotion and sometimes showing a little embarrassment if she is with him. She is the protagonist of her own spin-off mini light novel bundled with the Toaru Kagaku no Railgun DVDs.

<description>Once the greatest magician in modern magic history, more than half of all modern magicians are affected by this man`s established theories, and two-fifths of them are direct followers of his ways. Having stretched the boundaries of sorcery farther than the advances made in the last few millenia alone and written many top-class spellbooks like The Book of the Law, it is no surprise that many mages were outraged when this eccentric genius literally "dumped" all his magic abilities and decided to "ace it" in the field of science, thus establishing the http://anidb.net/ch34367 [Academy City] and becoming its hidden monarch.
When he chose to stop using magic and was running for his life from a hoard of enraged stalker magicians, he met the http://anidb.net/ch14534 [Heaven Canceller], who eventually helped him found Academy City in a far-eastern island of Japan and also provides help in this ex-magician`s new goal; to extend his lifespan for as long as possible by having all but his consciousness rely on the power of machines.</description>

<name>Accelerator</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Accelerator is the most powerful Psychic in Academy City. His real name is unknown, though Accelerator recalls his surname was composed of two characters and his given name consisted of three characters. First appearing as an antagonist, he later becomes a main character and the lead of the science side in the Toaru Majutsu no Index series. Because Accelerator has been this reflexively powerful since childhood, he was unstoppable even when the military was sent to kill him. However, these past influences resulted in his inability to trust others and he was left alone. After meeting Touma, he develops a sense of admiration and jealousy towards Touma`s heroism and ability to help others, contrasting with how Accelerator feels he is only able to destroy.
A sadistic boy about the same age as Touma, he has an ability called Vector Change, a form of telekinesis allowing him to change the vector values of anything he touches. This ability allows Accelerator perform feats such as reversing the blood flow inside a person`s body, increasing the wind velocity around him to create a massive plasma storm, and blocking sound. His ability is automatic, which means that he must consciously allow gravity to affect him and that his body blocks all ultraviolet radiation, resulting his albino appearance (white hair and pale skin) because his body is unable to make melanin. The automatic nature of Redirection also prevents the use of projectiles (like bullets) and explosives (like bombs) against him. After being shot by http://anidb.net/ch14551 [Amai Ao], Accelerator`s ability to use his power is hindered, but slowly recovers with the help of http://anidb.net/ch14534 [Heaven Canceller] and the http://anidb.net/ch14538 [Misaka Network]. However, he is forced to use a cane and is restricted to using his ability for only 15 minutes at a time, as well as losing more than half of his computation ability even with 10,000 sisters doing calculations for him.
Accelerator`s unique ability make him the subject of an experiment attempting to create the first Level 6 psychic; according to the city`s best supercomputer, Tree Diagram (which was unprecedentedly destroyed by Index`s Dragon Breath), this feat could only be achieved by killing 128 skilled Level 5 psychics without a single failure. Since there are only six other known Level 5s in Academy City, an alternative plan was formed to level up Accelerator by having him kill 20,000 skilled Level 2 psychics: the Misaka clones. He willingly joins the experiment to gain a reputation as the most powerful and feared psychic that no one would be foolish enough to challenge and even killed many who got in his way. The Sisters` memories of his behavior during the experiment may suggest that he is, in a way, a pacifist; since his power won`t disappear, the only way he sees to stop fighting is to be so strong and sadistic that no one would raise a finger against him. He even seems to attempt to frighten the Sisters or otherwise encourage them to refuse the battle. Mikoto tries to stop the experiment to save her sisters, but it is Touma who finally does so and defeats Accelerator after discovering his weakness: Accelerator was physically weak because of his total reliance on his powers. Overconfidence in his psychic abilities resulted in his defeat as Touma beat him with his Imagine Breaker and street-fighting skills.
After his defeat, he reappears later and takes a more heroic role protecting a girl named Last Order, the last Misaka clone. In the aftermath of the incident, Accelerator is shot in the head by Amai Ao, damaging his brain and severely limiting the use of his power.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A blonde teenager who is always seen with sunglasses and wearing an Aloha shirt. He is a friend and classmate of Touma who just happens to be his next-door neighbor at the dormitory they`re staying at. While he seem like a normal, average teenager, there`s more to him than meets the eye. Secretly, Tsuchimikado is actually a former agent of Necessarius who became a freelance spy for Necessarius, Academy City, and other unknown organizations; the leaders of both Necessarius and Academy City are both aware of this but have decided to let him be for the time being. His sorcery name is Fallere825, `the back-stabber`.
He was formerly a skilled Onmyouji as his family are descendants of Abe no Seimei but gave up his abilities when he went under the ESP development curriculum. He has a younger step-sister named Maika, whom he is also in love with, and for this he is known as the Shisukon Gunsou (シスコン軍曹, "Sis-com Sergeant"). He is also a member of one of Academy City`s secret organizations, the "GROUP". His ESP ability is the Level 0 Auto Regeneration (肉体再生, Nikutai Saisei, lit. "Body Regeneration"). Due to this power, he can still use magic as he can repair the damage done to his body, making him the only successful psychic/magician hybrid. Despite these advantages, he avoids using magic except in the most desperate situations as he cannot avoid the extreme pain caused by using it.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Introduced in both the third volume of the novel and manga, respectively, and episode ten of the anime, Touma meets the younger `twin sister` of Mikoto who he calls Misaka`s sister (御坂妹, Misaka Imouto), who seems rather quiet and emotionless. Her voice is rather monotonous and computer-like. Her speech pattern is unique, for she talks in third person (adding a description of herself after she finishes talking). While both sisters may look alike from a distance, Misaka has paler eyes and wears striped panties under her skirt. Misaka also wears a special set of goggles that enables her to see electron beams and magnetic field lines for the reason that, unlike Mikoto, she does not have that ability. At the beginning of the third volume, Mikoto seems to dislike and worry about Misaka for some reason, and later events reveal why.
In reality, Misaka imouto is a clone of Mikoto; in fact, the first one Touma meets is No. 10032 out of 20,000 other clones (excluding Full-Tuning and Last Order) copied from Mikoto called `The Sisters`. Even though they have a weaker variant of Mikoto`s electric abilities (Level 3), the Sisters` minds are connected by a special psychic ability called Radio Noise (欠陥電気, Kekkan Denki?, "Flawed Electric"), which enables their brainwaves to become electric signals; this allows them to share their thoughts and memories within their communication network, also known as the Misaka Network. Being rapidly-manufactured clones, the Sisters rarely change their facial expression because they did not learn how to. Due to minds having connected to the Misaka Network, most of the Sisters never considered themselves human yet some of them had slight difference in personalities.
20,000 clones were created in total, to be used in an experiment designed to create the first Level 6 psychic ("Level 6 Shift"), Accelerator. By the time of third novel, 10,031 were killed in the experiment. After the Level 6 Shift experiment fails, all 9969 surviving Sisters are ordered back to the research center where they were created to have "readjustments" so that they will have normal life spans. The Sisters later began showing their owned unique personalities to differentiate themselves after learning how to `disconnect` from the Network and keeping their own private memories inaccessible to the others in the Network.
Misaka 10032, also known as Misaka Imouto, is the most prominent clone that is most featured in the series. She is known for having a soft spot for cats which she herself has a pet black kitten. She was the first sister clone that Touma met. Due to the many interactions she had with him, 10032 wonder why she thought about him so much. Misaka 10032 was Accelerator`s latest target in the Level 6 experiment, but Touma managed to stop him before he killed her. Confused, she asks him why he did so since she was a clone, to which he replied that even though she was a clone, she was still an individual with a life. His words (along with Mikoto`s) affect her so much that she and the Sisters decide to help Touma by controlling all of the city`s wind turbines to prevent Accelerator from creating a plasma storm.
After the Level 6 experiment was canceled, she was one of ten Sisters to stay in Academy City while the rest went overseas around the world for treatment. She later falls in love with Touma and receives a necklace from him (he bought it for her during his date with Mikoto and mistook 10032 for Mikoto) which she treasures.</description>

She is the administrator of the http://anidb.net/ch14538 [Misaka Network] and the fail-safe mechanism in case the Sisters got out of control. She is not designed to function independently and survive for long outside a culture container and appears to be only about ten years old. Due to intercepting an emotion program http://anidb.net/ch55166 [Nunotaba Shinobu] intended to install into all of the clones, she is capable of showing emotions unlike the other sisters and has a close relationship with Mikoto, http://anidb.net/ch14537 [Misaka Imouto], http://anidb.net/ch10527 [Accelerator] and her adult guardians, http://anidb.net/ch13691 [Yomikawa Aiho] and http://anidb.net/ch14552 [Yoshikawa Kikyou]. Like her older clone sisters, she speaks in third person with a description, except she says "Misaka" twice. She has all of the memories of the Misaka clones and has observed Accelerator through this method, posing a theory that Accelerator did not actually want to do the Level 6 Shift experiment.
Accelerator meets Last Order when she follows him home one day after he fends off a bunch of street thugs hearing of his defeat against a Level 0. Though Accelerator tries to dissuade her from hanging around him, she persists in following him around because she wants someone to keep her company. She is later kidnapped by http://anidb.net/ch14551 [Amai Ao] so he can infect the Misaka clones to possibly go on a rampage and attack people. Accelerator manages to stop him but gets injured in the process. Last Order and Accelerator are put under the care of Aiho after the incident. Accelerator does all he can to protect her since she is the first person in his life who requested his help. Throughout the story, she remains with Accelerator and has been involved in situations relating to him. After Accelerator`s confrontation with Aiwass, she is left in critical condition. However, Accelerator brings Last Order with him to Russia in hopes of finding http://anidb.net/ch870 [Index], who may have the knowledge to cure her.</description>

<description>Itsuwa is an Amakusa Catholic girl. Originally introduced in the 11th novel, she makes an earlier appearance in the anime episode http://anidb.net/e122298 [The Book of the Law] which is based on the beginning of the 7th novel. In the 11th novel, she fell in love with Touma after their first meeting, claiming it was Love at first sight but the anime suggests she fell for him much earlier during the Orsola incident in the 7th novel. However due to her shyness, she is unable to properly tell him how she feels. Yet she hopes to get Touma`s attention, even when knowing her senpai and superior Kaori is also in love with him. She has accompanied Touma and his friends on more than one occasion, including traveling with him to Italy, France, and Britain. In the events of the 16th novel she becomes his bodyguard and caretaker. When Acqua first attacks Academy City, she fails to protect him and unsuccessfully tries to heal him with magic due to his Imagine Breaker. After Touma is sent to the hospital she goes into despair for failing to protect him but Saiji rebukes her and tells her to snap out of it as she focus on fighting with Acqua if she wants to protect him. During the Amakusas rematch against Aqua, Itsuwa suddenly displays a change of personality, becomes full of tranquil fury that even the way she spoke changed. She performed a Saint Destroyer spell in that battle, harming Acqua and causing him to lose the Divine Mother`s Mercy spell which allows them to defeat him.
Her weapon is a Friulian Spear which by adding layers of reinforcement magic, turns it into a symbol of a `Thousand Years Tree`, which symbolizes the growth of plants and makes certain magic spells to be more potent over time. She also can perform Nanasen (七閃, Seven Flash) by manipulating her spear and steel wires just like Kaori.

<description>Musujime Awaki is a sophomore attending Kirigaoka Academy for Girls. She is a Level 4 esper with a teleport ability called Move Point (座標移動, Zahyou Idou). Her teleportation powers are more powerful than Kuroko as she can teleport anything weighing up to 4,500kg without even touching it by a distance up to 800 meters. However, due to a past trauma where she miscalculated and teleported her leg inside a wall, accidentally tearing her leg skin and muscles out from the wall and almost dying, she has a fear of using her powers on herself and feels physically ill whenever she is forced to teleport herself. This fear prevents her from becoming a Level 5.
She steals a remnant of the destroyed Tree Diagram and confronts Kuruko and Mikoto. However, she is beaten by Accelerator and the remnant is destroyed. Awaki is one of the guides to the windowless building where Aleister Crowley resides. She is also living with Tsukuyomi Komoe. Later, she is blackmailed to join team Group.</description>

<description>The Amakusa Catholics are a secret order of Japanese warriors. The order was formed during the Edo period when Japan banned Christianity. In order to escape persecution, they merge Shintoism and Buddhism into their Catholic beliefs to hid their religion which led the Amakusa`s creating a unique fusion of magic. While skilled magicians, the Amakusa`s are also skilled with martial arts and fighting in groups.

<description>Acqua is a member of God`s Right Seat. A former mercenary for the Anglican Church and an old friend of the current Grand Master of the Knights of England, Acqua`s true name is William Orwell. His sorcery name is Flere210, The one who changes the reason of tears. Blessed with the nature of The Power of God (Gabriel), Acqua converted to Catholicism and joined God`s Right Seat after leaving the Anglican Church. Unlike the other members of God`s Right Seat, he is not corrupt and does not ignore the opinions of the Pope. As a sorcerer, he cannot use spells that are used by normal sorcerers, but has been blessed with the spell Divine Mother`s Mercy, which nullifies the liabilities of certain special spells, allowing him to perform powerful spells under unfit conditions. He is a Saint, which endows him with super-human capabilities, including the strength to carry weapons twice as large as him; with Divine Mother`s Mercy nullifies the limitations of his body, he is able to use 100% of the capabilities offered to him as a Saint. As such, he demonstrates a considerable gap between his abilities and that of Kaori who is also a Saint. After his defeat in hands of the Amakusa Catholics and Touma in the volume 16, where he loses the Divine Mother`s Mercy, he returns in volume 17 in England wielding a replica of the dragon slayer sword, Ascalon, during the Magic Civil War as an ally of Princess Villian and Necessarius and fights his former friend and comrade, the Grand Master of the Knights of England. Acqua later heads to Russia, in order to stop Fiamma`s plans; on the way meets and saves Shiage and Rikou from a group of mercenaries. He ends up helping Accelerator and Hyouka against Archangel Gabriel and weakens Gabriel by absorbing its powers.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Hamazura Shiage is a former Skill-Out who accidentally gets caught up with the Dark side of Academy City.He is first introduced in the Side Story novels where he became the leader of his Skill-Out gang after Accelerator killed the former leader by orders of the Board of Directors. However, on the same day he became the new leader, his gang was hired to kill Mikoto`s mother, Misuzu but were defeated by Touma and Accelerator. Humiliated, he left the gang to his friend Hattori Hanzo and became a chauffeur and informant for Team ITEM where he fell in love with Rikou.
During the 15th novel, he betrays and fights ITEM`s leader Shizuri Mugino to protect Rikou and defeats her. However, his actions interfere with Aleister`s plans as he`s a rogue anomaly, so Aleister sends his assassins to eliminate him. Ironically, he is saved by Shizuri, who now has a sense of twisted love for him (declaring she will castrate him as her sign of affection) and lets him and Rikou escape Academy City who escaped stealing a jet since she doesn`t wants nobody else to interfere with her hunt. After he and Rikou jump out of their jet, they end up in a warzone in Russia where he is forced to fight Academy City mercenaries along with some villagers until they are saved by Acqua of the Back. He and Rikou later heads to Elizarina to find refuge there where Rikou is partially healed by Accelerator and fights alongside with Elizarinian soldiers and aiding Acqua. He later heads towards a nuclear military base (the same plant that Mikoto and Misaka 10777 are going) to protect a document called the Kremlin Report but he and Rikou gets caught up in an attack by Academy City forces and is then intercepted by Shizuri. But Shizuri collapses for using Body Clear and later makes the peace with Shiage and Rikou and joins them after learning about a secret document called the Parameter List which reveals the Academy City administration has been secretly interfering with the Power Curriculum Program and preventing most of the city`s students from gaining or raising their powers.
After the Third World War, Shiage is given amnesty and the assassination order on him removed and with the help of Accelerator, after he makes a deal with the City`s administration to not expose the truth about the Parameter List where he along with Rikou and Shizuri returns to Academy City and reforms Team ITEM. However, he and Accelerator actions have made them enemies with a new group of espers called the "Freshmen" who are aware of the existences of Magic and sees them as an obstacle in Academy City`s war against the Magic factions. After being helped by Touma and Leivinia Bardway against the "Freshmen", the latter invites him to join the Magic world.
As a Skill-Out gangster, he follows the gangs rules of not hurting innocents. While not nice or idealistic, he is smart yet acts on his own desires. In battle, he prefers to avoid fighting or to finish the fight as quickly as possible. He gets very embarrassed on sex-related issues.</description>
