<description>The trouble starts when a careless teenage...heaven dweller, neglects to change the tanks of the "soul laundry machine", which cleans souls that are going to hell. When the tanks explode, the heaven dwelling kid becomes possessed and turns into Janenba, a huge blob-like creature. Janemba changes the laws of the afterworld and creates much havoc, including bringing such characters back to life as Furiza and his minions and all of the other dead. Pikehan and Goku try to free the Demon lord and distract Janemba, it becomes evident that this tubby bastard`s magic is almost invincible. While Pikehan shouts insults at the Demon lord`s prison, Goku strikes back against the Jell-o menace. It looks as though Goku has won, when Janenba transforms into a smaller, deadlier fighter, whom Goku cannot defeat. When Vegita shows up, he too realizes that he cannot beat Janenba, so Goku convinces Vegita to fuse with him. Unfortunately, Vegita screws up the fusion dance, which is amusing in and of itself, and they turn into fat Gogita for 30 minutes. During this moment of weakness, Gogita gets the living snot beaten out of him. Meanwhile, Gohan, Videl, Goten, and Trunks are taking care of the masses of undead that now walk the Earth. They prove to be no match for our seasoned warriors. When the Fat Gogita transformation wears off, Pikehan buys Goku and Vegita the time to fuse correctly. In this new form of Gogita, Janemba is easily defeated and the rules of the afterworld return to normal and the generic happy ending ensues.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>henshin</name>
<description>Japanese for "transformation" (metamorphosis or disguise).
A "henshin anime" is any anime, where the characters or their costumes transform, such as Sailor Moon. The henshin switches on the character`s special powers, and is frequently accompanied by a costume change. Often the change of clothing is the only outward indicator that the character has changed and yet nobody seems to notice the hero`s true self.
Most henshin heroes have a special item which they use to change into their heroic form. These items are usually activated by a command phrase (which is often in Engrish, for some reason), triggering a transformation sequence.</description>

<name>Son Gohan</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Gohan is introduced as the first son of the primary protagonist, Son Goku, and his wife, Chi Chi, in volume #17 of the original manga, or the premiere episode of its animated adaptation, Dragon Ball Z. Gohan is the first Saiyan/Human hybrid in the series.
As opposed to full-blooded Saiyans, whose hair stays the same from birth, Gohan`s is drawn at varying lengths, and changes markedly in style. Many of Yamcha`s hairstyles are used by Gohan at various points in his life.
Initially, Gohan is illustrated garbed in a Hanfu-like surcoat with the Chinese character 孫, fixed on the front and the four-star Dragon Ball fitted on top of his hat. Piccolo later supplies him with a keikogi fashioned after Goku`s, but substitutes it with the demon character "魔" as a sign of his admission into the Demon Tribe. Normally thereafter, Gohan is drawn with a keikogi modeled after Piccolo`s own, with the anime recoloring his wristbands from blue to red and, during the Cell Games tournament, his obi from red to blue, despite reverting to the original colors for the former. On Namek, Gohan is portrayed in battle armor worn by Frieza`s henchmen, having been given it by Vegeta in preparation for their encounter with Frieza. Prior to his second fight with Majin Buu, Gohan asks Kibito for an outfit resembling his father`s, and is then drawn in a keikogi identical to Goku`s.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Mr. Satan (known as Hercule in the English adaptations) is a flamboyant martial artist. After http://anidb.net/ch2103 [Gokuu] and his companions stop attending the Tenkaichi Budoukai, Mr. Satan starts winning them and becomes the reigning champion for many years.
On a Q&amp;A with mangaka http://anidb.net/cr1902 [Toriyama Akira] published in Super Exciting Guide - Character Volume on April 3, 2009, it is revealed that Mr. Satan is just a stage/ring name and that his actual first name is "Mark". While it seems like a common name, it is actually written out in katakana as マーク (maaku). If you rearrange the syllables, as you would with many names in the series to derive their puns, you end up with akuma (meaning "devil" or "demon"), which is in concordance with his daughter`s name being a pun on the English word "devil".
During the Cell Games, he attempts to fight http://anidb.net/ch24822 [Cell], but even after being swatted away, he is given credit for Cell`s death by the media. He is soon called a world hero, gaining great wealth and a city named after him. Though Gokuu and his companions find his inflated ego and arrogance very annoying, he becomes close to them after befriending the good http://anidb.net/ch41758 [Majin Buu] and by helping defeat Kid Buu by using his appeal to the people of Earth to get energy for the Genki Dama. His daughter, http://anidb.net/ch12209 [Videl], marries http://anidb.net/ch9915 [Gohan].</description>
