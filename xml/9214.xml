<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="221885">It has some nice ideas &amp; elements, and at times feels almost epic. Sadly, it can be quite minimalistic in fights, and the conversations &amp; story are often sugar coated and naive. It`s far from an uncompromising Code Geass or Death Note, where killing people off when needed is the obvious thing to do.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="238891">Though it starts off quite interesting, it becomes more and more boring towards the end. The episodes start to consist more of only conversation and whole episodes are just spent standing in one spot. I wouldn`t really recommend watching it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="193384">It`s a mix between psychological and magical theme, with a touch of mystery and revenge story. It would make an interesting watch for anyone who`s a fan of those elements. If you find the anime good, check out the manga as well. It`s better in my opinion.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="231428">The episodes are just wow. Even though they are standing in the same spot for 2-3 episode, the plot makes up for the need for action big time. So far so good though</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="382731">very nice at the beginning, boring later. But i hope to get better during the end. The story is nice and characters are interesting.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="127948">Has been great so far with high production values and an interesting take on magic with intriguing characters, plenty of mystery and skillfully done action scenes. The hamlet quotes are a bit pretentious though.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="464392">This is one of the best anime that i`ve seen recently , at a certain point i was thinking : will i ever  find a jewel among the many horrible anime that recently aired. The only recomandation that i can give you is that it`s a MUST SEE , as simple as that. Why? watch it and find it yourself</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="301144">Was pleasantly surprised. One of the few anime that had me glued to my seat and watched it in 1 go. 
Little filler around the 2nd half, but overall it was pretty damn good</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="241461">I liked this anime, I loved the main characters they very clever, logical and to smart for their own good :D. the action was nice to and the plot was good.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="589244">For me it goes from good to mediocre to a conflicting mediocre/very good/very very good. The first episodes are more witty while the later episodes are more about suspicion and plot twists. Ironically, anime is better in the first half but it`s the second half that gets very addictive. And in the last episode they got me to smile, so yay! :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="487479">Very interesting got me hooked in a few episodes. This has potential to be one of my favorites. It has done amazing on every aspect thus far and I hope it ends well.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="578744">the first half was EPIC the last half wasn`t as good but it was good      even while standing at the same spot for 2-3 episodes it`s still EPIC!
the problem is that it gets worse every few
episodes</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="509126">This anime strongly surprised me. The philosophical question it raises regarding the extent to which the logic of the world controls your fate is very well developed in a passionate plot with strong characters, impressive visuals, and meaningful interactions. A must.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="459124">It is definitely worth your time if you love `logical` based animes. Although logic ... in anime ... Anyways, this one will make you feel good. There is a little part of it that feels forced, after the middle, but generally leaves you satisfied.
I loved the female characters. Especially Aika. And how brave and honest the `princess` is (you will understand).</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="88804">Maybe the best of this season. When you watch there are not the feeling of a movie. It´s theater, pure and simple so the references to "Hamlet" and "Tempest" are good to explain some particularities of these "magic". A Tragedie or a Drama? The anime walks the edge of a sword each episode until now (ep 12 only released). The characters are few  and complex with much inside talk - relevant talk. A must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="495005">This show blew my mind once I began watching it. It`s animation quality is superb, the plot given had me on the edge of my seat. Each ending has a cliffhanger that makes you wonder, "Wow, what will happen next?!" 
With Guns, Swords, Army, Bombs, Magic, Logic, and Philosophy all in a pack; this show is indeed worth the watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="271366">A very intriguing plot with many Shakespearean connotations, which I enjoyed. Minimally predictable for a psychological anime. A Must See for anime fans.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="413731">This show was amazing, from the art to the music to the story it was all amazing. Even though there was a lot of talking in this show, it is well worth it, hands down the best show that came out of its season</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="286304">Virtually everything about this anime is impressive. The plot, the characters, their individual behaviors, the art. I especially liked the glimpses into past relationships that are sprinkled throughout in a way that you only really get to see how it was near the end. The plot follows a similar course, which was interesting. The ending could have been better, but what truly matters to me are the interactions of these characters, their internal dialogues, the things left unsaid. All-in-all, I`d like to see lots more of this type of anime. But sadly, I think this is relatively unique. Definitely something to try if you haven`t already.</recommendation>

<description>An air force, also known in some countries as an air army or air corps, is in the broadest sense, the national military organization that primarily conducts aerial warfare. More specifically, it is the branch of a nation`s armed services that is responsible for aerial warfare as distinct from an army, navy or other branch. Typically, air forces are responsible for gaining control of the air, carrying out strategic-bombing missions and providing support to surface forces.
The term "air force" may also refer to a tactical air force or numbered air force, which is an operational formation within a national air force. Air forces typically consist of a combination of fighters, bombers, helicopters, transport planes and other aircraft.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>island</name>
<description>Part of this anime takes place on an island, a small landmass that is surrounded by the sea. Generally, an island setting involves interaction with "island" elements. Such elements could include (but is not limited towards): riding on a boat, fishing, foraging/hunting, beach scene, "peaceful island life", being "shipwrecked", island fever, lamenting isolation from the mainland, etc.
An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, cays or keys. An island in a river or lake may be called an eyot (also ait), or holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago.

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>hero complex</name>
<description>A hero complex is a state of mind in which an individual believes they need to save or assist others, uphold morals, serve justice, or perform other such supposedly hero-like acts, often at any cost. That is a common trait among vigilantes. Those with a hero complex may feel personally accountable for any failure at those self-assigned duties. Their main concern is performing their supposedly heroic deeds; any questions others might raise about such actions are all secondary concerns at best. Such questions can include, but are not limited to: who is to be saved; what are they to be saved from; why are they being saved; whether or not the other person needs or wants to be saved at all; whether or not others share in the sense of morals and justice being upheld; how people feel about the so-called heroic actions; whether people feel like those actions are being forced down their throats; what negative effects can arise from such actions.</description>

<description>While villains love to take over the world or cause the end of the world as we know it, the heroes are most likely motivated by the polar opposite, saving the world. A fairly simple plot/motivation related to for great justice and what not, this trope is pretty broad and very common for many stories not focused on character interaction only.

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

<name>Hanemura Megumu</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The current "Magician of Exodus". His powers started manifesting by the time of Aika`s death when he was chosen by the Tree of Exodus to replace her and got stronger when the Kusaribe Clan tried to revive it. Unlike the members of the Kusaribe Clan, who are capable only of healing and defensive magic, Megumu`s magic is solely focused on destruction and does not need any offerings to be activated. He first appears before Yoshino and Hakaze while looking for the Tree of Exodus, and despite Hanemura is labeled as the greatest threat to her, and was suspicious of being the one who killed Aika, Hakase decides to train him to ensure that he has the strength to stop the Tree of Genesis should her fears that all mankind will be destroyed when it fully awakens are confirmed. Megumu claims he had a girlfriend, whom he claims is his alibi for the time of Aika`s death, but was dumped by her recently.
