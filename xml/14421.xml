<description>Morgana is a mysterious cat-like creature whom Ren and Ryuuji first encounter in the dungeons of Kamoshida`s Palace, when they inadvertently stumble into it on what should have been Ren`s first day at Shuujin Academy. He teaches them the ins and outs of the Metaverse, Palaces, and Personas. He later appears to them in the real world as an ordinary domestic cat. Only people like them who have been able to enter the Metaverse can hear him speak in the real world, everyone else just hears him meowing. His true origins are a mystery even to him and he works as one of the Phantom Thieves in mostly in an attempt to seek answers, though he is convinced that he must have once been human. In the Metaverse he can also transform into a van which the Phantom Thieves can ride.</description>

<description>Amamiya Ren is the protagonist of the story. Originally coming from an unspecified small town, after intervening in a street altercation between a drunk man (who turns out to be the powerful politician Shidou Masayoshi) and a woman, he is convicted of assault, expelled from his former school, and sentenced to one year of probation. He is ordered by the court to transfer schools, with Shuujin Academy in Tokyo being the only one that would accept him with his criminal record. He is made to stay with Sakura Soujirou, who begrudgingly gives him a place to stay as a favour for Ren`s parents, who are acquaintances. As he serves out his sentence of probation, he begins to awaken to strange powers that might enable him to avert the coming ruin that is about to fall upon the world.</description>

<name>Niijima Makoto</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Niijima Makoto is a third-year honour student and the student council president of Shuujin Academy. Despite this status, she is actually rather unpopular, being perceived as cold and unapproachable by most of the student body, and after Kamoshida`s fall, as another authority figure who turned a blind eye to his abuses for her own selfish ends. Makoto is the younger sister of the prosecutor Niijima Sae. Their father, a police officer, was murdered in the line of duty three years ago, and after his death, Sae has had to work extra hard in order to support Makoto as well, which she resents, so Makoto has tried her best to excel in school so she could get into a good college and work to support herself as soon as possible.
After the Kamoshida incident, the Principal orders her to investigate the possibility that these so-called Phantom Thieves that claimed responsibility for his fall are students at the school, which leads her on the trail of Ren, Ryuuji, and Ann.</description>
