<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="414179">To keep it short, this one opens unlimited potential. Funny series, but there is no tension, not a slightest bit. Go there and there, one shot dragon there and there.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="677088">nice anime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="127005">I really liked this series. I don`t agree with the complaints about about a lack of tension. It is true that the `heroes` have an easy time in this series because of their technological (and magical) superiority, but that is actually why I liked it so much. No bullshit mistakes or choices or other weird things happening, just to make it more difficult (to build up tension), but letting happen what you would expect to happen. They just use the damn power that they have! I found this refreshing compared to other stories of any type.

Don`t know where the complaints about plot holes come from. The story seemed to jump a bit sometimes, but it didn`t bother me much.

The only minus point that I found were the typical dumb names of some characters :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="301225">Based on a popular light novel series, later translated to manga. Middleages/Fantasy meets modern Japanese military along with harem. It`s mostly politics and fights between middle age army vs modern army. Guess who will win? Surprisingly enough it`s the battles that are pretty enjoying to watch and the politics that were a bit boring, although it gets better throughout the series.
The fights include fantasy creatures at times as well which makes it original. However, the characters miss depth as there’s hardly any character development at all which results in somewhat shallow characters. I wish there was more drama as well.
I found season 2 to be slightly better. Overall a 7/10. Sadly, the anime only covers 2 volumes of a manga series that currently has 13 volumes and is still running. It ends with a hint for a 3th season but looks like it’s not coming.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="612872">Much like NGNL as mc in otaku but also loves harem(if you don`t like the genre don`t bare watch this) it sure is a must watch of the seasons mainly for its laughter and funny side</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="147092">Reminds me a little bit of No Game No Life.  MC is an otaku but can kick butt.  Great battle scenes and sprinkle of blood n guts.  Looks like a harem as well with a trio of elf, goth loli, and mahou girl.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="31156">It`s a lot like playing civ 4 on chieftain level.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="172963">Medieval fantasy army attacks modern army. Modern army beats the shit out of medieval fantasy army. With guns and tanks and choppers! It`s fucking awesome!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="623851">One of the best from 2015, a must see with good comedy and story. Can`t wait for more episodes.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="97537">neko mimi, usagi mimi, goth loli, yosei... 
otaku heaven</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="566648">Action, epic party and unusual setting of new VS old makes this show quite original and a good watch. You`ll like the characters and you`ll get vibes of Log Horizon with technology instead of adventurers.</recommendation>

<description>A gate appears in Tokyo`s Ginza district sometime in the 21st century. From the gate pour out monsters, knights from middle-age Europe and other fantasy-like beings, and they kill many citizens of Tokyo. This event is known as the Ginza Incident. The government sends a small group of soldiers from the Japanese Self-Defense Forces to the alternate world beyond the gate. Led by otaku soldier http://anidb.net/ch73921 [Itami Youji], they find that the villages in the world are being attacked by a dragon. An elf girl who is a survivor from the dragon`s rampage joins the group in their travels across the dangerous new world.

<name>juujin</name>
<description>Kemono, "beast", is a genre of Japanese art and character design that prominently features anthropomorphic animal characters. It is used widely in visual arts, especially drawing and painting, and can be found in many manga, anime, and video game.
Anthropomorphic animal characters in the kemono genre are frequently called juujin, "therianthrope"; the kanji for juujin are also sometimes pronounced kemonobito, "beast-human". While their design differs from artist to artist, they generally employ animal traits considered cute and endearing; most kemono characters retain a fundamentally human personality, however, seldom behaving as the actual animals from which they have been anthropomorphized, and as such they are typically depicted living as humans do.
Juujin leans more on the human-looking side when compared to http://anidb.net/t2857 [anthropomorphism], which leans more on the animal-looking side.

<name>elf</name>
<description>The origin of Elves (Norse; álfar(elves), álfr(elf)) can be found in ancient Norse mythology, in which, elves are described as divine, or near-divine, race of humanoids (Vættir), likened to the Æsir. In common description they are described as sage and immortal beings occupying the threshold between humans and the gods. In some cases humans that were beloved by the gods became elves within their lives. Ancient Elves are delineated into a pair of similar but distinct races; Light Elves (Ljósálfar) and Dark Elves (Svartálfar), each originating from separate homes within the nine worlds of Yggdrasil. Within the Poetic Edda the differences are commonly ascribed as:
"There is one place there that is called the Elf Home (Álfheimr which is the elven city). People live there that are named the light elves (Ljósálfar). But the dark elves (Dökkálfar) live below in earth, in caves and the dark forest and they are unlike them in appearance - and more unlike them in reality. The Light Elves are brighter than the sun in appearance, but the Dark Elves are blacker than pitch." (Snorri, Gylfaginning 17, Prose Edda)</description>

<description>An air force, also known in some countries as an air army or air corps, is in the broadest sense, the national military organization that primarily conducts aerial warfare. More specifically, it is the branch of a nation`s armed services that is responsible for aerial warfare as distinct from an army, navy or other branch. Typically, air forces are responsible for gaining control of the air, carrying out strategic-bombing missions and providing support to surface forces.
The term "air force" may also refer to a tactical air force or numbered air force, which is an operational formation within a national air force. Air forces typically consist of a combination of fighters, bombers, helicopters, transport planes and other aircraft.</description>

<name>maid</name>
<description>A maid is a female employed in domestic service. They usually wear uniforms. Since their nature is to be obedient and serve their goshujin-sama (master), they are one of the most desired types of women in Japan, a dream of every Japanese man, particularly http://anidb.net/t1133 [otaku]. Often seen in so-called Maid Cafes in Akihabara, where male customers can for a little time enjoy the feeling of being served by a woman. The male gender opposite is the butler.</description>

<name>loli</name>
<description>Lolita (often also just abbreviated to loli) refers originally to a novel by Vladimir Nabokov. The book is internationally famous for its controversial subject: the narrator and protagonist, middle aged Humbert Humbert, becomes obsessed and sexually involved with a 12-year-old girl named Dolores Haze.
Nowadays the name "Lolita" describes a sexually precocious young girl.
Related to this is http://anidb.net/t2415 [lolicon], the Japanese abbreviation of the English phrase "Lolita Complex". Sometimes written as "roricon" or "rorikon" due to the inexact mapping between Japanese and English phonemes. This is the term used to describe the fetish/fascination some mature people have for underage girls. There is an entire industry in Japan devoted to providing legal but schoolgirl-themed pornography, taking advantage of the cute childlike appearance some Japanese women maintain well into their twenties.
Because the characters in anime are often young by convention, many fans think that a character can only be Lolicon if she is twelve or younger. Exceptions are granted if the other character in the relationship is a lot older.
One particular device used to skirt the boundaries of taste and legality is the exotic being (alien, creature of magic, robot or the like) which takes the form of an underage human girl, but is in fact for all other practical purposes an adult.
Another reason why lolicon is fetishized by people may be because some of them just view it as a substitute for their fetish for flat-chested, but otherwise well-developed, women.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>parallel world</name>
<description>A parallel world, parallel universe, or alternative reality is a self-contained separate reality coexisting with our own. Because "alternative reality" sometimes implies that the reality is a variant of our own, like for example a mirror world, we use the term "parallel world/universe" which is more general, without any connotations implying a relationship (or lack thereof) with our own world/universe (meaning a fictional world can just as well have an alternative reality, it doesn`t need to be our reality). To put it more simply, this category is to show if more than 1 world/universe/reality is present in the anime.
Multiple timelines of the same world/universe/reality are NOT considered parallel worlds. For example, in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate] the cast travels through multiple "World Lines", which are defined as parallel timelines of the same universe had various events occurred with differing outcomes.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<description>Alcohol (or more scientifically, ethanol), is one of the world`s oldest psychoactive substances. It is traditionally found in the form of a beverage such as beer, wine, or liquor, although in some contexts it can be inhaled to produce similar or intoxication, and some people prefer another way of consuming beverage-form alcohol.
Alcoholic beverages are many and varied, due to production methods (fermentation or distillation), source materials (grains, fruits, vegetables, other plants), added substances such as flavorings, and many more ways of defining different forms of alcoholic beverages.
Alcoholic beverages are divided into three general classes: beers, wines, and spirits. They are legally consumed in most countries, and over 100 countries have laws regulating their production, sale, and consumption. In particular, such laws specify the minimum age at which a person may legally buy or drink them. This minimum age varies between 16 and 25 years, depending upon the country and the type of drink. Most nations set it at 18 years of age.</description>

<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<name>narration</name>
<description>The most common example is that of a voice, either that of one of the characters or entirely unrelated, that appears at the beginning of an episode to offer a summary or introduction, and at the end of an episode for closure or for a preview to hint upon what to expect next.
Another use of narration comes in the form of a dominant voice belonging to one of the protagonists, intended only for the viewer and revealing the intimate thoughts to whom it belongs. This type of narration occurs frequently throughout the duration of the episode or movie.</description>

<name>propaganda</name>
<description>Propaganda is communication aimed at influencing the attitude of a community toward some cause or position. As opposed to impartially providing information, propaganda in its most basic sense, presents information primarily to influence an audience. Propaganda often presents facts selectively (thus lying by omission) to encourage a particular synthesis, or uses loaded messages to produce an emotional rather than rational response to the information presented. The desired result is a change of the attitude toward the subject in the target audience to further a political agenda.</description>

<name>isekai</name>
<description>An isekai story is one in which the lead characters are transferred to and become stuck or trapped in another world, one completely different from the one they lived in up until the transfer. The new world is commonly a http://anidb.net/t2628 [fictional world], such as a http://anidb.net/t2838 [parallel world] or http://anidb.net/t2839 [virtual world] (other fictional world types can also apply). What defines the isekai genre is that the characters are sent to another world, often but not always a parallel one, and they generally cannot come back permanently without meeting a highly specific goal.
In order to adapt to their new environment, they must use the abilities and knowledge brought from their former world as well as any that may have been bestowed upon them by their brave new world. In some cases, they will seek and eventually find a way to return; in others, they will gleefully embrace their new life.
http://anidb.net/a144 [Inuyasha] is an example where isekai applies to a fictional world that is not also a parallel or virtual world. http://anidb.net/ch7246 [Higurashi Kagome] climbs down an ancient well at her grandfather`s shrine and is transported to feudal Japan (time travel). While she eventually gains the physical ability to travel back and forth between her time period and feudal Japan, her bonds and responsibilities to feudal Japan tie her there until they are ultimately resolved.
For clarity, below is an illustrative example where isekai is applied to a non-fictional, non-parallel, non-virtual world.

* The main characters are from Earth. One day, they are abducted by Nazis from Mars (alternate "world") are brought back to their Martian base. The main characters are trapped on Mars. Their only escape is to defeat the Nazis and steal their spaceship to return to Earth (specific goal required to escape); they are left to thier own devices, with no prospect of help from Earth, and no way to contact Earth.

<summary>Youji has brought his platoon and the small group of refugees back to the JSDF base camp at Arnus Hill near the Gate. His decision to do this stirs up controversy in the upper ranks. The girl Leilei proves able to learn Japanese rather quickly and becomes interpreter. They are fascinated by modern technology but are concerned that they must find a way to repay all the help they are being given. They see a battlefield full of dead dragons killed by the JSDF during the last battle, and attempt to harvest the dragon scales and trade them at the nearby city of Italica.
At the same time, Pinya travels throughout the lands and hears stories of the doings of the JSDF from some of the survivors of Coda Village. She finds one of the imperial vassal kings, badly maimed after the battle at Arnus Hill, who tells her of the slaughter and how he realises how they had been used by the Emperor. She resolves to visit Arnus Hill and see these invaders for herself. They also have to pass through Italica to get there.
Meanwhile, back on Earth, the President of the People`s Republic of China makes plans to colonise the land beyond the Gate as well. Garbled reports of the incidents involving Youji`s unit serve to make a public relations nightmare for the Japanese government, and the exploration of the land beyond the Gate continues to lose popular support. The Diet of Japan summons Youji and his refugees, but by then they have already departed.</summary>

<summary>Youji goes down the well to pull up the woman, a blonde-haired elf maiden. The Third Reconnaissance Platoon then returns to the nearby village of Coda with the still-unconscious elfmaid and tell the mayor about the dragon, which terrifies them, and they make preparations to evacuate. Youji asks the mayor what happened to the lord who ostensibly ruled over their lands and why he wasn`t doing anything to help with the dragon, and was told that their lord never returned from the last battle near the Gate.
While the Platoon helps guide the villagers away from the dragon a group of bandits thinks to attack them and in so doing become their new lord. A demigoddess named Rory Mercury slaughters them without mercy. The next morning she meets with the village and the Platoon, and seems to take a liking to Youji.
Soon enough, the dragon attacks them, and kills a sizeable number of villagers. Even modern weapons are at first ineffective against the dragon, until the elfmaid and Rory help the platoon to injure it badly enough that it is driven off.
After the villagers bury their dead, most of them are able to settle in other villages where they have kin. The young apprentice of an old magician, named Leilei, the elfmaid, Rory, and a few others remain with the Platoon.</summary>

<summary>The JSDF expeditionary force remains camped just outside the Gate on the other side, and decimates the allied forces that attack it, their medieval-level technology no match for modern weaponry and military tactics. This is, however, actually a gambit by Emperor Molt to weaken the kingdoms that are only nominally under his authority and keep them from rebelling. With their armies largely destroyed they are unable to resist his subsequent scorched-earth tactics. The emperor`s daughter, Pinya, is ordered to lead her order of knights to investigate the JSDF and learn all she can about them.
Meanwhile, back on Earth, the President of the United States considers sending an American force beyond the Gate as well, lured by the prospect of immense resources in the lands beyond, despite the political implications. Domestic opposition in Japan to the JSDF`s operation beyond the Gate is mounting as well, so the President is convinced to bide his time.
Youji is made commander of a reconnaissance unit whose job is to make contact with the locals and establish friendly relations with them. Along the way, they find a dragon burning a village. When they reach it after the dragon leaves, they find a woman at the bottom of a well, apparently the only survivor.</summary>

<summary>Itami Youji is a 33-year old otaku who enlisted in the Japan Self-Defence Forces to support his hobby. He is in Ginza to attend a doujin event when what becomes known as the Gate opens, and warriors and monsters enter and attack the people. His presence of mind and valour in the face of the unprecedented events helped save the lives of many civilians, and he is acclaimed as the Hero of Ginza, and even receives a personal citation from the Prime Minister himself, and is promoted to second lieutenant. The mysterious Gate remains open, and while no more creatures have come in from the other side, the Japanese Government remains deeply concerned, and they assemble an expeditionary force to explore the mysterious land beyond the Gate. Youji is of course chosen to be part of this force.</summary>

<summary>The five girls from the Special Region pass through the Gate with Itami`s unit, and are astounded by modern Tokyo. A Public Safety intelligence officer named Komakado meets them and escorts the group to the Diet. Pinya and Bozes are not part of the official delegation and attend a private meeting with cabinet officials in preparation for a possible future peace conference with the Empire. At the same time, Leilei, Tuka, and Rory are brought before the Diet into what becomes a sensational public hearing. Some members of the Diet opposed to the JSDF`s operations beyond the Gate try to paint Itami`s attempt to save the villagers from the dragon into a bad light, but the three girls are having none of it, and stress that the lieutenant did the best he could under such difficult circumstances, and in so doing humiliate their spokeswoman.
Komakado is concerned about possible attempts on the Special Region girls, and so gets them to leave the Diet using the subway rather than the cars they were expected to use, which are promptly attacked. Whoever is attempting to capture them also seems to have control over the subways as certain lines they are about to use inexplicably fail. They are attacked by a man in the street who tries to take Rory`s axe, which is incredibly heavy, which incapacitates both the attacker and Komakado who both unwisely attempt to lift it. To hide them, Itami brings the girls to the house of a famished young woman whom he introduces as his ex-wife.</summary>

<summary>The Rose Knights treat Itami very roughly as they bring him back to Italica, so much so that he is knocked unconscious. Pinya is livid, as they have then violated the treaty so soon after it had been agreed upon and she fears that the JSDF will use the incident as a pretext to attack, so she orders Bozes Co Palesti to make it up to Itami with her body. In the meantime, Itami`s platoon sneaks into the city in an attempt to rescue him, to find that he is being well cared for by several semi-human maids and they have a small party. Bozes arrives and slaps Itami after she sees that he seems to be having fun.
Pinya and Bozes join Itami`s group as they return to the camp at Arnus Hill, and along the way they see further evidence of the JSDF`s overwhelming military might as they conduct a training exercise. Pinya speaks to General Hazuma, the commanding general of the JSDF forces at Arnus Hill, apologising for the incident. The next day, she joins Leilei, Tuka, and Rory as part of the delegation from beyond the Gate for the audience with the Diet of Japan.</summary>

<summary>The fighting continues at Italica. The eastern gate`s defences are breached, and there is fighting in the city. Rory goes into a battle frenzy, with Itami`s troops behind her. Itami has also called in a squadron of helicopter gunships, and they terminate the bandits with extreme prejudice. This awesome display of modern military firepower leaves Pina in a state of shock, and she realises that a war with them would result in their inevitable defeat. She is equally shocked that Itami does not demand crippling terms which the victors in such a battle usually do, merely requesting trade concessions in exchange for the continued sovereignty of Italica. Leilei sells the dragon scales, and the 3rd Platoon tries to return to the JSDF basecamp at Arnus Hill, only to encounter Pina`s Rose Knights, who do not yet know that the battle is already over and that Pina has negotiated an armistice. They threaten Itami, who allows himself to be captured, ordering his troops to leave him behind, to avoid more fighting.</summary>

<title xml:lang="en">The Battle of Italica</title>

<title xml:lang="x-jat">Italica Koubousen</title>
<summary>Many of the soldiers who survived the battles at Arnus Hill against the JSDF have turned to banditry, and Pina finds herself in command of the defenders as Italica is besieged by these bandits. The city, after the sudden death of its lord recently is nominally ruled by the late lord`s daughter Myui, who being only eleven obviously cannot lead the defence, and so Pina and her Rose Knights offered to do so.
During a lull in the fighting, Itami`s platoon, with Leilei, Rory, and Tuka arrive, and convince Pina that they are friendly and are willing to help defend the city. This is Pina`s first true battle: her Knights were relegated solely to a ceremonial role before, and she is not doing well. She had Itami`s platoon guard the south gates, as they are the most difficult to defend, but that night the bandits unexpectedly attack the east gate and overwhelm their defences. She thinks of calling Itami to help but fears he will not come after having put him in what looked like a suicidal position. It seems though that Itami will help of his own initiative.</summary>

<summary>The American paramilitary officers approach the Hakone resort unchallenged, only to find that there are also Russian and Chinese paramilitaries there, apparently on the same mission. A bloodbath ensues when Rory joins the fray, and eventually all of the invaders are killed. Itami`s party escapes by commandeering the van used by the American paramilitaries, and they drive back to Tokyo. Itami`s ex-wife Risa spreads the word that the girls will be heading back through the Gate that afternoon, so a large crowd gathers at Ginza to see them off.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has resigned, removing the blackmail leverage that the Americans had, but the Central Intelligence Agency is still attempting to abduct the girls, planning to take them just as they arrive at Ginza, since the assurances of the previous administration should still hold. However, Komakado has arrested all the foreign intelligence agents in the area, including the CIA ones, saying that he has no way of verifying whether any such agent he finds is with the CIA or not, foiling their plans. Itami`s party thus returns to the Special Region unmolested.</summary>

<summary>Itami`s group spends the night at his ex-wife`s home, and decide what to do next. He has the girls go out for a bit while he meets with the Minister of Defence, who is an old friend, and he is ordered to bring their guests to the Hakone Mountain resort that had been prepared for them and is guarded by elite Japanese special forces. Itami brings them there as ordered, and after they are settled there is fighting just outside as several groups of enemy commandos make their way to the resort. The Japanese special forces unit manages to neutralise most of these mysterious enemy forces. However, President Dirrell blackmails the Prime Minister with reports of government corruption and convinces him to get the unit guarding the resort to withdraw, so that the American commando unit can abduct the girls from the Special Region with no interference. Rory Mercury is heavily affected by the fighting outside the resort and tries to seduce Itami.</summary>

<summary>Yao goes around the settlement of Arnus and the JSDF basecamp, but is unfortunately unable to make herself understood to the JSDF soldiers she meets. She falls prey to thugs and robbers but is able to defend herself but one of them reports her and she is eventually arrested by MPs. Leilei, being the best bilingual speaker manages to get her story and the thug is instead taken into custody, and she eventually secures for Yao an audience with General Hazama. Yao explains her errand, but the General refuses to help. The settlements of Yao`s people can only be reached by crossing imperial territory, and if he sends enough forces there to defeat the dragon that would be interpreted by the Empire as an act of war. Frustrated in her mission, she overhears stories about Itami and how he might manage to do something to help, and so when she goes to the refugee dormitories she asks Tuka about him.
Itami meanwhile has escorted a second diplomat to join Pinya, and is being sent as part of a delegation to the capital.</summary>

<summary>Itami`s squad and the girls have returned from Japan. The JSDF basecamp at Arnus Hill has become the centre of a thriving town as trade across the gate between the Special Region and Japan flourishes. Pinya and a Japanese diplomat have begun meeting with imperial nobles, attempting to convince the most hawkish of them to consider peace with Japan by giving them gifts and negotiating the release of important prisoners of war captured during the first assault by the Empire against Japan.
Meanwhile, Itami is at a tavern with Rory, who is still trying to seduce him. A dark elf woman named Yao Ha Dyusshi appears, looking for what she calls the "green men" (the JSDF) trying to get their help. She denounces Itami for apparently corrupting a minor, and her interference irritates Rory. She makes the misunderstanding deep enough that the Yao draws her sword on Itami, who flees. It turns out that Yao is looking for help to finally finish off the fire dragon that Itami`s group encountered earlier, and offers a huge diamond as reward.</summary>
