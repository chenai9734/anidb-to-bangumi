<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="382591">Watch this if you like extremely dystopic and dark atmosphere and lot of things that forces you to think about what is going on.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="192495">Bleak, but moving.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="341304">A very atmospheric, intelligent, and bleak series. This anime sticks out from the bunch, but in a good way.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="558440">A classic feel trip of despair from start to finish. Not for everybody, but I can attest to this being a masterpiece.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="638653">The pacing is strange. It starts very slow at first. Almost impressionistic rather than script driven. Give it a few episodes. It becomes more cohesive as it progresses. The drawings of the musty streets and sewers are beautiful. Somehow, the gorgeous art is the carrot that beckons the viewer forwards to the thoughtful plot at the end.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="303392">If you are fan of cyberpunk and you liked pieces like SE Lain or Ergo Proxy, this is heaven for you. Disturbing and hard plot, complicated characters and very good ending. May be confusing at first glance and requires good deal of attention from watcher, but is ssso worth it.

But be vary - if you don`t want to think very hard on the plot, don`t watch it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="98409">Artistically bleak and quite complex. The main character is a bit too dull (and falls over more times than you can count), but a rarely good watch nevertheless.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="346749">It is really THE show to watch if you`re looking for a complex story. Once the puzzle is set whole, you`ll get shocked!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="20064">Great Art.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="54185">The write of Lain can`t go wrong. Another masterpiece of atmosphere, animation and story. Makes you think a lot.</recommendation>

<description>In the vibrant yet dilapidated underground city of Lux, the denizens have come to call it "The City" and treat it as a sentient force.
Three factions vie for control of the city: the Organo, a strictly professional conglomerate with ties to the criminal underworld in the prosthetics business (Texhnolyze); the Union, a fanatical populist group interfering with Organo`s affairs; and Racan, a marauding group of Texhnolyzed youths.
Trying to get by on a daily basis are: http://anidb.net/ch9665 [Ichise], a stoic prize fighter who loses a leg and an arm to satisfy an enraged promoter; http://anidb.net/ch9668 [Oonishi Keigo], a young but level-headed executive of the Organo who has many enemies; and http://anidb.net/ch9669 [Ran], a little girl who has a very important gift that affects the entire city. As they struggle to accept the challenges that they are dealt, they bear witness to major events that determine whether the city continues to exist.

<name>insane</name>
<description>Insanity, craziness, or madness is a spectrum of behaviors characterized by certain abnormal mental or behavioral patterns. Insanity may manifest as violations of societal norms, including a person becoming a danger to themselves or others, though not all such acts are considered insanity; likewise, not all acts showing indifference toward societal norms are acts of insanity.
In modern usage, insanity is most commonly encountered as an informal unscientific term denoting mental instability, or in the narrow legal context of the insanity defense.
A more informal use of the term insanity is to denote something or someone considered highly unique, passionate or extreme, including in a positive sense. The term may also be used as an attempt to discredit or criticise particular ideas, beliefs, principles, desires, personal feelings, attitudes, or their proponents, such as in politics and religion.

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>dystopia</name>
<description>A dystopia (from Ancient Greek: δυσ-, "bad, ill", and Ancient Greek: τόπος, "place, landscape"; alternatively cacotopia, or anti-utopia) is, in literature, an often futuristic society that has degraded into a repressive and controlled state, often under the guise of being utopian. Dystopian literature has underlying cautionary tones, warning society that if we continue to live how we do, this will be the consequence. A dystopia, thus, is regarded as a sort of negative utopia and is often characterized by an authoritarian or totalitarian form of government. Dystopias usually feature different kinds of repressive social control systems, a lack or total absence of individual freedoms and expressions and constant states of warfare or violence. Dystopias often explore the concept of humans abusing technology and how humans individually and collectively cope with technology that has evolved too quickly such as the car, the flamethrower or the microwave. A dystopian society is also often characterized by widespread poverty and brutal political controls such as a large military-like police.</description>

<name>downer ending</name>
<description>A finale that ends the story in a way that is usually truly miserable and tragic or a similarly low-key or unhappy ending to a normally "happy" series. 
Cruel examples of the ways this ending happens are all the major characters dying or the "bad guy" winning in a way that there`s no sight of happiness in the end.</description>

<name>dark atmosphere</name>
<description>Usually metaphorical. Sometimes literal. At times both!
Typically this refers to the fact that the story is set in a grim, dog eat dog milieu — for example a decaying city.
Often the characters are just doing what they need to do to survive, with little or no expectation that their lives can be better. And often characters may feel they do not have any real choice in what they do.
And yes, occasionally the setting is actually dark — be it night or perpetually heavy cloudy sky and rain. It all adds to the oppressive, hopeless feeling of the show.
You probably will not feel uplifted or happy after watching this anime.</description>

<name>mind fuck</name>
<description>A `mind fuck` is a slang term which describes a work that uses literary devices such as nonlinear storytelling and plot twists in order to present convoluted, yet not conflicting, themes.
A creation is usually considered a mind fuck when a casual observer is not able to discern the true meaning of a work without making a serious attempt to unravel the themes presented or when the plot is incredibly difficult to follow.
Special examples of mind fucks involve a single plot twist which completely changes the viewer`s understanding of the events in a film or novel as well as the ideas it presents.</description>

<description>Up to the very end of the anime the viewer will hope that the story will end well and that the characters will in some way be able to solve the problems.
Not so. The sense of foreboding doom could not be averted. The social or personal calamity strikes mercilessly.
Examples: The catastrophic meteor strike does hit Earth after all. The long sick loved one cannot be saved. After overcoming all obstacles a random cruel event ends the life of the protagonist. A almost forgotten tragedy in the past has repercussions in the present.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Ichise lost his parents in early childhood and, not having any relatives, was left all alone in the world. Coming from the wrong side of the tracks, life has been tough for him. He`s been forced to survive only on his own devices without anyone to open up to. The only thing which the generally reticent and expressionless Ichise shows a strong sense of attachment to, is the capsule containing his dead mother`s body cells. Under the cold mask, he may be desperately longing for family affection. Ichise lives hand-to-mouth as a boxer in "fight-to-the-death" betting matches called "games". However, he was punished by a violent group of men for crossing the game promoter`s mistress and loses an arm, his only means of survival, along with everything else.</description>

His cool and collected personality and his competence have quickly accelerated his rise to the top within the Organo. He also seems to be a man of duty and respect. Despite his busy schedule, Onishi makes it a point to regularly visit Gotoh, the head of Organo, in the hospital.</description>

<description>Ran, is a girl who lives in Gabe and sells flowers in Lukuss and has psychic abilities. She is a "Seer", a person who can see the possible near future. Because this ability causes her to see things that she does not want to, Ran tends to shut herself off from the world within her mind. Will the future of Ichise and Lukuss in her eyes somehow become a key to this story?
In Gabe, Ran is considered to be sacred (her current position is apprentice-priestess) and therefore she is protected. Any harm done to Ran is harm done to Gabe, and for this reason, she can move around Gabe and Lukuss in a relatively free manner.</description>

<description>He is the leader of Racan, a group of young, city punks. He shows some promise as a leader, because he does not resort to violence unnecessarily and is capable of sensing the members` concerns about himself and about the group`s future. Not knowing exactly what to do, however, he leads a "take-it-easy life". Shinji values "freedom" more than anything, and because of that, he does not restrict his girlfriend Yoko`s actions, so much to the extent that he appears indifferent to her. But Shinji, who makes "freedom" his life`s principle, also has a longing to become part of the privileged class called "The Class". It seems that what he truly wants in his life is not something he can get by remaining where he is.</description>

<description>She is one of "The Class", the group of people who live on the Hill. This first-rate expert in texhnolyzation came to the city of Lukuss to advance her studies. More of a scientist than a doctor, she sees texhnolyzation as a means of human evolution rather than medical treatment. Her display of strong possessiveness toward Ichise, such as desperately trying to find him after he runs away from the lab, indicates that Ichise is a vital test subject in her experiments. Despite her general cleverness, she occasionally shows a nervous, childish side.</description>
