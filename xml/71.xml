<description>http://anidb.net/ch7034 [Tylor] again and again has beaten the odds. With volumes in this series ranging from character sidestories to devastating new weapons deployment, he and the http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze] crew have dealt with hardships.
The shooting war is over. The undefeated Soyokaze has returned home and all should be right in the universe. It`s not... the http://anidb.net/ch7064 [Raalgon Empire] has created an incredibly powerful and destabilizing new weapon system. With the urging of the Prime Minister, they`re about to deploy it and when the UPSF forces realize this the choice is clear. These are desperate times...</description>

<description>The military, also known as the armed forces, are forces authorized and legally entitled to use deadly force so as to support the interests of the state and its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its citizens and the prosecution of war against foreign powers.

<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Christmas</name>
<description>Christmas, also referred to as Christmas Day, is an annual holiday celebrated on December 25 that commemorates the birth of Jesus of Nazareth. The day marks the beginning of the larger season of Christmastide, which lasts twelve days. The nativity of Jesus, which is the basis for the Anno Domini system of dating, is thought to have occurred between 7 and 2 BC. December 25 is not known to be Jesus` actual date of birth, and the date may have been chosen to correspond with either a Roman festival or the winter solstice.
On the Julian calendar, followed by most Orthodox churches, Christmas Day also falls on O.S. December 25th; this corresponds to N.S. January 7th on the Gregorian calendar, followed by Western churches.
Modern customs of the holiday include gift-giving, Church celebrations, and the display of various decorations—including the Christmas tree, lights, mistletoe, nativity scenes, and holly. Santa Claus (also referred to as Father Christmas, although the two figures have different origins) is a popular mythological figure often associated with bringing gifts at Christmas for children. Santa is generally believed to be the result of a syncretization between Saint Nicholas and elements from pagan Nordic and Christian mythology, and his modern appearance is believed to have originated in 19th century media.
Christmas is celebrated throughout the Christian population, but is also celebrated by many non-Christians as a secular, cultural festival. Because gift-giving and several other aspects of the holiday involve heightened economic activity among both Christians and non-Christians, Christmas has become a major event for many retailers.</description>

<name>space is an ocean</name>
<description>The difference between space and ocean is marginal. In fact the two are completely interchangeable. Spacecraft are usually called ships and space forces use naval ranks. Movement in space is two-dimensional. There is friction. And not to forget space pirates are roaming through the galaxy and just so often you will encounter space whales.
Some titles take this even a step further by actually displaying the space as a sort of gigantic liquid mass.</description>

<name>space opera</name>
<description>Space opera is a sub-genre of fiction that emphasizes romantic adventures in space. Space opera generally involves large-scale conflicts between opponents with powerful abilities and technology. The genre will often be melodramatic, sometimes playing music that can be nothing short of awesome. Warfare and a battle of wits are usually less emphasized, preferring romance (with exceptions, e.g. Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu). Some space operas tend to be formulaic and sometimes even prosaic, often employing very simple devices and somewhat obvious strategies. An example of this would be the infamous laws of physics in the Macross universe, in which the main male lead will hardly ever get hit in battle.</description>

<description>The 16-year-old empress of the Holy Raalgon Empire. Azalyn is a child, forced into the unenviable situation of having to assume power of the empire once her parents are murdered. Prompted by her advisors, she gives the command to attack the UPSF (assuming that they were behind the assassination plot). Having not had a chance to be a child, Azalyn must now be strong for the entire empire, and it`s a task that she is afraid of taking, but even more afraid of failing.</description>

<description>Lt. Commander Yuriko Star is another by-the-book officer. Yuriko joined the UPSF to give her life structure and attepts to obey the rules in almost every situation. However, she, unlike http://anidb.net/ch7036 [Yamamoto], has no problem telling http://anidb.net/ch7034 [Tylor] that he has done something wrong and will even resort to slapping him when he gets too far out of line. Yuriko also tries to downplay her gender, making herself a soldier first, and then a woman. This is a sore subject for her when someone comments about Tylor`s obvious attraction to her looks, pointing out that she has never used her appearance to get ahead; an equally sore point for her is her budding attraction to him. Yuriko is one of the most rational and level-headed officers on the http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze]. While she is senior to Yamamoto, her speciality as an intelligence officer places her outside the chain of command.</description>

He is soon promoted Lieutenant Commander and Captain of http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze]. Tylor is a irresponsible laid back captain that can always find his way out of trouble unscathed. Tylor normally allows his crew to "bend" the rules such as letting the surgeon drink while on duty. Throughout the ranks it is argued that Tylor is either the most brilliant military mind or just a lucky bafoon.</description>

<description>Kim works on the bridge as the http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze]`s communications officer. It is rumored that Kim was a fashion model prior to joining the military. She still enjoys dressing up and her urges to break out of the strict UPSF dress code cause problems between her and http://anidb.net/ch7033 [Yuriko Star]. Her hobbies include shopping and modern dance. She likes to read a women`s magazine called "Enen" in her free time, but is absolutely professional where her job is concerned.
She is cool-headed in a crisis and extremely skilled as a communications officer. She says at one point that she transfered onto the Soyokaze in order to find direction in her life, and there`s the strong possibility she did it after breaking up with a man.</description>

<description>Lieutenant Makoto Yamamoto is another very strait-laced, by-the-books military man. Yamamoto is the first officer on the http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze] and tried mightily to interject an air of professionalism to the outfit. Constantly enraged by http://anidb.net/ch7034 [Tylor]`s lack of discipline and his loose command of the troops, Yamamoto spends much of his free time in the medic`s office taking tranquilizers and making use of the neuro-cleanser. Yamamoto sees Tylor for what he is, a bumbling fool, but is torn between the unwritten soldier`s code of supporting and obeying your superior officer, and telling the UPSF brass what is REALLY going on. He is always on the lookout for a chance to get some form of command, hoping to get a ship of his own one day.</description>

While only 33 years old, Kitaguchi claims to have a 30-year drinking habit and proclaims that he performs better in surgery when he`s liquored up.
With the arrival of http://anidb.net/ch7039 [Harumi], he becomes the envy of the entire male crew. He and http://anidb.net/ch7034 [Tylor] are drinking buddies, and he is one of the few crew members to gain a deep understanding of Tylor`s true nature early on. He claims the reason he became a doctor was because "it`s better than being a patient."</description>

<description>The supremely self-confident pilot of the Ranpu-class fighter assigned to the http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze]. Known alternately as "The Samurai of Space" and "The Shoot-Down King," Kojirou graduated with honors from flight training. While he hasn`t logged that many hours of flight time, he shows deadly skill against the Raalgon forces.
Possessing an actual phobia of women, he seems to regard the Hanner sisters as a special case, no doubt owing to their own natural piloting skill. He keeps a small mascot doll the twins made for him in the cockpit of his fighter. He also gets along very poorly with the Marines.</description>

<description>Ru Baraba Dom is the commander of the Raalgon cruiser Doroume, 66th Detached Fleet. As the war progresses, http://anidb.net/ch7032 [Azalyn] comes to trust his intelligent advice. Unlike many of his fellow colleagues, Dom respects and admires http://anidb.net/ch7034 [Tylor] for his fighting and tactical abilities. Both Tylor and Dom recognize that wars can only be won when no one fights.
He is loyal to the young empress and stands firmly in Lonawer`s camp to find a way to end the war honorably and with a minimum of bloodshed.</description>

<description>Chief Advisor to the Holy Raalgon Empress, Wang craves to be more than just the Premier. He places the blame of the Emperor`s death on the UPSF and craftily convinces Empress http://anidb.net/ch7032 [Azalyn] to declare war with them.

Hungry for the power of the throne, he makes several attempts on Azalyn`s life.</description>

<description>Captain of the large destroyer Galguran, Shia Has carries approximately the same rank as http://anidb.net/ch7044 [Ru Baraba Dom], but is under his direct command as part of his fleet. She is more aggressive and forceful than Dom. She is harshly critical of the http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze]`s crew and falls to see http://anidb.net/ch7034 [Tylor] in the same light as Dom.</description>
