<name>kodomo</name>
<description>In the context of manga and associated media, the word kodomo refers to a children`s audience roughly for the ages 12 and younger. In Japanese, the word means simply "child", and has no anime/manga-related connotations at all. It does not comprise a style or a genre per se, but rather indicates the publisher`s intended target demographic.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>Golbat</name>
<gender>dimorphic</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Golbat are a larger, stronger, and more developed form that Zubat take on when they gain enough experience. In the main Pokemon game series, a Golbat is acquired when a Zubat grows past experience level 22 and is evolved into a Golbat. Golbat are found in some cave areas.
Golbat is a fierce, nocturnal Pokémon, residing in the darkness of caves, and is most active in the pitch black of night, especially if the moon is in its new phase. It is widely known and despised for its feeding behavior: Sucking fresh blood from living things in large quantities. Once it has found a living target, it attacks in a stealthy manner, often striking without warning from behind, to harshly bite down on its prey with its four sharp fangs strong enough to puncture the hide of any animal-like Pokemon, however strong the hide might be. It then proceeds to drink ten ounces of blood instantly. Golbat enjoys blood so much that it does not want to stop, even though a lot of blood will weigh it down enough so that, if it is able to even fly afterwards, it flies clumsily.
Surprisingly, after each attack and feeding sequence, Golbat`s own blood type changes into that of its victim. Once it strikes, it will not stop draining energy from the victim even if it gets too heavy to fly. Like Zubat, the female`s fangs are smaller than the male`s.</description>

<description>Gastly (Spirit in the Beta versions of the English language versions of Pokémon Red and Blue) is made of a very thin, gas-like substance, which grants it certain powers and weaknesses. Some say it is an other-dimensional lifeform, while others believe it is formed from toxic gas. It can sneak into any place if it so wishes thanks to the invasive properties of gas molecules. It can render itself nearly invisible and approach enemies undetected, and can envelop said enemies regardless of their size and induce sleepiness, slow poisoning through the skin, or even suffocation.
On the other hand, Gastly`s negligible weight and gaseous nature make it very easy for it to be blown off or even scattered to nothingness under a strong wind (although it is presumed the molecules can regroup later). A Gastly will not appear in windy weather if it can help it, but when it finds itself threatened by a strong wind, it clusters in groups under the eaves of houses to protect itself.</description>

<description>Haunter (Spectre in the beta versions of Red/Blue) takes the shape of an angular floating face with disembodied hands. It has a sinister look, complete with fangs and claws. However, when approached by people, it has a habit of reverting to a spherical form that obscures its eyes, mouth, and hands. Haunter is considered in the Pokédex to be a `gas type` Pokémon, because of the overall structure of his body. Because of its ability to slip through block walls, Haunter is said to be from another dimension. They seem to eat by first paralyzing their opponent with Lick, then draining a bit of their life force, although it`s possible they may eat other food as well, such things like Pokéblocks. It is also said to eat people`s dreams by going inside them and scaring them to death. It is the lightest of all discovered pokemon.</description>

<description>Gengar is a dual-type Ghost/Poison Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Haunter when traded. It is the final form of Gastly. It can Mega Evolve into Mega Gengar using the Gengarite. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Gengar is a dark purple, bipedal Pokémon with a roundish body. It has red eyes, a wide mouth that is usually curled into a sinister grin, and pointed ears. On its back are numerous spikes and it has smaller spikes on top of its head similar to tufty fur. Its arms and legs are short with three digits on both its hands and feet. It also has a stubby tail.
Gengar has the ability to hide perfectly in the shadow of any object, granting it exceptional stealth. However, Gengar`s body acts as a heat sink. Its presence cools the temperature of the surrounding area by nearly 10°F (5°C), because it absorbs the warmth. The anime has shown that Gengar can fly and possess people and other Pokémon. In the past, Night Shade was its signature move.
Gengar is very mischievous, and at times, malicious. It enjoys playing practical jokes and casting curses, such as pretending to be one`s shadow, then behaving erratically. When the quarry notices, the Gengar takes delight in its victim`s terror. However, Gengar has been known to be loyal to a Trainer who treats it well. Being the result of an evolution via trading, Gengar is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in caves and dark places where shadows form. It is especially fond of urban areas such as cities and back alleys, but only during the night.
As Mega Gengar, a portion of its body sinks into the ground and its arms and tail lengthen. The lower portions turn a more reddish purple, and a third eye appears on its forehead. This new unblinking eye is oval, yellow, and allows it to see into other dimensions. The spikes on Mega Gengar`s back are more numerous and pointed and additional spikes appear on its hands and tail. Its ears are now considerably longer and tilt backward.
Mega Gengar has the ability to access other dimensions and has a vicious nature. Mega Gengar has no itnerests in opponents unless perceived as prey. Its relationships are warped due to Mega Evolution. It now desires to take the life and curse anyone or anything in its path It may even curse its own Trainer. Mega Gengar sinks into an another dimension to wait for a chance to attack.
As Gigantamax Genger, it becomes larger with portions of its body sinking into ground. Only the head, tail, and arms remain. Also it changes to from a dark purple to lighter purple. The eyes change to the color white with yellow sclera. The inside of the mouth changes to resemble a tunnel with a long purple tounge sticking out. Three red clouds surrounds the top of Gengar’s head.
There’s a rumor where Gigantamax Gengar’s mouth does not lead into its body. Due the cursed energy, it’s believed to instead lead into the afterlife. By laying a trap, it hope to steal the lives of those it captures. Should someone stand near its mouth, they can hear the voices of their loved ones calling out to them.
Gigantamax Gengar is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Terror.</description>

<description>Cubone`s name is a combination of the words cub and bone, in reference to its young age and relation to bones, both as weapons and armor. The "Cu-" may also be derived from cute, as Cubone is rather referred to as cute and lonely, or the derogatory term "cue ball", referring to a bald person, which is a reference to the skull it wears. Its Japanese name is most likely a pun on 空 kara (emptiness), 殻 kara (shell), and/or からから karakara (dried-up). In the Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow a Cubone is adopted by Mr. Fuji after its mother is killed by Team Rocket. Cubone is also a playable character in Pokémon Red Rescue Team and Pokémon Blue Rescue Team. The skull a Cubone wears on its head is said to be the skull of its mother, who dies whenever a Cubone is born. Because it never removes its skull helmet, no one has ever seen a Cubone`s actual face. Its cries for its mother are often heard echoing inside the skull.</description>

Lickitung are known for their appetite as well as their extremely large tongue. A Lickitung can wrap an object or enemy with its tongue with ease and can swallow them it whole. Its tongue can also be used to paralyze its opponent.
In the Anime Team Rocket`s Jessie owned one until it was accidentally traded for her Wobbufet. Lickitung are the featured Pokémon of the Pokémon Stadium Mini Game Sushi Go-Round.</description>

<description>Koffing is a Poison Type Pokémon that evolved into Weezing. Koffing is a spelling variant of coughing, one of the reactions experienced when in proximity of Koffing`s noxious gases. The Japanese name uses the English loanword "gas" (which is used by Japanese to refer to both gasoline and the state of matter), with the prefix "do" meaning "bad" or "poisonous". Koffing are often found near abandoned buildings (burned out preferred), Caves and Volcanic rich environments. Koffing spew gases from their crater like ridges that cover their body. Koffing have a Cyclops like Skull and Cross Bones symbol on their chest and stomach. The Skull has three teeth detailed on it. Koffing have two small fangs protruding from the top of its mouth. Koffing often have a jolly or spaced out expression on their face while looking up. James from Team Rocket used a Koffing until it evolved into a Weezing. In Pokémon Snap, Koffings can be seen following Jigglypuffs around causing Jigglypuff discomfort. Koffing is also one of the Pokémon signs as well as a star constellation in the game.</description>

<description>Ditto has the form of an amorphous blob with a simplistic face. Ditto is purple and is able to rearrange its cellular structure into anything at will, but it usually changes into another Pokémon nearby. It takes on the exact form of the Pokémon and can use all of its abilities. The only things that can make it change back are being defeated and the Ditto laughing. During the night, it transforms into a rock to avoid being attacked. If it tries to transform from memory, or if it is inexperienced, it will likely mess up on certain details such as leaving its own face or staying its own size. The only other Pokémon capable of transforming is the legendary Pokémon Mew.
In the games, with the exception of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, it takes on the type and attacks of its opponent, but each attack has 5 PP. However in a battle between two dittos when it transforms its pp is reset to 5. Being its only move this forms an continual loop. It can also breed with any Pokémon that is capable of breeding, including genderless Pokémon such as Staryu or Porygon. In the anime, two Ditto are owned by Duplica, a girl who can easily imitate people. The first Ditto is used to help her run a theater. At first it cannot correctly transform its face, but with the help of Team Rocket, it overcomes that barrier. The second Ditto, "Mini-Dit", cannot change its size at all.
In Mystery Dungeon Red and Blue Rescue Team, when Ditto transforms it cannot copy any of the transformed Pokémon moves. Therefore it has only 2 attack choices -- use the attack unique to Mystery Dungeon, or use Struggle.</description>

<description>Misdreavus is a moderately-sized, corporeal apparition that somewhat resembles the disembodied head of a human female. It lacks a nose, has thick, flowing "hair", and large, yellow eyes with red irises. It appears to wear a necklace of red pearls. Misdreavus lives deep in dark caves. It projects frightening screeching and wailing noises, as well as creepy, sobbing cries, at enemy Pokemon it encounters in the caves, so as to build up a level of fright strong enough so that the Pokemon will flee. Misdreavus` pearl necklace apparently serves as its means for feeding by absorbing the fearful feelings of targets for nutrition.
In the event that a human, trepid or otherwise, enters a cave area inhabited by a Misdreavus, the Pokemon will attempt to drive him or her out by biting and pulling at the intruding human`s hair, which is used for defense.</description>

<description>Sableye lives in deep underground caves, where it leads a quiet life. It is a lithovore, meaning that its diet consists of rocks and minerals, which it uncovers from the ground using its sharp claws. When its body becomes saturated with substances derived from the rocks it eats, those substances crystallize and rise to the surface of its body, giving it a gem-studded appearance. Despite its hermetic lifestyle, Sableye is a cause of fear for many thanks to its eyes, which glitter eerily in the darkness of the caves it inhabits. In the Pokémon world, it is thought that a Sableye can steal a person`s spirit when its eyes shine that way. There is no attack type that is super effective on it, making it the first Pokémon without a weakness and the only such Pokémon until Spiritomb arrived in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.</description>

<description>Shuppet are nocturnal entities that feed on feelings of envy, vengeance, malice, and other negative emotions. They are able to capture negative feelings in the atmosphere by channeling them into its horn. The captured energy is used by Shuppet as sustenance, allowing it to grow. At the same time, the projected person feels much better as his negative emotions leave him. These Pokemon are therefore attracted to people who hold negative emotions, and are known to roam cities in the night in search of such grudges. If someone develops especially strong feelings of vengeance, Shuppet can group in a swarm to line up beneath the eaves of that person`s home.</description>

<description>Banette are said to come from plush toys that were thrown away, similar to how Grimer and Koffing are formed by industrial waste. Shuppet possesses a discarded doll, growing into and forming Banette. It is also said that Banette live in garbage dumps or back alleys and wander around looking for the children that disposed of them. Each Banette is filled with strong feelings of hate, which it expresses by laying powerful curses. It gains power to cast those curses by sticking pins into its own body, turning itself into a voodoo doll. Banette`s weakness lies in that its vital force is artificial, since it is an inanimate object infused with a cursed energy. This energy can be removed and effectively exorcized by forcing its zipper-like mouth open.</description>

Dusclops also possesses the gift of hypnosis; it can control other conscious beings. It sways the victim into hypnosis by waving its hands and gazing into the victim`s eyes.</description>

<description>Bonsly is a small pot-like creature resembling a bonsai tree. The creature was introduced in 2004 in an issue of Coro Coro Magazine. Bonsly makes its proper and most playable debut in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, the game it was first advertised as being involved in.
Despite its tree-like appearance, Bonsly is actually made of rock. Bonsly often shed tears, though it has been found out that those are "fake tears", and that it is adjusting its body fluid level (appropriately enough, it can learn the move Fake Tears, which sharply decreases its target`s Special Defense) Wild Bonsly exist only in the Pearl Version, and upon learning how to Mimic, they evolve into the familiar Sudowoodo.
Its first anime appearance is in the eighth Pokémon movie, Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. However, its name is mispronounced in that movie; Bonsly is to be pronounced similarly to "bonsai", half of its namesake, the other being sly, for shedding "crocodile tears" Bonsly also appears in the "From Cradle to Save" episode, where Brock obtains it. Brock`s Bonsly eventually evolved into Sudowoodo.
Although regarded as a 4th generation Pokémon, it was included in the 2005 game Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, where the player must rescue one from the wreckage of S.S. Libra and reunite it with its trainer, a small girl. It also appears as a statue in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon as a reward.</description>

<description>Meowth is a very unique Pokémon as it has many of the characteristics of a human. It walks on two feet, talks and is as smart as any human. Meowth is currently a member of Team Rocket and he travels around with Jessie and James trying to capture Pikachu and other rare Pokémon for Giovanni.
Meowth generally finishes his sentences with "Nyaa (ニャー)" which is the equivalent of "meow" in English. This helps people remember that despite his ability to talk like a human, he still has cat character traits.
Meowth is also known for coming up with his many schemes to try to capture Pikachu. While Jessie and James always agree with Meowth and think his plans are brilliant, they are generally foiled by Ash and his friends.
Long Con to Access Raimon City Pokémon Center
Meowth schemed with Jessie, James and Doctor Zager to figure out a way for them to infiltrate the Raimon City Pokémon Center where high-leveled Pokémon are stored in a vault that is protected by a security machine scan system that would only open if Nurse Joy (Isshu) or Nurse Joy`s Audino were scanned. Meowth pretended to be no longer part of Team Rocket making up a story that his made an error while executing a certain operation and when headquarters hear of his mistake, they told him he was fired.
Ash, Iris and Cilan believed him and allowed Meowth to travel with him. Pikachu though didn`t trust Meowth even though Meowth proved on numerous occasion that it should be trusted. Meowth`s plan was put into action when they arrived at the Raimon City Pokémon Center and as soon as Nurse Joy`s Audino was scanned to open the door, Meowth turned on Pikachu and the other and captured all the Pokémon in the vault. The long con had been a success and Meowth met up with Jessie and James below the Pokémon Center. Unfortunately, they weren`t able to get away as Ash and his friends realized that Meowth had just been conning them and they were able to stop Team Rocket.</description>

<description>The Beginning
On the morning that Ash was to start his Pokémon journey, he woke up late and by the time he reached Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory, all of the beginner Pokémon were already taken. However, Professor Samual Oak did have one Pokémon left, a wild Pikachu. At first, Pikachu did not like Ash and would refuse to enter his PokéBall. He would often laugh at Ash`s failures and refused to listen to him. However, after Ash proved his loyalty to Pikachu by protecting him from a flock of Spearow, and thus began to earn Pikachu`s trust and respect. The two have since become best friends and Pikachu never leaves Ash`s side.
Since the day Team Rocket first encountered Pikachu, it has been their sole goal to capture it. Day after day, their plan to capture Pikachu has been thwarted mainly due to Pikachu`s amazingly powerful Thunderbolt that keeps on blasting them off.
On numerous occasions, Pikachu has made it evident that he is happy being a Pikachu and has no desire to evolve into a more powerful Raichu. It has proven time and time again that it is a powerful and worthy opponent to any Pokémon that dares to battle it.
Gym Battle against Burgh`s Leavanny
Pikachu was then sent out to battle Burgh`s Leavanny. Burgh`s Leavanny managed to tie up Pikachu with String Shot but unlike Ash`s Swadloon who was able to break free, Pikachu ended up getting hit with a couple of Leaf Storm attacks and a Hyper Beam before it rolled into another of Burgh`s Leavanny`s Leaf Storm attacks to break the string off its body so it could attack. Freed from the String Shot, Burgh`s Leavanny tried to tie it up again but Pikachu managed to avoid it with its speed and then knocked Burgh`s Leavanny out with a combination of Iron Tail and Electro Ball.

Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy and was then matched up with Pikachu. Pikachu made quick work of Elesa`s Emolga and knocked it out with one attack, its Iron Tail.
Elesa`s Tynamo was the last Pokémon that she used in her gym battle against Ash. It was matched up against Pikachu who had just defeated her Emonga. Pikachu had a hard time defending against the fast Tackle attack that Elesa`s Tynamo kept hitting it with but Pikachu used its Thunderbolt to create a large dust cloud leaving only a small corridor for Pikachu to focus on it and so Elesa`s Tynamo couldn`t maneuver out of the way. Pikachu one hit K.O`d Elesa`s Tynamo with a Iron Tail. The loss gave Ash the overall victory.
Battle against Alder`s Bouffalant
Ash challenged Alder to a battle and he accepted though he had been walking all night and was actually quite tired. Alder sent out his Buffron to battle Pikachu but just as the battle started, Alder fell asleep standing up and didn`t give any orders to his Buffron. Alder`s Bouffalant stood still as Pikachu began hitting it with attack after attack until it Alder`s Bouffalant finally got mad at Alder and charged at him and set him flying into a tree. After that, Alder`s Bouffalant no longer wished to battle and Alder conceded the battle.
Gym Battle against Skyla
In Skyla air battle simulation, Ash`s Tranquill was matched up against Skyla`s Unfezant and since her Pokémon was the highest evolved form, she determined that her Pokémon would be the winner in that match-up. In the actual gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was up against Skyla`s Unfezant which was the match-up just after Ash`s Tranquill had defeated Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla`s Unfezant proved to be stronger and faster than Ash`s Tranquill, so Ash recalled it and set out Pikachu. Pikachu had a definite advantage over Skyla`s Unfezant with its electric attacks and it quickly knocked it out with its Electro Ball attack.
Ash Just after Pikachu ended up knocking out Skyla`s Unfezant, Skyla`s Swanna was sent out to battle against it. Skyla had been watching her grandpa`s battle videos and noticed that he used the move Aqua Ring to defend against Electric attacks. She used that same defense against Pikachu which nullified its Electric attacks. It`s Iron Tail also couldn`t hit it so high in the air. Ash then noticed the rings in the air and Pikachu jumped up on them and managed to hit Skyla`s Swanna but not directly. Pikachu was now up in the air though and Skyla`s Swanna had the advantage there and it quickly knocked Pikachu out with a powerful Brave Bird attack.
Battle Against Trip`s Serperior at the Isshu League
Pikachu participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where it is was matched up against Trip`s Serperior. Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter its speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round.</description>

<description>While Wobbuffet is technically Jessie`s Pokémon, it has been around so long that it has become a main character, appearing in almost every episode of the series since it debut.
Wobbuffet was first seen walking around with Benny, his previous trainer. Jessie traded her Lickitung for Wobbuffet and it has been with her ever since that day.
Wobbuffet rarely battles but when he does, his Counter and Mirror Coat moves have proved to be very effective. Unfortunately, Jessie`s tactics aren`t always sufficient to master Wobbuffet`s superior defensive skills.
Wobbuffet also randomly comes out of his Pokeball, especially during the Team Rocket motto. He is also seen blasting off with Jessie regardless if he was actually part of the action.</description>
