<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="785227">Mahou Tsukai no Yome rejuvinates fantasy in anime and brings its viewers into a mystical land filled with mysteries. You may question about certain things and you may even be confused of where the story is going. However, none of that matters because it feels good to experience the world through the ignorant eyes of the protagonist.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="625307">a very good Love Story where the couple clumsily handles each other. Characters evolve slow but steady. 
magical emergencies are handled in colourful yet calm Action Scenes. the Music perfectly conveys the wonder and sorrow. and detailed animation brings everything to life.

P.S.: chronologically the OVA is between episode 9 and 10. but since that is mostly a flashback into Chises childhood, you might want to watch it beforehand.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="77536">it will make you cry like a *****.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="136401">A great and beautifull story. 
It is a completely "must see".</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="117590">So far seen only first half but I`m hooked, It reminds me a tiny bit of Aria series which is my all time favorite. It has mild tempo but its deep and explorative. Even action scenes dont feel threatening. Animation is excellent and so is music and voice acting.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="317942">Wow! This was spectacular. The story is fast moving yet lazily paced never letting you feel lost. The characters are lovable and believable each with their own lives to live and their own problems and stories. The main plot is beautifully interwoven between episode of everyday life with each episode driving the story gently forward. This is a masterpiece and it is going on my shelf right next to the other beautiful shows that must be seen. This is one show you should not miss</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="225406">A work of art in and of itself.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on a shounen manga by http://anidb.net/cr45199 [Yamazaki Kore].
With her mother dead and father long gone, http://anidb.net/ch80778 [Hatori Chise] has spent her childhood being passed unwanted from relative to relative, until she finally makes her unfortunate way to a strange and improbable auction block. Offered as a sleigh beggy to the highest bidder, Chise is purchased by the (literally) boneheaded http://anidb.net/ch80775 [Elias Ainsworth], who promises to take her on as his apprentice. Elias is a mage, and his world is one of dragons and faeries - but before Chise can begin to get accustomed to all that nonsense, Elias drops another bombshell. Apparently Chise isn`t just intended to be his apprentice - she will also be his bride.

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<name>magic circles</name>
<description>A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised.
Traditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for non-magical work such as meditation.
Generally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names.

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>henshin</name>
<description>Japanese for "transformation" (metamorphosis or disguise).
A "henshin anime" is any anime, where the characters or their costumes transform, such as Sailor Moon. The henshin switches on the character`s special powers, and is frequently accompanied by a costume change. Often the change of clothing is the only outward indicator that the character has changed and yet nobody seems to notice the hero`s true self.
Most henshin heroes have a special item which they use to change into their heroic form. These items are usually activated by a command phrase (which is often in Engrish, for some reason), triggering a transformation sequence.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

<name>in medias res</name>
<description>In medias res, also medias in res (Latin for "into the midst of affairs (lit. into mid-affairs)"), refers to a literary and artistic technique where the narrative starts in the middle of the story instead of from its beginning. It is generally a plot-driven concept rather than a character-driven one; though characters are commonly used to provide the backstory. The characters, setting, and conflict are often introduced through a series of flashbacks or through characters relating past events to each other.
Probably originating from an oral tradition, the technique is a convention of epic poetry, one of the earliest and most prominent examples in Western literature being Homer`s Odyssey and Iliad. Virgil`s Aeneid began the tradition in literature of imitating Homer, continued in Torquato Tasso`s Jerusalem Delivered, John Milton`s Paradise Lost and "Inferno" from Dante`s Divine Comedy. George Lucas`s Star Wars saga was told using in medias res.</description>

A common portrayal is that which is conjured by an individual that has been caused great suffering and thereby extracts revenge against the accuser in the form of a curse. This abuser will then have their soul spirited away to hell to suffer endlessly for the rest of eternity.

More so than the power of friendship, the power of true love gives boundless strength and resolution; by the power of love every hardship can be overcome, every issue can be resolved and it does make people resistant to food poisoning (caused by the bad cooking of their loved ones). Even the big bad evil doesn`t stand a chance against the power of true love and often ends up redeemed.

<name>season</name>
<description>A season is a division of the year, marked by changes in weather, ecology, and hours of daylight. Seasons result from the yearly orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth`s rotational axis relative to the plane of the orbit. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth`s surface, variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.
During May, June, and July, the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun. The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December, January, and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere.
In temperate and subpolar regions, four calendar-based seasons (with their adjectives) are generally recognized: spring (vernal), summer (estival), autumn (autumnal), fall and winter (hibernal). Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring (prevernal) and late summer (serotinal) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four.

<description>Elias Ainsworth is a magus, http://anidb.net/ch80778 [Chise]`s master and fiancée. He`s a being with both fae and human elements, and his origins are still a mystery. Known as the Thorn Sorcerer, the other faeries see him as an abomination, something he doesn`t mind. He`s also known as "Pilum Murialis" among wizards.
He can control and also turn himself into shadows, and when angry enough, he takes on a more monstrous form. He can even change his head to a human`s using magic. Despite claiming to lack human emotions, after some time caring for Chise he has slowly developed a true fondness for her. However, his innate lack of understanding certain human emotions makes Lindenbaum call him a child.
He dislikes children, saying they don`t have magic powers, but they are talented in being able to see the true nature of things.

<description>Ruth is http://anidb.net/ch80778 [Chise]`s familiar, a black grim who was originally a church guard dog who chased away grave robbers and evil spirits. He thinks of himself as a human, thus able to maintain human form.
Ruth`s original name was Ulysse given to him by his owner (who he also thought was his sister), Isabelle. Isabelle was killed by an oncoming carriage. At the funeral, Ruth believed she would awake and stayed by her grave waiting until he died.
He became a black grim, a fae who chased grave robbers away, however he continued believing he was human up until his meeting with Chise.
As Chise`s familiar, he shares a mental link with her, being able to see into her dreams and read her mind. They are still separate entities.

<description>Hatori Chise is the apprentice and future bride to http://anidb.net/ch80775 [Elias Ainsworth]. Her father abandoned the family when she was young, taking her little brother with him, and eventually her mother committed suicide in front of her. Feeling unwanted by her relatives, she sold herself into slavery so that she didn`t have to worry about anything.
She is also a Slay Vega, a special magus who can draw magic from her surroundings and within herself, at the cost of dying young because of the strain in her body, hence why Elias took her in, hoping to prevent her death. She has about 3 years left to live naturally at most.

She has known http://anidb.net/ch80775 [Elias] since she was a child, though not as his apprentice. During magic training, there was an accident causing gems to merge with her flesh.

She has formed a familiar bond with a Vodanoi-type of water fairy, http://anidb.net/ch84228 [Hugo]. She also has other neighbors in her shop, suggesting she has the assistance of more than just Hugo.

<description>Ashen Eye is a very old Faerie. Underneath the shroud, he has 3 eyes, with spiraling pupils.
Ashen Eye has a perplexing relationship with humans, taking interest in the fleeting nature of a human life in comparison to a Neighbor`s. He cherishes the moment a child becomes an adult, but also takes pleasure out of seeing a human shaken to the core of their soul.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Shannon is a changeling, who looks like a young human woman, albeit her elfish ears. She stands tall, and has fair skin, long, light grey hair, worn loose and purple eyes. She wears glasses on her eyes and small golden hoop earrings on her ears, her clothes consist of a medical coat with trousers. As a changeling, Shannon has the ability to shapeshift into the form of any human or faery.
Shannon is shown to be intelligent, hardworking, loyal and very caring, she takes her career very seriously, saying that her patients are her first priority and that she would do anything to save a person in her care, even if they didn`t want to live. She is a faerie that was placed in the crib of a human child who in turn was taken by fairies, thus making her a changeling. She was raised by humans and grew up to become a doctor. Sometime later, she returned to the Anthill after http://anidb.net/ch93342 [Shanahan], the human child she switched place with, found him and they later married one another.
http://anidb.net/ch80778 [Chise], after being knocked out into unconsciousness, is taken to the Faery world by http://anidb.net/ch80775 [Elias], for treatment and is put into a hospital bed and under the care of Shannon. Shannon bandages Chise`s eyes and wounds and puts a charm on her wrist to control her magic levels. After Chise awakens, Shannon introduces herself to Chise, tells her where she is and tells Chise her medical diagnosis. Then Shannon takes Chise, riding an ant, to a lake that heals wounds, she carries her into the water, to begin the healing process. Suddenly she throws Chise under the water and puts her hands around her neck, presumably trying to drown her and summons the form of http://anidb.net/ch92035 [Chise`s mother]. Chise overcomes this and pushes Shannon off of her, in desire to stay alive. Shannon explains, that she only pretended to attempt to drown her, to see Chise`s desire to live, and that her desire to live was clearly strong, by her actions. Shannon then explains that Chise her wounds didn`t heal at first, because of this. Chise`s wounds are then healed by the water.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Shanahan is a former human, now faerie, living in the faerie world. He`s married to http://anidb.net/ch93339 [Shannon].
Once a human, after living for many years in the faerie world, his body has transformed into a hybrid form between that of a human and a Canis. His human half is slim and effeminate and has pointed ears. Shanahan has long hair with fringes, two braids just behind his hair. He wears arm warmers, a simple, sleeveless clothing with a belt over the chest. While his animal half is unknown in terms of which type of canine it is, however, it closely resembles the appearance of a wolf with his dense and fluffy fur and a long tail. Shanahan is seen to be very cheerful and playful. He likes to cling to his wife whenever he sees her.
Shanahan was born a human child. However, he was swapped with Shannon, a faerie, while still a baby. He was raised in the faerie world, where his body eventually adjusted to the place and transformed into a faerie with the appearance akin to that of a human and animal.

Tory has a great interest in magic, particularly the natural magic produced by a mage as he finds it beautiful. His obsession bleeds over to the actual practitioners, wishing that he could have met http://anidb.net/ch91215 [Cartaphilus] and excitedly grabbing http://anidb.net/ch80778 [Chise]`s face upon meeting her as she`s a Sleigh Beggy.

<description>Winter Goddess is one of the old gods of Winter and Death. She comes off as a stoic and serious being while being presented in a regal presence, yet her demeanor changes somewhat when she takes notice of a branch from an oak mistletoe. As she takes ahold of it, her mood becomes much happier.
The Winter Goddess is first mentioned just before the night of Yule, an important cycle of the year that showcases the shift between the winter and the coming spring, by the Heralds of Yule and later by http://anidb.net/ch80775 [Elias].
