<description>Dooly is a baby dinosaur that was kidnapped by aliens, who experimented with him in order to learn more about Earth at the time, and they left him with superpowers. When he was returned to Earth, it entered the Ice Age. Separated from his family, he got trapped in ice, which caused him to spend the entire Ice Age frozen, but alive. About 10 million years later, the glacier that was keeping him sealed up broke off, and he drifted until ending up in Seoul.
While in Seoul, he was found by a girl called Younghee, who mistook him for a plush doll and took him home. She tried to show Dooly to her brother, Chulsoo, and her father, Gildong; however, surprise awaits the family, as Dooly, who has now finished defrosting and is awake, greets them...
