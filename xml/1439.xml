<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="396751">Master Keaton is an episodic anime following our main character, Keaton, on his assignments as an Insurrance Investigator. So what`s good about it?

The music and backgrounds are very nice and the main character is well felshed out. The animation is average and the artwork is ok.

There`s nothing really bad about it, except nothing ever happens. If you go into this expecting a plot, your going to be dissapointed. 

Each episode is self contained and could be watched in any order. Very few characters return from one episode to the other and they bring little to the story. There are even episode that could have worked without the main character.

Overall, it`s not a bad time waster but it doesn`t really stand out.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="354131">If you like episodic stories featuring crime/history/slice-of-life, adult lead characters, views of 20th century Europe and appreciate anime of clean presentation, then this is the show for you.

Recommended for fans of mature protagonists and episodic anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="266621">A probably underrated but nonetheless flawless work from master Urasawa (monster, 20th century boys), master keaton comprises of a big collection of true-realistic short stories, taking place in different parts of the world in today`s era or earliest decades. 
All in all a perfect blend of realistic settings and situations, with nice slice of life elements, some mystery, subtlety, smart storytelling and a variety of tales including heartwarming, tragic, survival or even war/history ones, as well as crime-detective story themes, with an intellectual modest main char, who also has flaws as a human being, but cares for and enjoys life to the fullest, while trying to experience even more things. The art style is amazing at times, including great respect to nature elements and detailed environments. It`s Celtic quality music is just the tip of the iceberg of this rare gem that few have watched.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="297941">This is nothing but a chain of good stories with interesting characters. Lots of cultural and historical influences. Never gets boring. And Keaton (the main character) could even be considered the Japanese McGuyver from time to time...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="481279">Master Keaton is another masterpiece of anime done by the master himself, Urasawa Naoki.
Although this anime is episodic, the storytelling offered in each episode is nonetheless potent and at times moving. The artwork, animation style, and voice acting all contribute to Urasawa`s "short stories" of Keaton in subtle yet meaningful ways. I must give special praise to the English voice cast that worked on this, some of the best I`ve seen in quality and consistency, especially with an episodic series like this one! Definitely designed for a mature audience--not ones that can just handle gory or sexual scenes, but ones that have been "around the block" more than a few times. If you haven`t watched this hidden jewel of anime, I dare you to, you will not be disappointed!</recommendation>

<description>A bounty hunter is one who hunts and captures targets (be it people, animals, etc.) for monetary gain, preferably without killing/destroying their target. Despite being illegal in most of the world today, it is a legal profession in the United States and Philippines (a former commonwealth of the US), who are known as "bail enforcement agents".

<name>detective</name>
<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>A mafia is a type of organized crime syndicate whose primary activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions. Secondary activities may be practiced such as gambling, drug trafficking, loan sharking, and fraud. The term was originally applied to the Sicilian mafia, but has since expanded to encompass other organizations of similar methods and purpose, such as in "the Russian mafia" or "the Japanese mafia", and is applied informally by the press and public, but the criminal organizations themselves have their own terms; for example, the original Sicilian and Italian-American mafia call themselves "cosa nostra", while the Japanese mafia calls itself "yakuza".

Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown.

<description>The Special Squads are called in when the police is completely outclassed, e.g. fighting criminal syndicates. These special forces are trained to combat specific forms of crime, e.g. the anti-cyber-crime division.
There are several such squads: Whereas Section 9 of Ghost in the Shell is an official government organisation, there are also "benevolent" vigilante groups like the Knight Sabers (Bubblegum Crisis).
Criminal syndicates also have their special forces e.g. "death squads".</description>

These anime are not "story-less" but story is secondary to character development and the characters themselves and what they experience.</description>

<description>Archaeology is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture. The archaeological record consists of artifacts, architecture, biofacts and cultural landscapes.

<description>The anime is derived or draws elements from the Greek mythology, and as such features some mythological characteristics of Ancient Greece. Those may be creatures, such as the Centaur or Hydra, tales, such as that of the Trojan War, or even the Gods themselves, like Zeus or Poseidon. More subtle references also count, such as the careful usage of names of places or people that hold significance in the myths.</description>

<description>Terrorism is, in the broadest sense, the use of intentionally indiscriminate violence as a means to create terror among masses of people; or fear to achieve a religious or political aim. It is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence during peacetime or in war against non-combatants (mostly civilians and neutral military personnel). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Hiraga-Keaton Taichi is the son of Japanese zoologist Hiraga Taihei and well-born Englishwoman Patricia Keaton. Keaton`s parents separated when he was five, and young Taichi moved back to England with his mother. As an adult, he studied archeology at Oxford University, in part under the tutelage of Professor Yuri Scott.
At Oxford, Keaton met and later married his wife, who was a mathematics student at Somerville College. The couple later divorced, with Keaton leaving his five-year-old daughter Yuriko in her mother`s care. After leaving Oxford, Keaton joined the British SAS, reaching the rank of master sergeant and seeing combat in the Falklands War and as one of the members of the Iranian Embassy incident. His combat training serves him in good stead as an insurance investigator for the prestigious Lloyd`s of London where he is known for his abilities and his unorthodox methods of investigation.
In addition to his work for Lloyd`s, Keaton and his friend Daniel O`Connell operate their own insurance investigation agency headquartered in London. Even though Keaton is fairly successful as an insurance investigator, his dream is to continue his archaeological research into the possible origins of an ancient European civilization in the Danube River basin.</description>
