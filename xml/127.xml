<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="590008">This anime came from the television in Finland when I was child, so this show makes me kinda nostalgic about. Very good for those who love mecha and character relations a`la Clamp. Also if you like fantasy adventures, magics and beast summonings, you might want to watch this.</recommendation>

<name>sword</name>
<description>A sword is a long, edged piece of metal, used as a cutting, thrusting, and clubbing weapon in many civilizations throughout the world. Before firearms became commonplace, and fast enough to render other weapons pointless in the battlefield, they were the main kind of weapon for war and duels alike. A sword fundamentally consists of a blade and a hilt, typically with one or two edges for striking and cutting, and a point for thrusting. That aside, however, they may come in all sorts of designs: the medieval European swords used to be big, heavy weapons that did not actually cut but instead broke the enemy`s bones under their armor; conversely, the Chinese jian sword (called "ken" in Japanese) attempted to exploit the armor`s joints and perforate the enemy`s flesh in those places, but was useless against the armor itself, and did not take the strikes, preferring to redirect them, to this day being considered a highly "circular" weapon and associated to taijiquan; on the other hand, the Japanese katana was a balanced all-purposes weapon that could be used even in an axe-like way, but which a master swordsman could use in many other, more elaborate manners.</description>

<description>Magical girls (also known both in Japan and in the West as mahou shoujo, and in Japan as majokko) are young girls with superhuman abilities of magical nature. In the early years, magical girls usually used magic to solve everyday problems and often transformed into idols; nowadays, however, the term is most often used to refer to with girls who fight evil using magical powers, and, although transformations are still common, they tend to be more along the lines of a change of costume.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>parallel world</name>
<description>A parallel world, parallel universe, or alternative reality is a self-contained separate reality coexisting with our own. Because "alternative reality" sometimes implies that the reality is a variant of our own, like for example a mirror world, we use the term "parallel world/universe" which is more general, without any connotations implying a relationship (or lack thereof) with our own world/universe (meaning a fictional world can just as well have an alternative reality, it doesn`t need to be our reality). To put it more simply, this category is to show if more than 1 world/universe/reality is present in the anime.
Multiple timelines of the same world/universe/reality are NOT considered parallel worlds. For example, in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate] the cast travels through multiple "World Lines", which are defined as parallel timelines of the same universe had various events occurred with differing outcomes.</description>

Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>isekai</name>
<description>An isekai story is one in which the lead characters are transferred to and become stuck or trapped in another world, one completely different from the one they lived in up until the transfer. The new world is commonly a http://anidb.net/t2628 [fictional world], such as a http://anidb.net/t2838 [parallel world] or http://anidb.net/t2839 [virtual world] (other fictional world types can also apply). What defines the isekai genre is that the characters are sent to another world, often but not always a parallel one, and they generally cannot come back permanently without meeting a highly specific goal.
In order to adapt to their new environment, they must use the abilities and knowledge brought from their former world as well as any that may have been bestowed upon them by their brave new world. In some cases, they will seek and eventually find a way to return; in others, they will gleefully embrace their new life.
http://anidb.net/a144 [Inuyasha] is an example where isekai applies to a fictional world that is not also a parallel or virtual world. http://anidb.net/ch7246 [Higurashi Kagome] climbs down an ancient well at her grandfather`s shrine and is transported to feudal Japan (time travel). While she eventually gains the physical ability to travel back and forth between her time period and feudal Japan, her bonds and responsibilities to feudal Japan tie her there until they are ultimately resolved.
For clarity, below is an illustrative example where isekai is applied to a non-fictional, non-parallel, non-virtual world.

* The main characters are from Earth. One day, they are abducted by Nazis from Mars (alternate "world") are brought back to their Martian base. The main characters are trapped on Mars. Their only escape is to defeat the Nazis and steal their spaceship to return to Earth (specific goal required to escape); they are left to thier own devices, with no prospect of help from Earth, and no way to contact Earth.

The main feature of the franchise is having a story that crosses over several popular mecha anime, manga and video games, allowing characters and mecha from different titles to team up or battle one another. Due to the nature of crossover games and licensing involved, only a few games have been released outside Japan, and in English; early English-language games only feature Banpresto`s original characters and mecha, and a flagship installment were to never be released until 2016, with the English release of Super Robot Wars V in Southeast Asian countries.

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Fuu is a very demure but very intelligent young girl (though this goes more for book-smarts than street-smarts) who hails from a prep school and is generally the voice of reason.
Always very polite and considerate, she frequently speaks formally, even to Hikaru and Umi, though she sometimes has her comic moments (occasional weird quips and her tendency to chat with Umi on off-topic matters). Still, she is a valuable friend and trusted ally.
Fuu adapts relatively easily to Cephiro, seeing it much like a role-playing game (a favorite pastime of hers). She is part of an archery club, so she shows skill with her initial weapon: a bow and arrow. But interestingly, Fuu`s Magic Sword turns out to be a huge broadsword that is taller than she is. Fortunately, its magic powers also make it light enough for her to wield.
Fuu is the second to revive her Guardian, and she has fallen in love with the mysterious swordsman Ferio.
She is the Magic Knight of Wind and her name translates to "Wind of the Phoenix Temple".</description>

She is quick-tempered and at first uncaring and selfish, though perhaps the best-suited for the task at hand, but is also the most reluctant. As Magic Knight Rayearth progresses, she starts to care for other people and better understand the Magic Knights` situation. Perhaps this is because she is a "privileged" girl.
Interestingly enough Umi is the first Magic Knight to revive her Guardian.
She is the Magic Knight of Water and her name translates to "Sea Dragon Blossom".</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Hikaru is pretty much what you expect in an anime redhead: fire in her eyes, energetic and assertive almost to the point of aggressiveness. She`s a girl of action.
She`s also a girl of emotional extremes. She`s normally upbeat and happy all the time. Having a dog back home, she takes to the cute Mokona instantly. She is however vulnerable to bouts of deep depression, especially when something really shakes her to the core. She also looks a little young for her age and is a bit naive.
Hikaru is the most willing of the three (at first) to become a Magic Knight, and Hikaru`s magic sword is the most traditional, resembling a broadsword.
Her family runs a kendo dojo, so she`s the quickest to get into the swing of things.
Interestingly, though, she`s the last to revive her Guardian (Rayearth).
She is the Magic Knight of Fire and her name translates to "Light of the Lion Shrine".</description>

It is revealed that she was once a noblewoman of Cephiro, and had later used her power as the Pillar to prevent her younger brother Ferio from being punished for stealing something from her. He had forgotten she was his sister because, at his own request, she had used her magic to help him forget about her so he would not miss her or feel sorrow, and asked that she in turn forget him, so that she could focus her thoughts and prayers only on Cephiro.</description>

<name>Lantis</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Lantis is a powerful Kailu and the younger brother of High Priest Zagato. He makes his first appearance in episode 23 of the second season, his reasons for coming back to Cephiro after the destruction of the Pillar shrouded in mystery. In the beginning it is only revealed that Lantis is a traveler, having seen many worlds during his self-imposed exile from Cephiro, one of the most important, and last, being Autozam - one of the three invading countries. For this reason, he is regarded with suspicion by the people of Cephiro.
Brief flashbacks during the show, reveal to us that Lantis was Princess Emeraude`s Captain of the Guards before Lafarga. The time period is blurry, as Lantis himself tells Hikaru. With the added knowledge that in Cephiro those with strong hearts can live for extended periods of time, changing their appearances at leisure, his age can vary from several decades to several centuries. At the most 700 years, since Clef admits (at the beginning of the manga) that he himself is 745 years.
Lantis is a quiet and private man but undeniably strong, in heart, body and mind. Such is clearly hinted at by both Master Mage Clef (who believes that Lantis has enough power to equal that of his older brother Zagato and perhaps even surpass it) and Debonair (who makes no secret of the fact that his heart is `fearfully strong` and that she wants him for his power, going as far as to send Nova to get him for herself).
Lantis is a powerful mage - having learned from Clef, his former master - and wields a sword skillfully enough to be considered a talented swordsman. This makes him the only Magic Swordsman in all of Cephiro.
During the second season, he falls in love with Hikaru and she with him; together they face the possibility of imminent destruction of Cephiro - who still lacks a pillar and is slowly crumbling - and surpass the obstacles set out in front of them: Nova, Debonair and the three invading countries.
He shares a deep friendship with Eagle of Autozam - leader of one of the major three invading forces - and doesn`t wish to fight him for the sake of the pillar`s crown. It is later revealed that Lantis`s return to Cephiro was conditioned by his desire to stop the tragedy of Emeraude and Zagato from ever repeating again; his greatest wish is to destroy the Pillar system and he is willing to give his life to achieve his goal.</description>

When Hikaru and Lantis start to become friendly with each other, she pops up to stop them out of jealousy, but Mokona either chases her away or eats her and later spits her out. She can use low-level healing magic when necessary.
Primera makes an appearance in Tsubasa in the Hanshin Republic and is later mentioned in the country of Piffle, by Shogo Asagi. Rather than being tiny, she is the size of a normal human.</description>

She makes her appearance throughout the anime`s second season, corresponding with Presea`s presence in the manga.
Sierra is pretending to be Presea to take away some pain of the Magic Knights, who blame themselves for not being able to help Presea, and of Ascot, who blames himself for killing Presea.
Clef falsely tells the Magic Knights that Princess Emeraude made a wish to revive all the people who died while she was imprisoned, but in fact, no one can revive a life once it is lost.
Sierra is in love with Clef, as was Presea.
She cannot make weapons out of Escudo, but she can help revive the weapons once they are lost; She did this to help Hikaru regain her sword after Nova broke it.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>When he is first introduced, he is seen as a terrible villain who has kidnapped the beloved Princess Emeraude, watching cruelly as Cephiro crumbles without its pillar. However, this image is far from the truth.
High Priest to Princess Emeraude and Clef`s right-hand man, Zagato fell deeply in love with the beautiful and kind Princess. Despite her best efforts to put Cephiro first and foremost, Princess Emeraude fell in love with Zagato as well. When Emeraude goes missing, Zagato came forth as having had kidnapped Princess Emeraude. In reality, Emeraude was so upset by her lack of will that she imprisoned herself in the water dungeon to avoid seeing Zagato. Zagato does not reveal this to the Magic Knights or Cephiro`s people, aiming to destroy the knights when they come after him.
The reason Zagato is this way is because of his deep love for Emeraude and equally deep hate for Cephiro`s Pillar System. The Pillar must devote every moment of their existence to praying for Cephiro and never seek happiness from anything except seeing the planet prosper. Zagato was tormented to see Emeraude chained down as such and even more so when she had to resist the love that had grown between them. He decides that instead of Emeraude returning as the Pillar and continuing to be a slave to Cephiro, he would rather have Cephiro cease to exist.
In the end of the first season, he is killed in battle by the Magic Knights in a final attempt to protect Emeraude; his last words tell her to "be free." His death caused Emeraude to become lost in her own grief and rage, causing her to be killed by the Magic Knights, who were only forced to.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Alcyone is an ice sorceress who tutored under Clef and was brought up to attend to the Pillar.
However, she fell in love with the high priest, Zagato, and for this love became his servant, although the affection is entirely one-sided.
In the manga, she is killed after failing Zagato not once but twice. In the anime, she lives on until near the end of the second series; few after Zagato and Esmeraude`s deaths, she`s captured by the evil witch Debonair, who brainwashes her into becoming her slave.
Lantis captures Alcyone in battle, but she has lost her memories; when she recovers them, she reveals Debonair`s plans for Cephiro and Debonair`s location, but her former mistress kills her before she can finish.</description>

<name>Ascot</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Ascot is a Palu, a young child with the unusual ability to summon monsters, whom he considers to be his friends.
Although hideous, they have no ill will, but villagers still fear them. Thus, Ascot was driven away until Zagato offered to give him and his friends a home in exchange for serving under him.
In the anime, he destroys Presea`s house with his monsters, and essentially causes her death; later, he confronts the Knights again (their first encounter in the manga), but Umi slaps him for using his friends and causing them pain. This causes a change of heart in Ascot, and he then forsakes Zagato.
In the second series, he has used the power of his own will to make himself into an adult because of his love for Umi. Also, he still summons monsters but has learned other spells from Clef to avoid using his friends as living weapons.
In the anime he is able to tell Umi his feelings before she leaves to fight Tarta. Umi replies that she loves him as well, but just as much as everyone else in Cephiro, and that she didn`t have any romantic feelings for him. This saddens Ascot a bit, but he still tries to win her heart later on.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Caldina is a dancer who speaks with an Osaka accent (which is translated as a deep Southern accent in the English dub, due to the translations including words like "y`all"), wears extremely skimpy clothing, and has an endless passion for money (several notable similarities to Naga from Slayers).
Zagato hires her as an assassin after his other minions fail; in addition to her dancing skills, she is an accomplished illusionist and hypnotist.
In the anime she has great affection for Ascot, whom she treats as a naive younger brother, and she joins him in deserting Zagato.
It is revealed in the second manga series that she is native to Chizeta.
It`s also been shown that Caldina is incredibly good at cards and other games of chance. Romantically, Caldina becomes involved with Lafarga in both versions of the series.
Caldina also appears in Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE- as a bartender.</description>

<description>Lafarga is the Captain of the Guard and charged with protecting the Pillar.
Although Cephiro is mostly peaceful, he kept himself busy slaying the occasional monsters that would appear.
In his takeover of the country, Zagato hypnotized him into trying to kill the Magic Knights as a last-ditch effort to stop them before they challenged him personally, but the girls managed to bring him to his senses.
In the second part of the story, he is romantically involved with Caldina.</description>

<description>Inouva is an anime-and-game-only character sporting an elven appearance and manner.
He was a devoted servant of Zagato`s--in fact, a birthday present from Emeraude to her High Priest.
Inouva is not humanoid as he appears, but an animal-shaped elemental of lightning who assumed a human form to better serve his new master. His true form resembles a giant dog with two tendrils streaming from its head.
His weak spot proved to be the gemstone embedded in his forehead in either form.
He first challenged the Magic Knights in the Sky Shrine, and would have defeated them if not for Windam`s revival. He later resumed his true form, and was destroyed by Hikaru.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Eagle Vision is a well-known and respected commander from Cephiro`s neighbouring country, Autozam, a technologically advanced world reliant on the mental energy of its citizens for its power.
It is clear right away that Eagle is an enigmatic and forceful tactician, and though a gentle and chivalrous gentleman, he is the leader of Autozam`s invasion of Cephiro. His father is the President of Autozam.
Eagle comes to Cephiro with hopes of duplicating the Pillar System back on his home world, and also wishes to actually become the Pillar for personal reasons. Eagle is in fact very sick and wasn`t even supposed to be alive by the time he made it to Cephiro. Eagle reveals to Hikaru that he wants to become the Pillar to spare Lantis` life and be in an eternal sleep with Cephiro.
In the end, Hikaru tells him it is unfair of him to leave all his loved ones behind and saves him, bringing him back to Cephiro and starting him on the road to restoring his health. In the anime, however, Eagle sacrifices himself in order to save the Magic Knights.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Mokona is a mischievous, nonsensical rabbit-like creature, with a striking similarity to a manju bun, with a red gem in his forehead above his eyes. From this gem he can produce a tent for the Magic Knights to sleep in, food, and other necessary supplies. Unlike the nearly identical Mokona Modoki/Soel from xxxHOLIC and Tsubasa Chronicle, he is unable to speak, and is limited to making `puu` sounds, however Fuu is somehow able to understand him.
This Mokona is quite distinct from Soel, even though they have nearly identical appearance. The dimension witch Yuuko hints that her Mokonas, Soel and Larg, were based on this original creature from Cephiro.
Mokona is named after Mokona, one of CLAMP`s artists.</description>
