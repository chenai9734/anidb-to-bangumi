http://anidb.net/ch8032 [Perrine] travels across Europe with her http://anidb.net/ch8033 [mother], a photographer, in a cabin lead by a donkey. They are heading to a small village in north France, the home of Perrine`s dead http://anidb.net/ch75930 [father]. Perrine doesn`t know that they are unwanted in the village, since the father left the village after having quarrelled with his http://anidb.net/ch8035 [father], and married in India against his father`s will.
After her mother falls ill, Perrine has to sell everything, including her beloved donkey Palikare, to pay for medicine. Mother dies in Paris, and before dying tells the girl that she has to make her grandfather love her before he knows who she really is.
