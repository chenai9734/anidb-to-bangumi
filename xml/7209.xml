<description>Note: Development of this project was put on hold after the director and original creator, http://anidb.net/cr54 [Kon Satoshi], passed away in the 24th of August, 2010, right in the midst of production. On the 11th of November, 2010, http://anidb.net/cr731 [Madhouse] announced that production had resumed, with the character designer, http://anidb.net/cr11195 [Itazu Yoshimi], taking over as the acting director. At Otakon 2011, however, the movie`s producer, http://anidb.net/cr2380 [Maruyama Masao], revealed that production had been put on hold for financial reasons; at that point, he had also stated that he was dedicated to eventually be able to finish the film and that about 600 shots out of 1500 had been animated so far. On the 9th of August, 2013, Maruyama claimed at Otakon 2013 to be still striving to finish the project, despite the apparent inactivity.</description>

<name>stand-alone movie</name>
<description>You can watch this movie without having to watch something else first. This tag should not used for sequels, side stories, or summary movies, but may be used if the movie is either the first anime in a franchise or a remake.
The movie must be feature-length. For shorts, use the `short movie` tag. In general, a "show-in-show" would not qualify as standalone. For example, an anime has a cartoon show within it. If the show within was released as an OVA or movie, it would not be considered standalone.</description>

<name>development hell</name>
<description>Due to unforeseen circumstances, the production or release of this anime has been pushed back, stalled, or cancelled one or more times from when it was first announced.
While some of them have eventually been completed, others might have only had a trailer released or have been changed into another format (e.g. a TV series turned into an OVA).
Common reasons for a work to become stuck in development hell include creative differences, legal issues, financial problems, scheduling conflicts or the death of an involved creator.</description>
