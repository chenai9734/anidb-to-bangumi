<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="131821">Grate anime reminds me why I love animes so much :D
Its a bit different of what one would expect but its a good comedy.
My personal only complain is it had the stupidest last episodes possible. 
Namely episode 10.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="194065">A typical harem with typical patterns for this genre and with a plot about unusual abilities of students. However, the plot itself was done well, so this is suitable for fans of this genre. The rest is not more than 7 from 10 points.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="335160">Better than average harem/romcom with a good story and pacing, and a satisfying ending. :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="111668">Surprisingly good. A few eps felt a bit bland but the rest had a decent story and a good amount of romcom. Switch the boring eps with more background story and we got a winner.</recommendation>

<name>horny nosebleed</name>
<description>In Japanese media, healthy young men who have no other sexual outlet will often suffer nosebleeds upon seeing the naked female body, or even just a pair of well-filled panties.
The nosebleed is, of course, a visual shorthand/euphemism for sexual arousal. It is commonly interpreted that way for males and females, with little trickles of blood indicating mild arousal, and gushing fountains of blood indicating erection/extreme arousal in both sexes. It can also be interpreted as shorthand strictly for erections in males. In that case, when blood shoots from the nose explosively, and in ridiculous quantity, the implication would be an ejaculation.

<description>The character suffers from some kind of amnesia (memory disturbance or loss). This may mean inability to memorize new information, or inability to recollect old memories. Since there are many types of memory, the person may e.g. forget who they are but still retain learned skills.
Amnesia is fairly common in fiction as a plot device. In fact, because it allows for major plot changes while requiring little creativity from the author, it may be subject to heavy overuse.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<description>Even though school clubs in Japan are not mandatory, there is some pressure from the social grid (e.g. fellow students, teachers) to participate in some kind of after-school activity, be it in sports or arts. Colleges also have clubs.
As a comedy element in anime, some students have joined too many clubs, and are thus constantly stressed out. There is also the element of social commentary, making it clear that you have to join a club, if you want to be part of the class. Since self-founded clubs need at least 3 members, the desperate search and advertising for new members can be cause for hilarity in anime.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>violent retribution for accidental infringement</name>
<description>A comedy / slapstick element often found in Ecchi anime: The hilarity derives from spontaneous embarrassment, overreaction of the "victim" (girl), immediate retribution for a seemingly inappropriate act, and a sense of pity with the supposed "aggressor" (boy).
Typically a boy will - through no fault of his own - stumble into a girl, thus invading her personal space. In the process the boy may e.g. pull down her skirt, grab the girl`s breasts, or accidentally kiss her. Any level-headed girl would see the accident just for what it is. Not so the girl with an overly developed sense of modesty, and a thing for violence. She - often a tsundere - will clobber the boy with excessive brutality.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometers, about 30% of Earth`s total land area and 8.7% of the Earth`s total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school.

And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<description>Two or more characters swap bodies (or, equally, swap minds).
When this plot is done, usually the voices also switch as narrative cheat to help viewers keep track of who`s who. More subtly, it`s just the eyes. More serious/action-oriented shows might not do this. The Flip often involves characters of different ages, genders, races, or social classes. Another variation is a protagonist and antagonist switching, which usually involves each trying to undermine the other`s organization while simultaneously trying to switch back. If one or both of the characters have superpowers or other special abilities, they`ll have a lot of trouble figuring their new powers out.</description>

<description>This anime is a http://anidb.net/t2797 [new original work], and it has been adapted into a JDrama.
A JDrama (Japanese drama), also called "terebi dorama" ("television drama") or "dorama" for short, is a Japanese live action television series.
Japan produces many drama series every year, from a huge variety of genres. Like anime, they generally air in three-month seasons or multiples thereof, with new shows airing every season. Some kinds of drama, especially the morning or afternoon ones, tend to be broadcast daily, while evening ones tend to be broadcast weekly, also like anime.
In exceedingly rare instances, a specific episode of a new original work anime can also be adapted.</description>

<name>season</name>
<description>A season is a division of the year, marked by changes in weather, ecology, and hours of daylight. Seasons result from the yearly orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth`s rotational axis relative to the plane of the orbit. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth`s surface, variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.
During May, June, and July, the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun. The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December, January, and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere.
In temperate and subpolar regions, four calendar-based seasons (with their adjectives) are generally recognized: spring (vernal), summer (estival), autumn (autumnal), fall and winter (hibernal). Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring (prevernal) and late summer (serotinal) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four.

<summary>The episode opens with Yamada being scolded by the teachers for his poor grades. Shiraishi comes by delivering the class journal, and Yamada is admonished to be more serious about his studies just as she is. Later, he passes Shiraishi on the stairs, and as they glare at each other contemptuously, he trips, falling down on her. When Yamada comes to he is in the infirmary, and he finds that he is in Shiraishi`s body. Eventually he finds Shiraishi who is likewise in his body, and they agree to meet after school to try to do something to return to their own bodies. During the school day as Shiraishi, Yamada learns that the beautiful honour student`s life is not without its problems, as she`s being bullied. While he is still in her body he gets it into his mind to help stop people from bullying her. He tries to attack one of the bullies, making as if to punch her but intending to stop just short of hitting her, but Shiraishi in his body interposes himself and gets punched instead. This is enough, however, to make the bullies believe Shiraishi is no longer to be trifled with. They attempt to return to their bodies by falling down the stairs as before, but this doesn`t work, but eventually they figure out that the body swap is effected by a kiss. They attempt to use this strange power to their advantage, but one of the student council vice presidents, Miyamura, figures out what they are up to. It turns out they can swap bodies with anyone, and he provides them with access to the former Supernatural Studies club room. A girl appears in the club room, asking if the club has been reformed and requesting to join.</summary>

<summary>It is the school trip, and Yamada and Shiraishi swap bodies for most of it, so she can continue studying, leaving Yamada to deal with the business of socialising with the girls. Eventually he convinces her to swap back, and Odagiri Nene, Miyamura`s main rival to becoming the next student council president, attempts to blackmail him with a pictures of him (actually Shiraishi in his body) rooting through Shiraishi`s underwear. She tries to get Yamada to convince Shiraishi to not attend the mock exam a couple of days later. He tries to use the body swap power on Odagiri in an attempt to delete the incriminating photos but finds that the power does not work on her. After kissing both Itou and Miyamura to test, he finds that he is no longer able to swap bodies. After they get back from the school trip, he finds that Itou and Miyamura have fallen in love with him. It seems that he lost the power to swap bodies and instead charms people whom he kisses. Kissing Itou and Miyamura cancels this power again. They realise that the change happened right after he kissed Odagiri.</summary>

<summary>Itou attempts to make the Supernatural Research Club into a real club of sorts, requesting funding from the student council. The student council president Yamazaki is unimpressed by Yamada`s threats, nor charmed by him when he comes to see him in Shiraishi`s body. Inexplicably, however, he sees through the ruse, realising he is still talking to Yamada, but offers them a deal to provide the club with funding. He tells them how Shiraishi, despite her excellent performance in school, refuses to enter college after graduating. He wants to know why and to convince her to do so, as it would be a disgrace for the school for their best student not to go on to higher education.
One day, Yamada swaps bodies with Shiraishi while she is very sick, giving him a chance to see her house and find out why she refuses to go to college. He realises she is a sad and lonely girl. He manages to convince her to go to college after graduating after he says he plans to go himself as well.</summary>

<summary>Itou Miyabi eventually convinces the three of them to let her join the club. She turns out to have a bit of a mania about supernatural phenomena and produces a lot of junk that are supposedly supernatural artefacts. Her presence puts a bit of a damper on Yamada and Shiraishi`s plans  to use the club room as a secret place to perform their body swapping. Eventually, however, she catches Yamada and Shiraishi kiss, and infuriated, she begins to spread rumours around the school that the two of them are dating. In an attempt to undo the damage, he tells Itou the truth about the body swap power, and performs it on her to prove it. It turns out that Itou is known for spreading tall tales and no one really believed her. It turns out that she left the school in Yamada`s body in an attempt to intimidate the punks who duped her into buying the fake supernatural artefacts, but it turns out that even in Yamada`s body she is unable to fight them off. Yamada shows up in her body and manages to beat up the punks. This earns him Itou`s gratitude, and her fascination at experiencing a true supernatural phenomenon. She has them experiment systematically with the body swap powers.</summary>

<summary>Yamada, now possessing the ability to charm people he kisses, constantly puts off kissing Shiraishi, fearful that this new power he has will affect her. He seeks out Odagiri, attempting to settle things with her, instead chasing off some of her flunkies, who seem to be under a similar influence as Itou and Miyamura had after Yamada kissed them. Odagiri however, also seems to be similarly in love with Yamada, much to the consternation of her supporters.
Eventually Shiraishi convinces Yamada to kiss her, warning her about possible consequences, but instead their bodies swap as before. They deduce that the power to swap bodies is innate to Shiraishi, just as the charm power is innate to Odagiri, and Yamada has the ability to copy the powers of those he kisses. Odagiri and Igarashi Ushio, one of her supporters, see the two of them kiss, and this devastates Odagiri who is still under his spell. Igarashi used to be one of Yamada`s friends but they had a falling out after he got Yamada suspended by covering for Odagiri, whom he is in love with.
They eventually work out a deal with Odagiri, getting her to delete the incriminating photos in exchange for undoing the charm powers. Igarashi also provides them with some of the notes of the previous Supernatural Research Club before it was disbanded, describing the existence of seven "witches" in the school, Evidently Shiraishi and Odagiri are two of the seven.</summary>

<summary>The student council has asked the Supernatural Research Club to investigate incidents of first-year students embroiled in trouble, which they believe to be caused by yet another witch, Takigawa Noa, who seems to have the power to see the past of those she kisses. Yamada has difficulty reaching her at first, but she perks up immediately when the topic of the witches comes up, which makes him very suspicious. As it seems that the powers of the witches are inherited by students who are troubled in some way, Takigawa`s plan seems to be to make her friends obtain these powers by making them similarly troubled and removing the present set of witches.
Takigawa`s group attempts to get Shiraishi expelled by using her body swap powers against her and causing trouble while in her body, but the Club is one step ahead. Takigawa`s friend winds up swapping bodies with Yamada in Shiraishi`s body, who overpowers her companions. After they negotiate with Takigawa to release her friends, Yamada confronts her and he finds her power is to see traumatic events in the past of a person she kisses. He learns that her friends were framed for the troubles they found themselves in, and were disgraced as a result. Ultimately he convinces her to stop with her plans as he promises to help them to regain their original status.</summary>

<summary>The student council has requested Yamada and Miyamura to visit a truant student named Sarushima. It turns out that she is another witch, with the ability to see the future, and stopped coming to school because she saw a vision of her causing a fire in the old school building. She kisses Yamada, who receives her powers, and they understand that the visions are from someone kissed. Yamada finds out that Sarushima earlier kissed another transfer student named Tsubaki. Yamada finds him, and learns that he has a crush on Shiraishi, and that he likes to fry tempura in the old school building whenever he is depressed. He is thus evidently the direct cause of the fire in the visions.
To prevent the fire from happening, Yamada tries to swap bodies with Tsubaki, but he resists. He returns to Tsubaki in Shiraishi`s body, bringing him out on a date in an attempt to stall for time, but before Tsubaki can confess his love, Shiraishi comes out and kisses him. This would have changed the future such that Shiraishi becomes blamed for the fire instead, but Yamada manages to stop Tsubaki from his cooking.</summary>

<summary>The Supernatural Research Club is trying to find the second volume of the notebooks left by their predecessors which describe the other witches. It is supposedly in a locked storage room kept by the teacher who is conducting the supplementary lessons, which Yamada has to take along with a few others, including a very shy and soft-spoken girl named Otsuka. Yamada swaps bodies with Shiraishi, and after his performance seems to markedly improve Otsuka kisses "him". This leads Shiraishi to suspect that Otsuka is yet another witch, so she has Otsuka kiss Yamada again when he is in his own body. Her power turns out to be telepathy, and by incorporating Miyamura into their telepathic network they manage to pass the supplementary exams and obtain the key.
They find that the storage room was cleaned out long ago and no trace of the second notebook is found. They try to figure out who had the room cleaned.</summary>

<summary>Yamada attempts to get Miyamura to help him see Shiraishi, who is trapped in Asuka`s body and is prevented from coming to school. His sister Leona asks to see him, and she asks him to tell her his story. Yamada, Odagiri, and Tamaki later meet with Saionji, who tells them the side effects of her powers: no one but Yamazaki knows about her and she has been so lonely as a result. Yamada points out that now the three of them also know about her, and if she continues helping Yamazaki it will be back to just the two of them. She agrees to help on the condition that they bring Leona to school. She agrees to go, after telling them how she was part of the original Supernatural Research Club with Yamazaki. and how Saionji removed his memories, making him forget all about her.
Yamada finally reaches Shiraishi who is in Asuka`s body and brings her to school and returns her to her own body. Leona and Yamazaki meet again, and he finds that though he doesn`t remember her, his feelings for her were not erased. They perform the ritual, and Yamada wishes that the witch powers vanish from the school, knowing how these powers have all largely brought the witches sadness.
In a private moment, Yamada finally gets to confess his love for Shiraishi, and the two of them kiss. They don`t swap bodies any more.</summary>

<summary>Yamada tries to explain to Shiraishi what was going on but she cannot accept the explanation and refuses to kiss him. The next day he runs into Odagiri who now seems to remember everything: Yamada can undo Saionji`s powers on the witches by kissing them. Saionji meets up with Yamada again, and tells him that the reason the Seventh Witch`s name is kept secret is because if one can gather all the witches together any wish can be granted by performing a special ritual.
Saionji`s powers fail to affect Odagiri a second time, so Yamazaki tries to take more drastic measures. He has the student council issue a warning about a "kissing bandit" in the school, which makes Yamada`s attempts at restoring the memories of the other witches harder. He offers Odagiri a deal, noting that she has truly fallen in love with Yamada herself, that he would make her wish come true if she hindered Yamada`s plans. She refuses, knowing that she would never be able to compel Yamada`s love that way, that he would always be looking at Shiraishi. He then sends out notices to all the witches to gather at a certain place and time: he is attempting to perform the wish-granting ritual. Yamada then has to perform the ritual himself before Yamazaki.
Tamaki and Odagiri try to find Saionji and convince her to help, but she refuses, and hints that Yamazaki may be planning to perform the ceremony to eliminate Yamada altogether. Despite Yamazaki`s efforts Yamada is able to get to Ootsuka, Sarushima, and Takigawa. He tries to reach Shiraishi and finds that Yamazaki has gotten to her first, and it is Asuka Mikoto in her body.</summary>

<summary>Tamaki has been using his invisibility powers to attempt to spy on the Supernatural Research Club and learn what they know about the Seventh Witch, not realising that his powers don`t work on Yamada, who deceives him into believing they aren`t making any progress. Miyamura introduces the club to his sister, Leona, who dropped out of school, terrified of the Seventh Witch`s powers to make people forget everything about the witches.
Yamada later meets the Seventh Witch, Saionji Rika, whose powers seem not to require a kiss. He seems unaffected, and still seems to remember everything. He returns to the Supernatural Research Club and is shocked to find that Saionji`s powers have instead affected everyone else, and because they knew him only from their work with the witches, they have all, including Shiraishi, forgotten about him. He teams up with Tamaki, who seems to be the only other person in school who seems to remember anything.
Tamaki suggests a plan that requires Odagiri`s charm powers, so Yamada convinces her to kiss him. As they do this, Shiraishi sees them, and she bursts into tears without understanding why.</summary>

<summary>It is the school festival, and the Supernatural Research Club uses Sarushima`s powers to make a fortune-telling booth. Sarushima tells Yamada that she doesn`t like having her powers of prognostication as she wants to fall in love, and wonders if there is a way to remove a witch`s powers. They learn of Tamaki Shinichi, who has the ability to steal a witch`s powers. He already took the power of invisibility from the witch Asuka Mikoto. He bargains with Yamada, getting him to look into the future to see who will become next student council president, as he has sights on the position himself. The student council president says that he will appoint as his successor whoever is able to identify the seventh and final witch.
Yamada kisses Sarushima again and sees a vision of the future where Tamaki becomes president after taking Sarushima`s powers and he has Shiraishi as his secretary. This vision of Shiraishi as sad and lonely as she once had been disturbs Yamada so much that he begins the hunt for the mysterious Seventh Witch in earnest. Yamada confesses to Miyamura that he has fallen in love with and doesn`t want to see her that way ever again.</summary>
