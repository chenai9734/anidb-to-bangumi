<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="504638">This one is that kind of anime you never expect to be so involving. I wasn`t expecting much when I started watching it, but it ended up being some of the best shows I`ve experienced so far. The story of a young city boy who enrolls to an agriculture school is simply funny, amazing and somehow thoughtful.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="173054">Not everyone will be into this, but this is a solid Slice of Life anime. All of the characters are great, the animation is pleasant, and anything can be awesome. This anime will constantly keep you entertained.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="509507">Dont let yourself be fooled. Just because this anime`s main topic is about livestock doesn`t mean it`s boring. I was skeptical about this anime exactly because of that reason, but to my surprise this was a great journey.
Good characters, nice character development and some pretty awesome heartwarming feel. That`s what Gin no saji is all about!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="558578">good watch for all you agricultural students/people, you can learn a thing or two from this anime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="531127">Woooooooow, it`s really awesome how an agriculture anime can be so great. Funny, educational, slice of life. Recommended!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="449787">What`s more than ordinary life? Colorful life! That`s what I see on this. Comedy, slapstick, teamwork, and daily life at school makes this activity more alive!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="813396">This is for both seasons:

To sum up this is an actual hidden gem. At first i thought it was gonna be some show about bumpkins ragging on a city-slicker but it`s a very good and very high grade coming of age story. I almost kick myself in the butt for not watching this when ever it was being aired. This easily ranks up within my personal top 20 of the anime that came out during the 2010 decade.

It`s funny, light-heart romance, and has plenty of morals to take away from it; but most of all it was a compelling and realistic story that made the plot more engaging. 

Although the second season ends off in the middle of the manga, I incur you to read the manga to finish out the story. It is done and it`s worth the closure that viewers deserve.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="547343">Just makes you feel good.
I watched this show and was like "man, life is a great thing, this is awesome."</recommendation>

<description>The young boy named http://anidb.net/ch55012 [Hachiken Yuugo] apparently aspires to live separated from his family.

Grown up as all-easy-to-get city boy, he is forced to uncover not-too-convenient truths about agricultural life. Enjoy the story of Hachiken, as he is trying to keep up with his friends, farmers` heirs who are already accustomed to hardworking farm life.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

The timeslot was expanded from half an hour to a full hour in 2010, and now airs Thursday nights from 00:45 to 1:45.
noitaminA aired its first non-anime series in 2010, with the premiere of the live-action adaptation of Moyashimon. On April 15, 2010, Fuji TV and FUNimation announced an agreement that allows FUNimation to simulcast series from the noitaminA block in North America within an hour of their airing in Japan.</description>

<description>The entire series (at least a major part of it) is centred on a particular subject. Information is fed to the audience in a sublime manner. Most of the time an on-screen written comment by the narrator (or translator) can be seen, e.g. biological specimen, medicine, process, etc. Sometimes at the end of every episode’s closing song, a 20 seconds educational clip is presented.</description>

<description>Many anime are created as part of larger projects encompassing many shows without direct relation to one another. Normally, there is a specific idea in mind: for example, the http://anidb.net/t4859 [Young Animator Training Project] aims to stimulate the on-the-job training of next-generation professionals of the anime industry, whereas the http://anidb.net/t3763 [World Masterpiece Theatre] aims to animate classical stories from all over the world.</description>

<description>Hachiken Yuugo is a city boy from Sapporo. After failing to pass the entrance exams for the high school of his preference, Yuugo decided to enroll at Yezo instead, believing that easier academic course would leave him with more time to prepare for college exams. However, the agricultural courses` demand for hard labor proved his assumptions wrong. Due to his father`s strict upbringing, he is somehow unable to refuse when someone needs his help. Despite complaining a lot when he feels people are abusing of his generosity, Yuugo quickly earns the friendship and respect of his peers. Just after enrolling, he joins the Equestrian Club along his classmate Aki, soon rising to the position of vice-president due to his reliable nature. Yuugo is usually anxious about his future as, unlike his classmates who already have set their goals in life, he is still wondering about what career he should choose.

<description>Mikage Aki is a first year who is also a member of the Equestrian Club and Yuugo`s love interest. She is studying to inherit her family business, a cow and horse farm specialising in raising Ban`ei race horses. Aki usually has a cheerful and positive attitude and she eventually develops feelings for Yuugo, leading to them start dating. Her father is very protective and was wary of her relationship with Yuugo at first, but some time later starts seeing him as a man worthy of becoming her husband, just like the rest of her family. Once her family goes into difficulties and is forced to sell all their horses, Aki, encouraged by Yuugo, expresses her will to not inherit the farm and become a professional jockey instead. Thus she starts studying to enter college with his help. Another curious trait of Aki`s is that she is so enthusiastic about horses that she can easily memorise every fact related to them, thus Yuugo makes use of it to help with her studies.

Aiming to be a great cook, he travels the country to perfect his cooking skills with questionable results, and usually drops by Yezo to pay a visit to his brother, despite Yuugo`s animosity towards him. During his travels, Shingo meets a Russian girl and ends up marrying her.
