<recommendations total="1">
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="673908">Undoubtedly the worst season. There`re way less things to be excited about, unsatisfactory, big deviation to the previous formula, etc. I remember the day I got excited every few to ten of episodes, and that day was long gone.

Still good if you`re a fan of DnA for the characters, or any other aspect other than what I mentioned.</recommendation>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A first-year second baseman of the team, Haruichi is a naturally talented, all-rounder baseball player. Despite his small stature and frail appearance, he has pinpoint precision while batting the ball, able to hit it as wide and as far as he pleases, and control where the ball lands. He also is extremely talented at defense, able to catch a ball in the air and throw it while still floating. He is often noted to have amazing baseball sense, able to decide in a split second where to hit the ball, what to watch for, and when to steal. His ability in baseball exceeds his older brother`s, Ryousuke Kominato, who is first-string player and also a second baseman. The only thing lacking is his stamina, which he works hard on improving. Born in the Kanagawa Prefecture, he is a very calm and quiet person, often acting as tsukkomi to Sawamura Eijun`s boke. He has a habit of saying things bluntly and often praises either Furuya or Eijun, causing them to compete against each other frequently. He plays reserve in the first-string team and occasionally feels envious of Eijun and Furuya for being able to play in a match. He is very small compared to other boys and it has been noted that he looks a bit like a girl. He is easily embarrassed, especially when praised. His relationship with his brother is slightly strained because they play the same position, but he still admires him to no end. Though reserved, he is highly ambitious and aims to take his brother`s position. When he was a child, their relationship was closer, with Ryousuke often protecting him from bullies.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Eijun`s rival, Furuya is a right-handed pitcher with extremely strong fastballs and forkballs. Furuya`s pitches are so strong that no catcher in Hokkaido was able to receive them. As a result, he became alienated from his middle-school team because he was far above them in ability. After hearing about the genius catcher, Miyuki Kazuya, he applied to go to Seidou high school to play baseball with him, and immediately took respect when Miyuki easily caught his pitch. During the game of first years versus second years, Furuya jumped from the second team to the first team after only one pitch. After playing his first official game against Yokohama, Furuya became a living legend within the high school baseball world and is often described as a monster rookie. Furuya`s strong points are his incredible pitching, outfield defense, and batting. His weaknesses are stamina and infield defense. Also, Furuya`s pitches are so powerful that they cause damage to his fingertips and nails, so he cannot pitch for very long. He is stoic and unsociable with a cool demeanor and often has an expressionless face. However, his aura completely changes while pitching, once being described as "a wild wolf who wants to pitch some balls". He dislikes all other aspects of baseball besides pitching. However, he is surprisingly humble, once mentioning that he never thought himself better than Eijun. He respects Eijun to a certain point and often accompanies Eijun to do extra practice at night. Because he was an outcast in his middle school, he is happy about but unused to the Seidou upperclassmen`s friendly but bossy treatment towards him, being content when he was ordered to fetch them drinks and uncomfortable when they excessively praise him. He also likes taking advice. He gets bored easily, disliking it when he cannot play in a match, and often falls asleep when he isn`t playing, or when he wants to ignore somebody.</description>

<name>Sawamura Eijun</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The main character. Eijun is a left-handed pitcher who has extremely erratic throwing motions. His body is naturally flexible with supple joints, allowing him to immediately change the pitch`s direction. Because Eijun has been playing baseball without proper instruction, his pitches normally change direction right before the batter hits the ball. However, this makes catching the ball difficult, as most catchers cannot predict where the ball will end up. He was initially unaware of this quirk in his throws. His knowledge about baseball is mediocre at best, but he strives to improve his skills and become Seidou`s ace player. Eijun comes from Nagano where he played baseball in his middle school. His team was below average, often making mistakes during critical moments and losing almost all matches. However, Eijun has an extremely strong spirit which, no matter how hopeless the situation got, inspired his teammates to continue playing their best. His childhood friend, Wakana, was the baseball team manager. Initially, after Eijun had been scouted by Seidou, he had planned to refuse because he wanted to keep playing with his friends in the same high school. However, his friends encouraged Eijun to go to Seidou despite their reluctant feelings because they felt as if they were holding Eijun back. Eijun eventually goes to Seidou and boldly declares that he will become the team ace. Eijun`s strong points are his infallible spirit, bunting, infield defense, and his idiosyncratic pitches. His weaknesses are control, outfield defense, and batting. His personality is hotheaded and loudmouthed, often causing his teammates exasperation because of his stupidity. He has a rivalry/friendship with Furuya Satoru, a fellow first-year pitcher. Because his middle school team was so weak, he is extremely level-headed in critical times.

<summary>It`s Seido`s practive game against Seiho, the beast from Aichi. Sawamura has a great first inning, striking out two batters. They`re facing Seiho`s ace Akashi, once hailed as the super rookie when he played at Koshien Stadium as a first-year. After an injury caused his form to deteriorate, he spent a year in obscurity. Now, he has returned armed with a muscular body and powerful pitches. The Sawamura-Okumura battery must cooperate to take on Seiho`s machine-gun-like batting lineup.

<summary>The tense practice game against Seiho is tied at 0. Sawamura gets into trouble in the top of the sixth inning, but an incredible throw to home by center fielder Aso pulls the team through. In the bottom of the same inning, lead-off batter Yuki’s hit arcs high. How far will it go? Meanwhile, Sawamura is feeling the weight of his responsibility to the coach and his team and continues spiraling down. His dogged determination is obvious to not only the nine fielders, or the players on the bench, but even to the fans in the stands.
