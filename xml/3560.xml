<description>The second movie is about the return match between the All Europe Soccer Team and Japan. At the beginning Hyuga denies to join the team due to his 3. defeat against Nankatsu. He practices hard with Kyra to perfect his Tiger Shot. Misaki can`t come and Wakabayashi isn`t allowed to play for he normally plays for a German team. With those lacks and Schneider`s (the European`s captain) improved skills, Tsubasa and the Japanese team have grave problems. Despite the new rules, Schneider finally want`s to beat his rival Wakabayashi with his new "illusion shot", thus he injures Wakashimazu and Murisaki (the second and third goal keeper) with brutal face shots until Wakabayashi is finally allowed to play. In the course of the match Hyuga manages to perfect his Tiger Shot and joins the team. With those legendary players united and Hyugas new power they manage to defeat their opponent 4:3 in the last minutes.

<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Wakabayashi Genzou is an extroardinary goalkeeper who can catch almost anything thrown at him. Not many shots can come past Genzou. A charismatic guy, Genzou is also loyal to his friends and he is firm with his decisions. Genzou always keeps his feelings to himself and people close to him as seen in Shin Captain Tsubasa, when he`s willingly criticize his teammates` performance in order to make them realize that football in Europe is different than what they play in Japan. His actions caused a lot of Japanese players to dislike him and Genzou only told Tsubasa his true intentions. From early childhood, he has aimed to be the best goalkeeper in the world. He tended to be selfish, and brag about his skills before he met and played a couple of games against Tsubasa. After his match against Tsubasa, he has learned to enjoy the game with his other teammates.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>To help his family, Hyuuga Kojirou wants to be a professional player, an ace striker. His devotion to football and his persistence to shoot the goal is outstanding. He was both Tsubasa`s and Genzou`s top rival. A great guy, Hyuuga is not only strong, he is also tough but at the same time caring. Can be a bit impulsive at times, though. He was once famous because of his roughness and many players were scared of him. But, Hyuuga is actually a kind boy who cares about his family and friends. In the World Youth series, Hyuuga was one of the 7 players to be excluded from the Japanese National team after they lost 3 group matches with Real Japan 7 (R.J.7). Determined to get back into the team, Hyuuga developed a new shot, the Raijuu shot, a shot which is a bit similar to Tsubasa`s Drive Shoot, except that Hyuuga`s Raijuu Shot is a ground shot that will curve upward, unlike Tsubasa`s Drive Shooter which will go up then curve downward.</description>

<name>Wakashimazu Ken</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The "Karate Keeper", Wakashimazu Ken is a goalkeeper on par with http://anidb.net/ch2084 [Wakabayashi Genzou], but more offense-oriented. As his nickname implies, he is an expert karateka since his father is the master of a dojo. His father originally disapproved his efforts to become a footballer and his opposition to become the heir of the dojo.
Wakashimazu became interested in football when http://anidb.net/ch8344 [Hyuuga Kojirou] invited him to join the Meiwa team after being impressed by his abilities in a one-on-one duel that Wakashimazu lost. Since then, they are close friends.
Despite being an excellent goalkeeper, he originally was a forward and only became goalkeeper because Meiwa didn`t have competent goalkeepers.
A reliable partner of Hyuga while in the Meiwa and Toho teams, he and Wakabayashi regularly alternate in the goalkeeper position with the Japanese team.</description>
