<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="86023">A lot of people complaining about the animation yet still demand a S3 smh honestly. So first of all, this type of animation is what we`re going to get more of as time goes by. You`re not gonna get the 90s style; the industry is changing but people are still stuck in the past.

I wish people would just be happy there IS a continuation of Berserk in the first place.

Anyway if you`re not much into mangas like me, then this is your chance to keep up with the story. My partner read the manga and she said the anime is pretty loyal. 

Might be a while until we see a continuation however as the writer is incredibly slow and has admitted to that himself. The fact of the matter remains though that Berserk is still up there.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="136978">I enjoyed this one even more than the first season.
The plot thickens, the characters keep developing...
What`s more is there to wish for? A new season, of course!</recommendation>

<name>elf</name>
<description>The origin of Elves (Norse; álfar(elves), álfr(elf)) can be found in ancient Norse mythology, in which, elves are described as divine, or near-divine, race of humanoids (Vættir), likened to the Æsir. In common description they are described as sage and immortal beings occupying the threshold between humans and the gods. In some cases humans that were beloved by the gods became elves within their lives. Ancient Elves are delineated into a pair of similar but distinct races; Light Elves (Ljósálfar) and Dark Elves (Svartálfar), each originating from separate homes within the nine worlds of Yggdrasil. Within the Poetic Edda the differences are commonly ascribed as:
"There is one place there that is called the Elf Home (Álfheimr which is the elven city). People live there that are named the light elves (Ljósálfar). But the dark elves (Dökkálfar) live below in earth, in caves and the dark forest and they are unlike them in appearance - and more unlike them in reality. The Light Elves are brighter than the sun in appearance, but the Dark Elves are blacker than pitch." (Snorri, Gylfaginning 17, Prose Edda)</description>

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence.

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>important haircut</name>
<description>When a character cuts off his or her hair, it often symbolizes a rite of passage or bout of character growth. A princess striking out on an adventure, or a new recruit at boot camp, for instance. Hair is something that takes time and effort to grow, so parting with it voluntarily can be a powerful act.
This is particularly a big deal when women get haircuts. Yet in fiction, even an accidental hair slicing can leave a character with a surprisingly even cut.
In many religions (Western Christianity, Ancient Egyptian religion, and others) priests and/or monks cut/shave their hair. Roman Catholic nuns also tend to cut and mantain their hair short under their veils when they enter the nunneries. The cutting of one`s own hair is also a part of Buddhist mythology, specifically something done by Siddhartha himself early on in his path to enlightenment, so anime examples might draw from this as an allusion. There are also some cultures, including Native American and many Asians, where a person would cut his or her hair as an act of grief, disgrace, or even rebellion. In the Confucian tradition, hair (like the rest of your body) is considered a gift from your parents and may not be damaged without a very good reason. Furthermore, prisoners and psychiatric patients commonly have their heads shaved, often to prevent the spread of lice, but sometimes also as a demeaning measure.

<name>gore</name>
<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<description>Guts is the primary protagonist of the story. He is a tall, muscular man who wields the Dragon Slayer, a zweihänder or 2 handed sword about 7` long and 12" wide at its base. Described in the manga as more of a table-sized slab of iron than a blade, the Dragon Slayer`s massive size makes it the ideal weapon for slaying apostles of the God Hand. Guts` left hand is prosthetic, a replacement for the one he lost when Griffith attempted to sacrifice him to the forces of hell; it folds back to expose a hidden cannon within the wrist. Guts also carries throwing knives, miniature bombs, a dagger, and even a repeating crossbow that can be mounted onto his prosthetic arm.</description>

Extraordinarily charismatic, intelligent, and handsome, his skill with his sabre and tactics gives him and his band the reputation of invincibility, making him the favoured choice of the Midland King, who was locked in a century long war with the Empire of Tudor. Griffith is willing to sacrifice everything for his dream of his own kingdom and believes that he is destined for things greater than the average man.</description>

<description>Zodd, also known as Nosferatu Zodd, or Zodd the Immortal, an apostle who has lived for three centuries fighting countless battles in search of worthy opponents. Zodd has the ability to transform from his human-like form into a more menacing creature, resembling that of a minotaur with the face and tail of a tiger along with a pair of bat-like wings that he can retract and grow at will.
Zodd first encountered and defeated Guts and Griffith during a castle raid, ultimately deciding to spare them upon realizing Griffith`s crimson behelit and Guts` inevitable fate.</description>

<description>The female member of the God Hand, Slan takes on the form of a naked woman with black leathery wings and vine-like hair. She is a sadomasochist who thrives on cruelty and the effect it has on those who observe it. She appears to have a fascination with Guts when she manifests in the Qlippoth to confront him and feed on his negative emotions, having as well shown an interest in his incredible strength and survivability when the Count summoned the God Hand. Her interest is probably derived from her sadomasochistic tendencies from how much Guts suffers in his journey.</description>

<description>The Skull Knight is an enigmatic figure and a self-proclaimed foe of the inhumans, having waged war against demonkind for a millennium.
An ancient being, the Skull Knight is aloof and mysterious with great understanding of the deterministic nature of the world and foreknowledge of the predestined. As such, he possesses a brutally realistic worldview, oftentimes citing the inevitability of causality`s flow. Despite this outlook, he has proven to be quite heroic, saving http://anidb.net/ch650 [Guts] and his comrades on multiple occasions. However, http://anidb.net/ch87815 [Flora] has questioned whether his actions are out of genuine care or merely a means of furthering his own agenda, a query which the Skull Knight turns a deaf ear to. He ultimately values the human will to survive and defy fate, encouraging Guts to contend against causality and aptly naming him "struggler". He is also quite insightful, warning Guts that http://anidb.net/ch654 [Casca]`s true desire might differ from the Black Swordsman`s own.
The Skull Knight has a long-spanning rivalry with Nosferatu http://anidb.net/ch2009 [Zodd], who is always excited to fight the knight, calling him "old friend". He is normally indifferent to Zodd, only showing irritation at the apostle`s efforts to impede him, though he does openly acknowledge their history and rivalry. He has also known and apparently had a close relationship with the witch Flora for at least several hundred years.

Azan is an elder man who is notorious for almost always wearing armor. He`s balding and has a thick mustache. His helmet is reminiscent of a samurai warrior`s kabuto, and his constitution is muscular, but stout. Recently, he was shown to be a bit taller than dwarves.
Since Azan follows old fashioned code of honor. when he fought Guts one on one he ordered the others to stand down. He is shown to care for his fellow knights as shown when he felt ashamed when he fainted and trapped under the rappels and was unable to save them. He is shown to help others whenever he can as when he helped http://anidb.net/ch87813 [Schierke] and her friends against the pirates without being asked.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Isidro is a young runaway thief who joins http://anidb.net/ch650 [Guts] in his travels as a member of the swordsman`s traveling party.
He has always dreamed to be, if not a soldier, the best mercenary warrior of his time. The inspiration for his ambitions is the legend of a once formidable captain - the great "Hundred Man Slayer" - who fought in the original http://anidb.net/ch2063 [Band of the Hawk]. Although Guts has never revealed to Isidro that he is in fact the young boy`s idol, he has supported his dream nonetheless. Being a younger member of the group, Isidro looks up to Guts as a father figure, despite his insistence to the contrary. Currently, he is training under Guts, hoping to achieve his dream of becoming the greatest swordsman in the world. Rather than teaching Isidro his moves, Guts instructs him to learn to fight using his own style, as each person has a different strength, speed, height, and arm-reach. Isidro develops his spinning move using a cutlass, passed down to him by Morgan, and the Salamander Dagger, given by http://anidb.net/ch87815 [Flora].
When receiving compliments individually or as part of the group Isidro and http://anidb.net/ch81095 [Puck] normally brag about how they can manage things themselves. However, both vastly exaggerate their own aptitude for combat. The two are extremely close friends and Puck often sits on the young boy`s head, seeing himself as a mentor of such to the boy. Puck attempts to teach him in the ways of the "Elf Dimension Style", to little success.

<name>Serpico</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Serpico is one of the main characters of the series. He is a servant and illegitimate son of the noble Vandimion family who would join http://anidb.net/ch650 [Guts]` Traveling Party along with his half-sister http://anidb.net/ch81096 [Farnese]. He is polite in manner, and very loyal, sincere, and protective of Farnese.
He is a slender young man with blond hair. His most notable feature is that his eyes are closed at almost all times, except for when he is very serious. He is often compared to a fox because of this. While a member of the Holy Iron Chain Knights, Serpico wore silvery-white armor around a green shirt with matching scarf and skirt. After leaving the Iron Chain Knights, Serpico wears traveler`s garbs prior to receiving the Sylph Cloak. In combat, Serpico is a deft fencer, very clever and cunning.
From his terrible life on the streets, he has grown to show very little emotion, often hiding his true feelings behind a facade of incompetence or sarcasm. He is scared of fire and dislikes the sight of blood, which makes him an unlikely warrior. He learned from growing up poor that revenge only brings more revenge, and avoids creating these situations. Farnese would sometimes force him into duels with other nobles that insulted his honor, but, though he was always far better than his opponent, he chose to purposefully end it in a draw, as he was well aware that the nobles would want revenge. Serpico views Farnese as his guardian angel for saving him from his miserable life on the streets, and does not hate her, despite that she condemned his demented mother for being a heretic (when she, quite obviously, was not), and forced him to burn her himself.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Puck is the first of the companions that http://anidb.net/ch650 [Guts] makes during the latter`s days as the Black Swordsman. He is an elf of the pisky race, descendants of the ancient spirits of wind.
As an elf, Puck is, at first glance, similar to a miniature naked human. Upon closer inspection, Puck`s features as an elf become more distinct; his ears are elongated and pointed, he has insect-like wings on his back, and he lacks any kind of visible genitals. Puck sports blue hair that grows out in all directions at the front (similar to a tomato stem) and uniformly points backward in the back. Puck`s eyes are the same color as his hair, and he has a feminine facial structure, with large eyes and a soft jawline. He often holds a burdock, the closest thing to a weapon the elf possesses.
Puck is a whimsical and lighthearted presence that stands out in the dark and unforgiving world he lives in. Not one to take people`s behavior at face value, Puck prefers to find the inherent good in those he meets rather than dismiss them for what he initially sees. As such, Puck displays a great deal of patience when dealing with less-than-reputable characters, and in some cases (like Guts`) Puck does eventually come to find that they do possess some manner of morality and a reason for their brash actions.

She suffers from an undefined infection. One several occasions she had persistent vaginal bleeding along with purulent discharge. This suggested a sexually transmitted disease; however, there was no evidence that Joachim or any of her other customers suffered from it, nor that Luca prevented her from continuing to work when she could.

His symbol is four breaking wheels, embodying his willingness to use torture as a way to "cleanse people from evil".
Mozgus is a tall, muscular and strong man with pale skin and blue eyes. His most distinguishing feature is his smooth, almost flat face that is the result of years of prostration, where he harshly kneels and slams his face into the floor. During his prayers, and whenever he is angry, his face becomes swelled with veins and he takes on a much more intimidating appearance. He wears a traditional pontiff`s garb, white with gold trimming and a red cloth that has the insignia of the Holy See. Lastly, he wears a red, wide-brimmed hat with ear covers.

Outwardly more serious and reliable than http://anidb.net/ch81095 [Puck], Ivalera often share with him moments of bickering and fighting, enhancing their value of the "comic relief" characters.

Although kind and usually friendly, she sees http://anidb.net/ch81093 [Isidro] as an incompetent monkey and regularly mocks his intelligence, causing some friction between the two which frequently lends itself to comical situations. Initially, Schierke held a disliking for Guts, however this was largely due to her not understanding him.

His torture device of choice is a man catcher, a spiked collar on a pole intended for removing a mounted soldier from his horse, and used against heretics with great efficiency.

Afterwards, she went outside and threw a burning stick into the fire. She then felt a marvelous warmth in her groin and discovered that she was a pyrophiliac. She also developed a habit of maniacally burning things that she did not like. She burned the clothes of a girl while the girl was still wearing them and also threatened to burn http://anidb.net/ch81094 [Serpico]. The only thing she burned that she was very attached to was a stuffed bunny that her father bought her during their last family trip together which he orders her to burn.
Whenever she pleased, she would whip, bite, and otherwise abuse Serpico and even drink his blood. She does not know that he is her half-brother. As a child, she treated him as a possession, and she reminded him frequently of this status. Her lack of empathy due to her poor upbringing along with the praise she received in joining in a witch burning provoked her to hunt down and burn supposed witches and pagans at the stake.

<name>Rakshas</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Rakshas is a mysterious figure exiled from the Kushan clan of the Bakiraka prior to becoming an Apostle, and presently the commander of the demon search and destroy squad of http://anidb.net/ch660 [Griffith]`s Band of the Hawk.
Rakshas` stated motivation for allying with Griffith is so he can ensure that one day he will be the one to cut off his "beautiful head". Nevertheless, he appears intimidated by Griffith. He has an arrogant and demeaning personality, belittling the http://anidb.net/ch82448 [Tapasa] for their slow reactions to his movement and marking such evidence for the Bakiraka`s fall. Rakshas` pride appears to be mostly centered on stealth, as he is never shown in battle and seems to avoid it as much as possible.
Rakshas is a hedonistic killer who plays with his victims before the kill, which is considered heresy within Bakiraka. He is also described by http://anidb.net/ch49432 [Silat], who knows him well, as relentless when chasing a target. He has a close attachment to his mask, becoming depressed enough to retreat from battle after it was broken by Silat. Rakshas seems to be a very quiet person, forming strings of words rather than sentences as he notices things, only taking the time to properly speak when addressing people directly, but his speech devolves as battles become more chaotic.

<description>Mule Wolflame is a young noble of Midland and member of the reborn Band of the Hawk. His primary responsibility is the protection of the medium Sonia. Proud, Mule believes strongly in personal honor.
Mule proves a quite strong close-combat fighter, as http://anidb.net/ch81093 [Isidro] notes during his fight with him in Vritannis. He is no stranger to warfare and has survived life in the battlefield. He is prepared to kill if necessary for http://anidb.net/ch660 [Griffith].

<name>Grunbeld</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Grunbeld, also known as the Great Flame Dragon, is an apostle who serves together with http://anidb.net/ch2009 [Zodd], http://anidb.net/ch91880 [Locus], http://anidb.net/ch91878 [Irvine] and http://anidb.net/ch91872 [Rakshas] under the reborn http://anidb.net/ch660 [Griffith] in his Band of the Hawk. He is the leader of the Hawk` giants. Before he joined the Hawks, he became famous during the One Hundred Year War, holding a small northern country alone against 3,000 enemies.
His personality is quite unusual for an apostle. Different from most of the other characters, he is a man of pride, and talks more akin to an old warrior than a sadistic demon. He is a serious man who doesn`t like jokes and fooling around. He has also shown a very honorable side, which is rare for a high-ranking member of the reborn Band of the Hawk, and even rarer for an apostle. For example, at the Mansion of the Spirit Tree he questions the orders given to him, telling http://anidb.net/ch650 [Guts] that it isn`t honorable to attack an http://anidb.net/ch87815 [old woman] with so many troops.
However, Grunbeld`s honor is debatable at best. Once he realizes how formidable Guts is while in battle against him, even facing the possibility of losing, he begins to use more craftier means of fighting and transforms into his apostle form. Guts eventually calls him out on his supposed "ethics", stating that monsters shouldn`t pretend to have such a thing as a warrior`s code or pride.

<name>Morgan</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Morgan is a native of the Enoch Village. He was kind, wise and humble, with a streak of what he admitted to be childishness that liked to chase fairies and the supernatural. He was not a confident one or one to stand up to authority, but he protested the Enochian priest`s ostracism of the party sent to help them profusely. While the group stay and try to solve the troll problem, he lingers around http://anidb.net/ch81093 [Isidro] and tries to offer good advice and assistance, often to the boy`s irritation, but Isidro eventually warms up to him.
When he was young, Morgan sought out a cure for his ailing mother, and in the woods eventually came across a http://anidb.net/ch87815 [witch] he would remember for the rest of his life who offered him her cure.
Morgan expresses amazement with the group, Isidro and http://anidb.net/ch87813 [Schierke] in particular, when they eliminate the trolls in Qliphoth and retrieve http://anidb.net/ch654 [Casca] and http://anidb.net/ch81096 [Farnese]. When the group leave, he takes Isidro aside and confesses that that day in the woods when he was a child, he was merely running from chores and other responsibilities, rather than seeking a cure for his mother, prompting Isidro to focus less on what he wishes he could do and more on what he can do, and persuades him to stop acting like a fantasy hero.

<name>Irvine</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Irvine is an apostle who serves together with http://anidb.net/ch2009 [Zodd], http://anidb.net/ch91880 [Locus], http://anidb.net/ch91874 [Grunbeld] and http://anidb.net/ch91872 [Rakshas] under the reborn http://anidb.net/ch660 [Griffith] in his Band of the Hawk as captain of the archers.
Irvine is a quiet, introverted man that primarily keeps to himself. He is committed to performing his role as a captain and is shown to take battles very seriously, carrying out orders quickly and efficiently at a moment`s notice. Aside from this, he doesn`t show much concern for other matters relating to the Band of the Hawk, preferring to distance himself from the other apostles when given leisure time. While on his own, Irvine enjoys hunting wildlife and camping in the woods whilst immersing himself in his only known pleasure: playing the lute by the campfire.
Although he is an apostle, Irvine is shown to possess a tenderhearted side to his personality that he keeps hidden. This is shown briefly while taking care of http://anidb.net/ch87814 [Sonia] and protecting her from the cold. Irvine most likely keeps this side of himself hidden due to the fact that among apostles, such traits are incredibly rare and viewed as a form of weakness.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Locus the "Moonlight Knight" is an apostle who serves together with http://anidb.net/ch2009 [Zodd], http://anidb.net/ch91874 [Grunbeld], http://anidb.net/ch91878 [Irvine] and http://anidb.net/ch91872 [Rakshas] under the reborn http://anidb.net/ch91874 [Griffith] in his Band of the Hawk as a general and captain of the lancers.
Locus generally appears incredibly calm and relaxed, shifting to a focused state-of-mind when in battle. He is calculated and strategic, being able to stay alive during his battle with Emperor Ganishka. Locus also displays a sense of wisdom that is rare among apostles, as he is able to see the advantages of capturing enemy troops and re-purposing them as a part of Griffith`s army. He also believes that every warrior is equal to each other, following the logic that just because they fight for the opposite beliefs doesn`t make that person his enemy, per se.
Until he swore loyalty to Griffith after seeing a vision of him prior, Locus was known to have been too prideful to submit to anybody. Since then, he has placed his absolute faith in Griffith, believing wholeheartedly that his leader`s actions are for the sake of the world.
