<description>A cartoon by CHUN Gye-young, which was one of the most popular cartoons in the late 1990`s, is made into an animation after 8 years of work. The film`s leading characters, with appearances typical for girls` cartoons, are already popular as various licensed products. Four musical prodigies, who never had a chance to get a music education, meet in a band called "Recycled Band". In the band, they open their minds to each other and follow their dreams in music.
