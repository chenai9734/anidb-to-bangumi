<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="31168">Unfortunately, this is one of the shows where the characters get into a heated discussion with their opponents before finishing them, thereby ruining their chance of defeating them. This to me is one of the fatal flaws of an otherwise enjoyable series. 

Another let down is that the turn of events is a bit unrealistic. Other than that, great looking heroines, and I don`t mind the pig. :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="308191">i agree with sammy on this one, I to be honest didn`t find it to my taste since the hero was just flawed in so many ways. However if you haven`t been saturated by anime yet it may be worth watching for the concept and the VR.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="433695">it`s very good anime, even animation is good, the only thing i have problem is the protagonist being a pig and in the arc in the middle which involve *imuoN* it gets really frustrated for me, but its good for those that enjoy this type of story, overall recommended :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="463248">It starts of really well. The idea is very solid but is presented quite badly. After a few episodes it starts to become dull and even feels like it`s a filler. Quite frankly, I consider over half of the episodes filler-like. They could`ve made this anime so damn awesome, but with an annoying main character and not making the main reason of Burst Link (becoming Lv. 10) the main goal of the series, this anime is fundamentally flawed and in the end extremely disappointing.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="191792">Very good anime with only 1 minus point, the main hero is a "pig". . . lol</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="185992">This series has a potentially rich and unique setting but unfortunately it fails to deliver due to many short comings. First and foremost the protagonist holds no self esteem and self confidence, he doesnt even develop as the show goes on. Second the supporting cast is quite bland. Third there is no real or compelling villain / no compelling goal or objective. This same setting/universe could have been a lot better with a well crafted plot than what was given.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="305586">Good one. It`s easy to watch (most of time), but at the same time it has some cool psychological features, and it`s up to the viewer whether to notice them or just enjoy the action.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="31156">An above average anime, definitely worth picking up. I rather liked the departure from cliche/generic pretty boy protagonist, though you will at times want him to man up.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="413731">This show was really good, but I feel that that the plot could have been better expanded and ... also made so it was not as predictable</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="558965">it`s a really nice anime..really good concepts..the animation are good, with a really nice story plot...well, even though it really looks like that this isn`t the end...
i recommend to watch this...
but, just put aside the main male character if he`s bothering you...lol</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="368156">Honestly, I was underestimating this anime before.
Just finished watching yesterday, I can say this show is great. Absolutely.

The world-system concept is one of my favorite, great animation and mecha design, plus great soundtracks. (May`n, kotoko, ALTIMA)
And of course, Kuroyukihime-sama...she`s one of my favorite girl now :3

Well, it`s a must see. I`m hoping for 2nd season   ASAP :D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="284224">Great anime and love the connection beat wean the Accel World and Sword Art Online need to watch both and a lot of things will be clear, great universe.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="385674">A great anime to watch.  A little slow at times and too fast at other times, but it is still a great anime you will enjoy.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="356572">This one actually gets even better as it progresses. Go season 2, onegai!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="269300">One of the best new comers so far! 
Really surprised me, since some dudes kept writing crazy negative recommendations for this...
But after seeing the first episode i really fell in love with it, watching it all in one go!

Oh and i got a good recommendation for people, who might believe in judging a show drastically after seeing only a few eps: Someday, you will see one anime, in which the story or setup changes completely after the 6th ep, keep watching!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="526042">I have never seen a underrated anime like that, this one is one of the best here, grade should be at least 8.5. Give a try, you will not regreat, for sure!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="532752">I start watching this anime after 4 episodes was out and it blew me away literally, it`s like nothing else u have see until now trust me in that, there is so much awesome ideas &amp; the plot is amazing it keep u glue to the screen asking for more, I check all the 20+ new anime released every season this anime become my favorite for this season in an instant, MUST SEE!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="182006">underrated !!  . a must see</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="537553">This show is a bit... unusual. It has almost every genre in it with quite the large quantity, comedy, romance, drama, action, harem, cute moe blob fest, you name it. The characters don`t fail to impress and the plot moves rather smoothly with well placed cliff hangers on every episode. It suprisinly meshes all together so well to give you a really nice and interesting show. I recommend it and would go so far to say it`s a must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="121887">Seriously underrated. It may look like a typical martial arts anime in an online game guise at the first glance, it is very definitely not. Very emotionally and intellectually engaging, and the animation is top notch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="114373">Absolutely love it. Nice storyline, good concept and character development. The event is related to Sword Art Online (SAO)

Story starts with the protagonist who is a highschool student that often bullied, weak, and tired of his loser life. Then he`s introduced with this awesome game that changed his life. With the helps of his best friends, he begin to transform from a wimp to a knight in both Virtual and real world.

Compared to SAO anime, I would prefer this one. Can`t wait for season 2.</recommendation>

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<description>Bullet time refers to a simulation of variable speed (i.e. slow motion, time-lapse, …) and is characterized both by its extreme transformation of time and space to show normally imperceptible and un-filmable events, such as flying bullets.

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<description>True for almost all anime with school setting, there will be a school excursion or field trip. Tokyo and Kyoto seem to be particularly popular as sightseeing destinations. So are hiking excursions into the local mountains. This also is a good excuse to present the prefecture`s / city`s food specialities.

Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>henshin</name>
<description>Japanese for "transformation" (metamorphosis or disguise).
A "henshin anime" is any anime, where the characters or their costumes transform, such as Sailor Moon. The henshin switches on the character`s special powers, and is frequently accompanied by a costume change. Often the change of clothing is the only outward indicator that the character has changed and yet nobody seems to notice the hero`s true self.
Most henshin heroes have a special item which they use to change into their heroic form. These items are usually activated by a command phrase (which is often in Engrish, for some reason), triggering a transformation sequence.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

The Itano circus is characterized by detailed, fluid shading of the mecha, the close-range acrobatic moves the duelling fighters make in combat, as well as twisting contrails left by fighters and missiles. It is also commonly used in specific reference to an attack where a mecha or spaceship launches a large swarm of missiles with meticulously animated spiralling smoke trails and erratic trajectories.</description>

<description>Sometimes normal just doesn`t cut it. Eating: you put food in your mouth and chew. Playing sports: you throw a ball around. You need to make it awesome, no matter how mundane it is.
Let`s throw in some gripping orchestral music, lighting changes, different camera angles, something! Don`t write like a man, write like an evil overlord! Exaggerate your expressions and gestures, speak with excessive intonation, and if all else fails, throw in some close-ups, slow motion, and ominous Latin chanting! With practice, even you can turn something like eating chips into an epic battle of light and dark, blinding the viewer with sheer awesomeness.

Although he is generally smart and careful when it comes to everyday life, Haru tends to get reckless while protecting Kuroyukihime. He views her as a mentor, friend, and lover simultaneously, which has given him the utmost respect and loyalty toward her and her army. His non-accelerated avatar is a small pink pig that was originally forced on him by his bully, only keeping it because Kuroyukihime finds it "cute." While in Akibahara, Blood Leopard gives him a different avatar to fit in, taking the form of a small pink lizard.

<description>Haru`s Brain Burst avatar, Silver Crow, has a tall, thin, fragile metallic frame that is completely devoid of weapons, forcing Haru to fight barehanded. His avatar was created by his desires to be thinner and fly away into the sky in order to escape his miserable life. The avatar possesses a mouth underneath its visor, allowing Silver Crow to eat while in the game world. Silver Crow is the first and only avatar with the ability to fly, sprouting wings on its back when its special ability is activated. Lacking in both physical strength and defensive capability, Silver Crow is dependent on Haru`s squash-honed speed and reflexes in order to survive fights. Silver Crow`s default finishing move is a basic headbutt, typically ineffective in most circumstances. Haru eventually learns how to utilize the Incarnate System to focus his willpower, gaining the ability to form energy blades from the bracers on Silver Crow`s forearms, a technique he names "Laser Sword." For a period of time, Silver Crow has the Disaster Armor Enhanced Armament and becomes the 6th Chrome Disaster. In this form, he can predict the attacks of his opponents and use all the abilities of previous Chrome Disasters. In one battle, he can partially summon the uncorrupted form of The Destiny, which is one of the Seven Arcs used to form the Chrome Disaster Armament that was created by Chrome Falcon.

<description>Her Brain Burst avatar is Black Lotus, also known as "World End," a slender robot with a feminine form which features limbs ending in sharp blades. These weapons instantly cut anything they touch due to the "Absolute Cutting Property" the avatar possesses, which has the side effect of permanently removing whatever is cut from an opponent`s avatar. However, the blades have a frail lateral portion that breaks after receiving too much damage. To compensate for this weakness, Kuroyukihime developed a technique she calls "Soft Act". Black Lotus has three special abilities: Death by Barraging, Death by Embracing, which was used on Red Rider, and Death by Piercing, a one-hit-kill direct attack; and two incarnate system skills: Vorpal Strike and Star Burst Stream. Lotus also displays an ability called Overdrive: Mode Green, which causes the purple parts of its body to turn green and increase its speed and attack power for a limited time. Lacking feet, Black Lotus hovers slightly off the ground via air jets on the legs, with which it is able to achieve incredible speeds.

<description>The main heroine and leader of the Nega Nebulus legion, her real name is unknown, although Sky Raker refers to her by the nickname "Sacchan". Her pseudonym is a Japanese word play with Snow White (Shirayukihime, 白雪姫, literally "White Snow Princess"). Beautiful and popular, she is also the Student Council Vice-President at Umesato Junior High School. She has been a Burst Linker since she was eight years old. Kuroyukihime was formerly the Black King, although she was driven into hiding after beheading the first Red King, Red Rider, while trying to defeat the other kings to reach level 10. She values Haru as more than a subordinate and is often the voice of reason to him when he is willing to go to extremes to protect her. Prior to her hospitalization, she confesses to Haru that she fell in love with him. Her non-accelerated avatar is her real-world self dressed in black and sporting red and black butterfly wings. She was apparently born on September 30, 2032 according to her forged identity in episode 9. She is estranged from her family since she injured her sister, who is also the White King, out of anger after learning that she was tricked by her.

He takes Silver Crow wings. He was doublecrossed by Lime Bell who said she would "join" him and Silver Crow had his wings returned despite her "betrayal".

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kurasaki Fuuko is a "retired" Burst Linker associated with the element of wind. She is also the vice-commander of Nega Nebulus.
Sky Raker is Ash Roller`s "parent" (the one who gave him Brain Burst) and the only person in Accel World he shows respect towards. Before Silver Crow existed she was known as "the person closest to the sky" in the Accelerated World, gaining the nicknames "Astro", "ICBM" and "Icarus". She became obsessed with the desire to fly and as a result was abandoned by her friends and "parent." Eventually, she gets the help of her only remaining friend and master Black Lotus to reach level 8. Having spent several level up bonus points trying to obtain the ability to fly, she eventually asks Black Lotus to cut off her avatar`s legs to reduce her avatar`s weight and increase her will. She is introduced to Silver Crow by Ash Roller in the Unlimited Neutral Field to help him control his willpower and use the Incarnate System to fly without his wings. After meeting her in the real world, Haru realizes she has mechanical prosthetic legs. Sky Raker later rejoins Nega Nebulus before the Hermes` Cord Vertical Race and regains her legs near the end of the race.
Her Brain Burst avatar appears as a silver-blue robot modeled after her real world self, lacking legs below the knee and confined to a wheelchair she powers through the Incarnate System. She keeps the wheelchair even after she regains her legs. Sky Raker is one of the only Brain Burst avatars that wears clothes, in her case a wide-brimmed summer hat and dress. Sky Raker owns an Enhanced Armament known as Gale Thruster, a rocket pack that, while not granting true flight, temporarily allows for incredibly long jumps and midair dashes. She lends the Gale Thruster to Haru to help him regain Silver Crow`s wings. Later on, Silver Crow shows her that the Gale Thruster is for flying in space as wings become useless without air.
