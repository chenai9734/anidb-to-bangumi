<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="1057">For what it is for the times this is pretty good, but I would only recommend this series if you`re a fan of the series as a whole. The newer Macross are much better and this has neither the plot or character development of Galactic heroes. It does however have pretty ghetto animation.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="7362">As of this writing (July `08), I recommend you don`t get your expectations up for anything other than a "classic" anime, lol.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the story, and am glad I took the time to watch it, but the animation is shocking! It`s very dated, the colours are washed out, and character/object movements are usually very jagged (surprisingly there wasn`t much scene reusing).&lt;br /&gt;Don`t get me wrong though, I`m not saying it`s bad; just very dated. At the time of making (`82-`83) I`m sure it was "good" (lol). So in order to enjoy this classic, you really need to look past the animations... And sounds... And music... And styles, etc, (lol @ "80s" hairstyles).&lt;br /&gt;But the story kept me wanting to see more, which is what you want in a good anime. There were a few dull moments, but for a series of this age, I`m surprised I enjoyed it as much as I did. Just goes to show you quality animation/sound isn`t everything.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="333955">Mecha-Jet Pilot, romance, triagle love stories... toward extiction, aliens, songs that lead to victory (very rare in any kind stories)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="616461">If you can appreciate old anime (as you should), you must give this a shot! War, love triangle, mechs, idols, aliens, etc! You`ll be impressed by how well the story develops! waaaay superior than lots of other anime we get for the genre these days!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="134143">This is the anime that started it all for me.  
Anime that have many hit songs!
The 1st waifu - Lynn MinMey!

This is the anime that got me into anime and even got the West hook on anime.  The staff are now legends.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="79832">First impression, the mecha design is revolutionary in its time. IMHO, after 20 years, the VF1 still rules as the best transformable mecha ever. Despite this, the best part is the strength of the storyline. The war plays out beautifully and sets a perfect stage for the love triangle. Character design is excellent, so is the music. The drawings may not be consistent throughout, but overall, its too good to be missed.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="460732">Unique combination of space opera, mecha, romance and music! I didn`t believe these four could work together but the result is simply awesome. And it also comes with great characters which either make you love them or hate them, but don`t leave you cold.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="82150">Watched this in 2012 and while the animation has certainly not aged well, once you get past the shock of the first episodes, you get into the plot and, more importantly, to the characters. As the genre dictates, all the good clichés are present and very few annoying ones. It did some bold things with its characters and is a tale worth seeing through.
There are epic moments and memorable ones, but it is the core message that they convey so well that sticks with you, as well do the great characters. A classic, well worthy of the title.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="114582">NO, it`s not recommendable to watch Macross Zero before this, if you made that, this series would lose its shine. Not for nothing M-Zero was made decades later. In this anime the 1st episode made a summarized narration about what happened when the alien battleship crashed, M-Zero shows you those events. Choujikuu Yousai Macross is a legendary anime loved in Japan and helped to spread that love and uniqueness of anime in the world, that`s why is a "must see".</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="108726">In one word? Impossible. &lt;br /&gt;I think ---its impossible--- to really say you love anime and youve whatched all that matters, without seing the first Macross. It gives, in my vision, the best feeling you can get out of anime, manga, whatever the form of cultural spreading there is, and that`s because this anime is all about protecting and experiencing culture, our essence, and for god`s or whatever there is out there`s sake, it does so galactically.</recommendation>

<description>In 1999, an alien ship crashes on South Atalia Island and makes the human race aware of other life in space. Ten years later, the ship is reconstructed and christened as the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross]. However, on the day of its maiden voyage, an alien race called the Zentraedi make their appearance on Earth, beginning the UN Spacy/Zentraedi war that would change the history of both races forever.

Note 1: This series spans over the time period 2009-2012, in the Macross time line.
Note 2: Robotech is the butchered US version of Macross done by Harmony Gold. It was dubbed, heavily edited and the plot was completely rewritten. The actual episode count remained, as did the rough episode structure.
Note 3: Original broadcast was incompletely animated.</description>

<description>The military, also known as the armed forces, are forces authorized and legally entitled to use deadly force so as to support the interests of the state and its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its citizens and the prosecution of war against foreign powers. The military may also have additional functions within a society, including construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding critical areas.

<name>air force</name>
<description>An air force, also known in some countries as an air army or air corps, is in the broadest sense, the national military organization that primarily conducts aerial warfare. More specifically, it is the branch of a nation`s armed services that is responsible for aerial warfare as distinct from an army, navy or other branch. Typically, air forces are responsible for gaining control of the air, carrying out strategic-bombing missions and providing support to surface forces.
The term "air force" may also refer to a tactical air force or numbered air force, which is an operational formation within a national air force. Air forces typically consist of a combination of fighters, bombers, helicopters, transport planes and other aircraft.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<description>Derived from the Biblical story of the Fall of Man: the temptation of Adam and Eve by the fallen angel Satan and their expulsion from the Garden of Eden.
This tag is used to demonstrate the unbearable loss, the feeling of losing everything along with every single bit of happiness. It prerequisites a small peaceful period of happiness. The main reason for losing "his/her paradise" can either be the death/sacrifice of an important character or even a betrayal. Usually the anime loses a lot of its former glory afterwards.</description>

<name>Itano circus</name>
<description>The Itano circus is named after Itano Ichirou, a Japanese animator, and refers to a highly stylized and acrobatic method of depicting aerial combat and dogfights in many anime, particularly the Macross series, where it was utilised by Itano for the first time and was ground-breaking.
The Itano circus is characterized by detailed, fluid shading of the mecha, the close-range acrobatic moves the duelling fighters make in combat, as well as twisting contrails left by fighters and missiles. It is also commonly used in specific reference to an attack where a mecha or spaceship launches a large swarm of missiles with meticulously animated spiralling smoke trails and erratic trajectories.</description>

<name>space opera</name>
<description>Space opera is a sub-genre of fiction that emphasizes romantic adventures in space. Space opera generally involves large-scale conflicts between opponents with powerful abilities and technology. The genre will often be melodramatic, sometimes playing music that can be nothing short of awesome. Warfare and a battle of wits are usually less emphasized, preferring romance (with exceptions, e.g. Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu). Some space operas tend to be formulaic and sometimes even prosaic, often employing very simple devices and somewhat obvious strategies. An example of this would be the infamous laws of physics in the Macross universe, in which the main male lead will hardly ever get hit in battle.</description>

<name>the power of love</name>
<description>The power of love is not only the strongest power known to mankind, it is the strongest power in the universe. The power of love conquers all things. It makes people cry, it makes people laugh, it can make them sing and occasionally it even brings dead people back to life, just so.
More so than the power of friendship, the power of true love gives boundless strength and resolution; by the power of love every hardship can be overcome, every issue can be resolved and it does make people resistant to food poisoning (caused by the bad cooking of their loved ones). Even the big bad evil doesn`t stand a chance against the power of true love and often ends up redeemed.
Even when the power of love is not literally and directly responsible, the scene is often set so that the audience is left with the impression that it was "really responsible".</description>

<description>Super Robot Wars is a series of tactical role-playing video games produced by Banpresto. The main feature of the franchise is having a story that crosses over several popular mecha anime, manga and video games, allowing characters and mecha from different titles to team up or battle one another. Due to the nature of crossover games and licensing involved, only a few games have been released outside Japan, and in English; early English-language games only feature Banpresto`s original characters and mecha, and a flagship installment were to never be released until 2016, with the English release of Super Robot Wars V in Southeast Asian countries. The franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2016.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Born in Yokohama Chinatown, Japan (though she is of partial Chinese descent) as Linn Minmei, Minmay moved in with her uncle http://anidb.net/ch21740 [Shaochin] and aunt http://anidb.net/ch21741 [Feichun] on South Ataria Island in hopes of finding the path to fulfill her dream of becoming a star. On the day of the Zentradi invasion, she meets http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] and a series of events leads to her being swept off on the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] along with the rest of the surviving population from that island. While on the space fortress, Minmay wins the Miss Macross beauty pageant and is propelled into celebrity.When the Macross returns to Earth, she is the only civilian allowed off the space fortress. After her trip home in Japan (where her parents remained), Minmay returned to the fortress with her cousin http://anidb.net/ch10513 [Lynn Kaifun] (and http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru]`s competition for her affection) in tow. Her beauty and singing talent also win over several Zentradi spies sent to explore human society, who spread their impressions among their fleetmates, thus unwittingly evoking peace-oriented attitudes among the alien aggressors. Ultimately, Minmay sings the songs that end the first war against the Zentradi.
During the second part of the series, the very fame and success she craved finally left her tired and virtually alone. She tries to run away from her celebrity status and start anew, with a more simple life alongside http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru], who is now more confused than ever in defining his feelings for Minmay and http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa]; all of this while new conflicts arise between the human and Zentradi survivors of the first war. At the end of the series both http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] and Minmay realize they are very different people, and Minmay accepts that http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] belongs with http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Misa], remaining a friend to the couple afterwards.
In 2012, she embarks on the SDF-2 Megaroad-01 colony ship, which disappears 4 years later during its voyage towards the center of the Milky Way galaxy, becoming a legend in the Macross universe since then.Source: wiki</description>

<description>Hayase Misa is of Japanese ethnicity. She was born into a Japanese family with a hundred-year military lineage and was the only daughter of Admiral http://anidb.net/ch10525 [Hayase Takashi]. Misa also had aspired to enter the military since childhood. This dream was bolstered by a desire to join her boyfriend and first love, http://anidb.net/ch10524 [Riber Fruhling], in the UN Spacy. Misa`s hope is tragically unrealized as http://anidb.net/ch10524 [Riber] dies during the destruction of the return fleet from the Salla Mars Base where he was stationed, shortly after leaving Misa on Earth.
After graduating first in her class at the UN Spacy Officers` Academy, she earned a bridge post aboard the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross]. She and fellow SDF-1 bridge officer http://anidb.net/ch10509 [Claudia LaSalle] became close friends. As Misa herself admits, her mind is constantly preoccupied with duty. This changes, however, after she meets the young pilot http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru]. Their officer/subordinate status would slowly evolve through the series, from originally a difficult professional relationship (with http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] even calling her "old lady" when he first hears her over his Valkyrie`s onboard radio, which results in his senpai, http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker], getting a good laugh, much to Misa`s chagrin) to a friendly personal one; and much later to a romantic one, clashing with the already strong infatuation http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] has with http://anidb.net/ch7418 [Lynn Minmay]. She also has some short-lived feelings for http://anidb.net/ch7418 [Minmay]`s cousin http://anidb.net/ch10513 [Kaifun], who bears a striking physical resemblance to the deceased http://anidb.net/ch10524 [Riber].
Initially ranked as First Lieutenant, she is later promoted to Captain, and later to Major, concluding with her being chosen as the commander of the new SDF-2 Megaroad-01 ship and crew.
Despite having early disputes with http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru], she slowly begins to harbor feelings for him as they share some adventures during the war, discovering both have very much in common. In the final episode, http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] realizes he is in love with Misa, and after the climactic final battle, they marry and become members of the SDF-2 Megaroad-01 crew to leave on a stellar exploration mission in 2012. Shortly thereafter, Misa and http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] have a daughter, Ichijou Miku, in 2013.
After their ship disappears in 2016 without a trace near the center of the galaxy, they were reported as missing. The whereabouts of Misa and http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] and the ship`s crew (includinghttp://anidb.net/ch7418 [ Lynn Minmay], who remained as their friend and also joined the exploration mission) are still unknown.Source: wiki</description>

<name>Roy Focker</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Roy Focker is an American who was born and lived in the United States in the late 20th century. During his college school days he had interest in prehistorical civilizations and archeology studies, and was in a relationship with his senior http://anidb.net/ch14115 [Aries Turner]. However, after being left by her, Roy dropped his studies and became a stunt pilot in the air circus led by http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru]`s father. Some time later he decided to join the U.N. Spacy after most of his friends died in the U.N. Wars. His flight instructor during this time was D.D. Ivanov.
During the war Roy became a talented and strong-willed fighter pilot, known for his love of women and alcohol. Focker was selected later as one of the first test pilots for the development of the variable fighters by the U.N. Forces. In 2008 he is deployed as a squadron commader with the Skull Team aboard the stealth carrier CVN-99 Asuka II on a secret mission in the South Pacific and flies the VF-0 Phoenix in battle against the SV-51s of the Anti-U.N. Forces. The work done on the VF-0 helps the coinciding development of the VF-1 Valkyrie.
Despite his long absence during the U.N. Wars and the death of http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru]`s father, http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] still remained a close friend to Roy and considered him his sempai (upperclassman/big brother figure). After the end of the U.N. Wars, Focker involved himself in the VF-X development project flying both the VF-X and the VF-X-1 (non-transformable and transformable flight test prototypes of the VF-1 Valkyrie), and his flight experience earned him the command of the VF-1 Skull Squadron aboard the super-large-scale semi-submersible attack aircraft carrier http://anidb.net/ch48774 [CVS-101 Prometheus].
During Space War I Roy Focker is still a smoking, drinking womanizer who constantly defies death and, when not on another desperate mission, enjoys life and its pleasures to the fullest. He has a relationship with http://anidb.net/ch10509 [Claudia LaSalle], an officer stationed on the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] bridge.Roy dies in episode 18 ("Pineapple Salad"), from wounds sustained while defending http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] from http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia Fallyna]`s force of Queadluun-Rau battle suits. Instead of going to the hospital to treat his wounds, he chooses to play the guitar while waiting for http://anidb.net/ch10509 [Claudia LaSalle] to finish her pineapple salad; while she`s cooking for him, he collapses from a sudden internal bleeding and passes away few minutes later. To http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru]`s chagrin given his then shaken self-confidence in his flying skill in war, he is promoted as the new leader of Roy`s squadron, using his mecha as well.
In http://anidb.net/a996 [The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?] 1984 film adaptation of the original TV series, the character Roy Focker dies aboard an alien Zentradi ship while fighting http://anidb.net/ch10516 [Quamzin Kravshera]. In the movie Roy sacrifices himself to let both http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru] and http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa] escape.Source: wiki</description>

<name>Maximilian Jenius</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Max Jenius was born in Europe. He is a young fighter pilot, having joined http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru]`s Vermillion Team, along with http://anidb.net/ch10508 [Kakizaki Hayao], at the age of only 16. Jenius shows in his first sortie that he is a preternaturally talented ace pilot who is near invincible in combat, despite his need to wear corrective lenses on duty. Max is quickly recognized as the top pilot of the force, as marked by being granted to distinctively repaint his mecha into his preferred blue color.
Jenius` skill at piloting mecha becomes even more celebrated with feats that no other pilot would have thought of, much less achieved. One outstanding incident involves his infiltrating a Zentradi battleship in his valkyrie and disguising it with a Zentradi uniform, allowing him to escape detection.
Jenius is not above an occasional egotistical musing when he is off duty, but he also respects his comrades and they return the favor. He is also an incurable romantic in his youth which shows when he meets his future wife. That occurred when the top Zentradi ace pilot, http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia Fallyna], hears about a formidable pilot aboard the humans` http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] space fortress and seeks to challenge him personally in battle. Max manages to defeat http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] not once, but thrice. The first in their respective mechas, the second in simulated combat (a video game) and finally in a knife fight to the death. It is this final fight where the two rivals fall in love. Immediately after the knife-fight in the park Max proposes to http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] who accepts. Afterward, http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] is allowed to join the mainline fighting forces of the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] and becomes Max`s wingmate on duty, piloting a distinctive red Valkyrie alongside Max`s blue one.
After the Zentradi Fleet that nearly destroys the Earth is vanquished, Max and http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] settle down in the new city built around the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] and begin a new life together. In March 2011, they give birth to a daughter (the first of seven) named Komilia Maria Fallyna Jenius. The name Komilia (which means "Little Milia") is chosen because with her green hair and green eyes, she looks so much like her mother (although it has also been suggested that the "ko" simply refers to the Japanese kanji character "child" that is often used on the end of Japanese female personal names - a suggestion which is supported by the title of episode 30: Viva Maria, as opposed to Viva Komilia). Komilia proves how related the Humans and Zentradi are. The "first stellar interracial child" is very unabashed baby, and proves resilient to http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia]`s sometimes rough and inexperienced handling. Max, despite his relatively young age, proves to be a happy and successful father, although he clearly has a strong dislike of Komilia`s playfulness with his hair. http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa] and http://anidb.net/ch10509 [Claudia La Salle] find Komilia adorable and are amazed that she isn`t shy at all, and envy Max and http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] for having such a beautiful child.
Max and his family play a crucial role in the U.N.` capture of a factory satellite in November 2011. After blasting their way into the enemy command ship, Max and http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] proudly display their child, cradled in http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia]`s arms and wearing a tiny pink and white spacesuit, to the hostile Zentradi. Max smiles as http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] explains that Komilia "was created by the two of us...". The hostile Zentradi, who have had no exposure to human culture and have never seen a baby before, become terrified of Komilia and flee in fear, causing chaos aboard the command ship and disorder throughout the enemy fleet. This allows the earth forces and the allied Zentradi to seize the factory.
In the original Macross series, Max and http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] have seven natural daughters and adopt a Zentradi girl over a period of twenty years from 2011 to 2031. The oldest is Komilia Maria Fallyna Jenius, who is the only one seen in the original series. The youngest is http://anidb.net/ch14046 [Mylene Flare Jenius], who becomes a major character in http://anidb.net/a442 [Macross 7]. http://anidb.net/ch41428 [Emilia Jenius] is seen briefly in http://anidb.net/a443 [Macross 7 the Movie: The Galaxy`s Calling Me!].----------
In http://anidb.net/a996 [The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?], an animated film adaptation of the original series, Max and http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia] met in a completely different way. After the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] returns to Earth, the Meltrandi, under the command of Lap Lamiz, launched their own campaign against the Macross. The Meltrandi fleet sends in their highly trained http://anidb.net/ch49048 [Queadluun-Rau] power armor fighters, led by their ace pilot, http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia Fallyna], to retrieve a Protoculture tablet containing an ancient song they believed could help them defeat their Zentradi enemies. In the ensuing battle with the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] and subsequent death of http://anidb.net/ch10508 [Kakizaki Hayao], Max and http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia] fight against each other. In the last phase of the battle, Max and http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia] enter the Lap Lamiz`s ship and there, Max manages to down his opponent. Upon breaching the armor, Max is enamored by http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia] as she is with him, and expresses his awe at the Meltran pilot.
In the final battle between http://anidb.net/ch49057 [Boddole Zer] and the Macross fleet, a macronized Max is seen with http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia] battling together in their respective specialized blue and red http://anidb.net/ch49048 [Queadluun-Raus]. This scene is one of the few scenes showing Max without his glasses.
Another difference in the movie is that after http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker]`s death, Max is promoted to leader of the Skull Squadron, thus having Hikaru Ichijyo and http://anidb.net/ch10508 [Kakizaki Hayao] briefly as his subordinates.Source: wiki</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Bruno J. Global is of Italian ethnicity. Before commanding the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross], Global`s commanding officer during the U.N. Wars was http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa]`s father. He was the captain of the U.N. Navy submarine Marco Polo and the UN Spacy Oberth class space destroyer Goddard, which engaged and destroyed her hijacked sister ship Tsiolkovsky in the first ever use of reaction weaponry in real ship-vs-ship space combat during the U.N. Wars. Bruno J. Global rose through the ranks of the United Nations Forces thanks to his exploits during the Unification Wars until he was assigned as Captain of the flagship of the infant Spacy, the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] fortress.
During the skirmishes of Space War I, Global came up with various strategies (with a little help from First Lieutenant http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa]) to evade the Zentradi, rather than attacking them head-on. The most tragic event under his command came with the collapse of the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross]` ill-fated omnidirectional barrier, wiping out a large city in the Ontario region. The event caused a wider rift between him and the U.N., leading to the temporary exile of the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] from Earth. Eventually, when http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia Fallyna] of the http://anidb.net/ch10537 [Lap Lamiz] fleet defected to the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] and wished to marry http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Maximilian Jenius], Global gave them permission, and by doing so made the first true step toward peace with the Zentradi.
After Space War I, he took an administrative position in the U.N. Government and designed the Human Emigration Project, a space colonization scheme followed by the U.N. for the following years to ensure the survival of mankind and its culture in case of further appearances of Zentradi and Supervision Army fleets. In the Macross continuity he became an admiral as well as commander of the U.N. Spacy after the battle against http://anidb.net/ch17601 [Boddole Zer]. He survives the Macross series to become U.N. Representative in 2014, and retires from the Spacy as a full Admiral.
He married Miho Global in March 2003. It`s unknown if they had any children, or if they survived the Battle with the http://anidb.net/ch17601 [Boddole Zer] Main Fleet.Source: wiki</description>

<description>Hayao Kakizaki is an U.N. Spacy japanese variable fighter pilot who was assigned to the Vermilion Squadron, along with http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Maximilian Jenius], to be under the command of http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru]. He pilots a brown-white http://anidb.net/ch48787 [VF-1A Valkyrie] in the television series and in http://anidb.net/a996 [The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?] movie he pilots a green-striped http://anidb.net/ch48787 [VF-1A Valkyrie]. Among the pilots of the Vermillion Squadron, Kakizaki is the least serious and skilled. His characterization adds to an already heavy laden humorous anime even more comic relief. He is portrayed also as being a laid back character, which often at times would endanger him while out battling the Zentradi. Compared to his teammates, Kakizaki is also the least experienced pilot, and from time-to-time, http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] and http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] had to save him from being killed.On November 2009, when Gunsight One`s radar system was damaged, Kakizaki, along with http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] and his superior, http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru] accompanied http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa] to scout the surrounding of the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross]. During this mission, he and the others were captured by the Zentradi. This marks the first contact between the races.
In episode 19: Burst Point, Kakizaki was killed in action when the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross]`s barrier system overloads and Kakizaki`s Valkyrie was caught in the blast field. In the Macross chronology, he was KIA just after the episode of http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker]`s death. However, in http://anidb.net/a996 [The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?] movie, he was killed in battle by missiles fired by a group of Queadluun-Raus led by http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia Fallyna] while joking with http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] and http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] (Ironically underestimating their enemy`s strength due to them being female).Source: wiki</description>

She and fellow bridge officer http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa] are close friends, and she is often there to give her friend advice on matters of the heart (especially when it comes to http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Misa]`s confused feelings for http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru]), something http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase] is awkward in. She used to be in a close relationship with http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker] until his death.
She is known as Claudia Grant in Robotech.

<description>Vrlitwhai Kridanik is a Zentradi fleet commander in charge of his own fleet under the http://anidb.net/ch17601 [Boddole Zer] Main Fleet. As a commander type Zentradi he is much larger and stronger than the normal Zentradi soldier and can even survive in the vacuum of space for limited periods of time, allowing him to go toe to toe with a Battroid.
The Vrlitwhai fleet was pursuing surviving Supervision Army ships when they stumbled on Earth and the rebuilt http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross]. When the booby trap system in the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] fired on Vrlitwhai`s recon team it started Space War I. The fact that the humans possessed reaction weaponry (nuclear devices) — a technology the Zentradi have lost — and that the humans were "miclone" roused Vrlitwhai`s curiosity and made him pursue the Macross personally and relentlessly, even as his orders changed with every new revelation concerning the Humans. Because of his long exposure to human culture, he was one of the early defectors to the human side, helping in ending the war in the battle of February 11, 2010. In the aftermath of Space War I, he also helped capture a Zentradi factory satellite for the new United Nations in October 2011.
Years after the war was over and peace was signed, the new U.N. assigned him as commander of the New U.N. Spacy in 2016 A.D.Source: wiki</description>

<description>Exsedol Folmo is an alien Zentradi records keeping officer (a walking living encyclopedia) attached to fleet commander http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai Kridanik], and would always be seen at the side of his superior during Space War I giving advice. He is a Zem First Class "Archivist" Official in the http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] Fleet and his memory capacity is said to surpass any electronic device that ever existed, as he keeps details of every combat in the entire 500,000 year old Zentradi history for instant recall. During their first contact with the humans and upon their discovery that they were miclones, Exsedol advised that they should be left alone, quoting an ancient Zentradi battle directive. However, this particular piece of advice was ignored by his superiors.Much later, when the http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] fleet had decided to defect to the humans side, he was micloned and sent to the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] as a peace envoy. When the war ended and UN Spacy was re-established he joined up as an advisor. Some time later, he reverted to his larger size and his body went through major alterations as a precaution against him losing the trove of information lying in his mind, which explains his altered appearance in the later Macross productions.Source: wiki</description>

<name>Quamzin Kravshera</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Quamzin Kravshera is an alien Zentradi commander known as "The Ally Killer" for his aggressive tactics that usually involve destroying both the enemies and his own men. He supposedly died with http://anidb.net/ch10537 [Moruk Lap Lamiz] in 2012, in one last suicidal attempt to destroy the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross].Not much is known of Quamzin`s history before the series` timeframe, other than he possesses three ancient Glaug officer battlepods that were recovered by other Zentradi thousands of years ago.
He entered Space War I when the commander of the Adoclas fleet, http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai Kridanik], ordered his battalion to join up with http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai]`s fleet to aid in the capture of the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross]. The choice of Quamzin was a particularly unsettling one for http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai]`s archivist http://anidb.net/ch10515 [Exsedol Folmo] who believed Quamzin to be irrational, selfish, violent and as dangerous to his own side as to the enemy. This perception was reinforced when, while recklessly coming out of spacefold right into the main fleet, Quamzin`s ships collided with some of http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai]`s force — and that Quamzin and his men had placed bets on how many ships they`d hit. He was immediately dispatched to Mars in a plot to disable the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] while she was landed and taking supplies from an abandoned U.N. Spacy base on the planet. The plan failed. However, this merely led the megalomaniacal Quamzin to continue to redouble his efforts, including disobeying http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai]`s direct order on not harming the http://anidb.net/ch2173 [Macross] while conducting an intimidation barrage. He destroyed the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross]` radar installations, forcing http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa], http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru], http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Maximilian Jenius] and http://anidb.net/ch10508 [Kakizaki Hayao] to conduct a recon mission, and resulting in the foursome`s capture.
Finally, Quamzin undertook a daring, almost suicidal plan—he used the http://anidb.net/ch2173 [Macross]` devastating "Daedalus Attack" against the ship by forcing his troops up the http://anidb.net/ch48825 [Daedalus]` boarding ramp. In the end, Quamzin`s troops were able to do massive damage to Macross City before the assault fell apart. Some of the Zentradi who had taken part in the assault were actually defectors smitten by the ship`s culture and the ship`s resident singer, http://anidb.net/ch7418 [Lynn Minmay]. As Quamzin got wind of the idea, he began to turn on all of his troops, and finally succeeded in inadvertently chasing them all off the ship.
Soon after, http://anidb.net/ch17601 [Boddole Zer], the commander of the Zentradi fleet, arrived to finally put an end to what he saw as the corrosive effects of culture. Quamzin, unwilling to take part in a Zentradi civil war (http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] and his fleet had recently decided to take up the defense of the Earth alongside http://anidb.net/ch2173 [Macross]) departed for parts unknown, and disappeared from the historical record for two years.
Those two years had been spent building a base for a Zentradi militarist revival. He recruited Zentradi who had either been not fully "cultured" or who had grown disenchanted with their new, peaceful lives and wanted to return to a time of constant warfare. In the jungles of South America, his small but loyal cadre worked to restore a Zentradi ship that had crash-landed intact during the battle with http://anidb.net/ch17601 [Boddole Zer] and, in furtherance of this goal, assaulted a number of newly established cities across the globe. Among the most damaging of the assaults was the last one, the battle of Onogi City on Christmas Day, 2011. Quamzin, as he and his forces left with the reactor that was their target, left a nasty surprise behind: Detonator-controlled bombs that levelled great swathes of the city. With the reactor, the restoration of the ship was complete.
Quamzin, with a fully operational Zentradi ship under his feet again, was ready to do the thing http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] never did: Incapacitate or destroy the http://anidb.net/ch2173 [Macross]. In January 2012, Quamzin`s ship, with his new love, http://anidb.net/ch10537 [Moruk Lap Lamiz] (the two had made this one concession to a culture they otherwise despised) on board, made their run for Macross City in Alaska. The run ended with Quamzin ramming his vessel into the http://anidb.net/ch2173 [Macross], causing massive damage to both ships. With that, he was presumed dead, although the Zentradi militarist resistance he helped foster would still be active as late as the 2050s.Source: wiki</description>

<description>Milia Fallyna is an ace http://anidb.net/ch48911 [Quimeliquola Queadluun-Rau] power armor pilot, a female of the giant race of warriors known as the Zentradi. Serving on board an all-female ship in the http://anidb.net/ch10537 [Lap Lamiz] fleet, she joined Commander http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai Kridanik]`s investigation of the "miclones" of Earth, and their spacecraft, the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross]. After being beaten in a pitched battle against the human pilot http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Maximilian Jenius,] she volunteered for micloning and, reduced to human size, infiltrated the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross]. Rather than espionage, her real aim was to find and kill the man who had humiliated her. At a video game arcade, she again finds herself unbeatable until she is challenged to a duel by http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max], an incredibly skilled pilot and the pilot whom Milia had dueled against in real combat. Milia concludes (correctly) that http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] must be the ace pilot which she faced in real combat. http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] asks Milia out on a date, and Milia accepts although she secretly plots to kill him. Later, when http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] meets with her in a park, Milia reveals that she is a Zentradi and tries to kill him with a knife. After a short fight, http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] disarms her. Beaten for a third time, she falls to her knees, begins to cry and asks http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] to kill her. Yet, despite everything that has occurred, http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] puts his finger under her chin and the two look into each other`s eyes for a long moment. It is then that Milia has a revelation: that the emotion http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] had awoken in her was not hate, but love. The two seem to float towards each other and then passionately kiss. They are then quickly married and Milia puts her life as a Zentradi warrior behind her, choosing instead to live with http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max].
After defecting to the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] and marrying http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max], Milia was allowed to become a member of the UN Spacy in her own right and piloted a red-painted http://anidb.net/ch48789 [VF-1J Valkyrie] Fighter into battle thereafter as her husband`s wingmate. However, caring for her own people, she convinced http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] and the other pilots to capture, rather than kill, their Zentradi opponents. This deed actually saved the ship during an all out attack by her race to destroy the ship as it, among other events, led to mutiny in the Zentradi forces severe enough for Commander http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] to call a cease fire.Source: wiki</description>

<description>Boddole Zer is the supreme commander of the 4,795,122-ship Boddole Zer Main Fleet belonging to the main antagonists, the Zentradi.
Golg Boddole Zer ordered his subordinate http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai Kridanik] to track down and recover the Supervision Army spaceship which had crashlanded on Earth, thus starting Space War I. After the failures of http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] and his other subordinate http://anidb.net/ch10537 [Moruk Lap Lamiz] to capture the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] and their subsequent "cultural contamination" by the miclones, Boddole Zer ordered all 4,795,122 ships in the Boddole Zer Main Fleet to fold to Earth and destroy the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross], the defecting Zentradi forces, and the Earth itself in 2010. Boddole Zer was killed when his massive flagship was destroyed in an unorthodox tactic by the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross], but not before he ordered the obliteration of the Earth`s surface with less than one million human survivors in the Battle with the Boddole Zer Main Fleet.Source: wiki</description>

<description>For thousands of millennia, an ancient war raged across the Milky Way Galaxy unbeknownst to the human race. In July 1999, that war came to humanity`s doorstep when a super-light-velocity spaceship crash-landed on Earth. The United Nations commences an investigation of the crash site located on South Ataria Island in the North Pacific Ocean. The spacecraft is given the code name Alien StarShip-1 (ASS-1) and investigations in the months following the crash uncover startling discoveries. Giant aliens, some five times the size of a human, crewed the craft which is revealed to be a warship; a Gun Destroyer from a faction called the Supervision Army. Most important of any discovery found in the alien spacecraft is the advanced technology contained within it. Given the name "OverTechnology," the United Nations Government (U.N.G) coordinates research quickly to understand it.
In 2001, several countries including Japan, United States, Russia, Germany, Britain, and France collaborate to establish an alien technology research institute called OTEC. Less than a year later, the OTEC commences a project to restore and reconstruct the ASS-1 to be commissioned as a capital ship for the newly formed United Nations Government. From February 2001 forward, the spacecraft is designated as the SDF-1; Super-Dimension-Fortress-1. Incredible advances are made from the research including the thermonuclear reaction system used to power the craft, the gravity control system, the space fold system for traveling faster-than-light and the super-dimension-energy cannons, the main weapon of the SDF-1. These technologies are adapted quickly and soon OverTechnology is being utilized in dozens of industries, notably super-small-scale thermonuclear reactors and the development of thermonuclear reaction bombs. Despite these unprecedented leaps of progress, many problems arise and threaten to undermine the launch of the SDF-1.
Originally set to launch in 2006, civil unrest abroad and the outbreak of the Anti-Unification Wars slows the SDF-1 restoration project. Eventually, the "UN Wars" cease on January 20th 2007 and the SDF-1 is rescheduled for launch in February 2009. It is the day of the launching ceremony that the opposing faction of the ancient war tracks the residual energies left by the ASS-1`s space fold and follow it to the Sol system. The newly christened SDF-1 Macross, armed with a heretofore undiscovered automated defense system, activates in response to the approaching enemy forces known as the Zentradi. The main cannon of the SDF-1 Macross fires from the surface of the Earth and destroys two Zentradi ships some 280,000 km out in space. The remaining Zentradi retaliate and intense fighting ensues. In an attempt to maneuver and regain the initiative, Captain http://anidb.net/ch10507 [Bruno J. Global] activates the space fold system to transport the SDF-1 Macross into Lunar orbit. Due to limited human understanding of the space fold system and improper instrumentation, the SDF-1 Macross folds far beyond the Moon, transporting the ship and much of the surrounding surface of South Ataria Island out past Pluto. This single engagement initiates the beginning of Space War I between the UN Spacy and the Zentradi.Over the length of more than a year during which Space War I is fought, the SDF-1 Macross travels from the outskirts of the Sol system back to Earth, fighting the forces of the Zentradi. The Zentradi are determined to capture the vessel, obsessed with the secrets of the ship`s obvious reconstruction and reaction weapons. This advantage allows the Macross to effectively use it`s formidable defenses, thwarting many attempts to be captured by the enemy. After Space War I ends on March 10th 2010, the Macross landing site is chosen as home for the reconstruction of Macross City. The Macross takes part in one more major engagement against rogue Zentradi Kamjin Kravshera`s forces during the Defensive Battle of Macross City in January 2012. Despite extensive damage following the battle, the Macross is repaired and undergoes a major refit. To this day, the Macross remains the home of the U.N. Military Command Center and is berthed in Macross City on Earth.

<description>The largest conventional Zentradi warship seen in Space War I, a Nupetiet-Vergnitzs Class vessel was the lead warship of the Bodol Zer Main Fleet`s 67th Glruimual class branch http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] (Adoclass) Fleet. A medium-scale fleet command battleship, the original design for this class of vessel was completed during development competitions in the early years of the Schism War.

http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai Kridanik], the Zentradi in command of the Nupetiet-Vergnitzs, was on a search and destroy mission to find Supervision Army survivors when his fleet came upon residual traces of a Supervision Army gun destroyer`s defold reaction some ten light years away from Earth. The gun destroyer was naturally the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] and http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] led his fleet in an operation to intercept it. When the gun destroyer was found completely reconstructed, http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] led many relentless missions to capture the ship, including a daring operation using his own Nupetiet-Vergnitzs vessel as bait.Though http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai]`s Nupetiet-Vergnitzs was damaged repeatedly during Space War I, the ship remained fully operational during the war and even survived battle against the Bodol Zer Main Fleet. Repaired following the end of the war, the vessel was re-commissioned thereafter and became the first battleship of the New United Nations Forces in December 2012.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/nupetiet-vergnitzs.htm</description>

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>After the crash-landing of the Alien StarShip-One in July 1999 it is discovered the alien crew was a race of giants some five times the size of a human. Fearful of being unprepared for a conflict with these aliens, the newly formed United Nations Government (UNG) begins researching anti-giant weapon systems technologies. Utilizing the now named OverTechnology found on the ASS-1, the non-variable humanoid mecha called the Destroid is designed; another weapon system is the transformable Battroid. The UNG contracts Stonewell and Bellcom to develop an all-environment variable fighter eventually known as the "Valkyrie." Rising to the challenge, Stonewell and Bellcom subcontract with OT reaction powerplant producer Shinnakasu Heavy Industry and Destroid developer Centinental to complete a basic design by 2005. The first transformable prototype is successfully tested in 2007 and the UNG decides to formally adopt the Valkyrie in November of that year. By late 2008, mass production is in full swing on the VF-1A variable fighter.
From February 2009 to March 2010, the VF-1A Valkyrie served as the standard variable fighter of the U.N. Spacy in Space War I. The VF-1 proved to be an extremely capable craft, successfully combating a variety of Zentradi mecha even in most sorties which saw UN Spacy forces significantly outnumbered. The versatility of the Valkyrie design enabled the variable fighter to act as both large-scale infantry and as air/space superiority fighter. The signature skills of U.N. Spacy ace pilot http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Maximilian Jenius] exemplified the effectiveness of the variable systems as he near-constantly transformed the Valkyrie in battle to seize advantages of each mode as combat conditions changed from moment to moment. The basic VF-1 was deployed in four minor variants (designated A, D, J, and S) and its success was increased by continued development of various enhancements including the GBP-1S "Armored" Valkyrie and FAST Pack "Super" Valkyrie weapon systems.
After the end of Space War I, the VF-1A continued to be manufactured both in the Sol system (notably on the Lunar facility Apollo Base) and throughout the UNG space colonies. Although the VF-1 would eventually be replaced as the primary VF of the UN Spacy by the VF-4 Lightning III in 2020, a long service record and continued production after the war proved the lasting worth of the design. The VF-1A was without doubt the most recognizable variable fighter of Space War I and was seen as a vibrant symbol of the U.N. Spacy even into the first year of the New Era 0001 in 2013. At the end of 2015 the final rollout of the VF-1 was celebrated at a special ceremony, commemorating this most famous of variable fighters.

Manufactured by the VF-1 designer Stonewell and Bellcom, the VF-1D ironically saw the fewest compliment of the main four VF-1 variants aboard the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross], but nonetheless was an active-service variable fighter. A number of VF-1D units were also deployed as advanced training variable fighters, for live weapons and full combat functionality instruction. A VF-1D unit designated VT-102 was one such example with the label "Stud Seat" (Student) and "INST CAPT. DAGGER" (Instructor) found upon the exterior of the cockpit (this was the same variable fighter flown by then civilian pilot http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru] in February 2009).

Unlike Stonewell/Bellcom`s VF-1D, the VF-1J remains a single seat fighter but shares the slightly increased firepower of that variant. The new head unit of the VF-1J (developed by Kyuusei Industry) features two Mauler RÖV-20 anti-aircraft laser cannons in a slightly improved configuration. Naturally, when the Shinnakasu-designed GBP-1S "Armored" system was given first operational deployment, it was installed on a VF-1J.

<description>The final of the four minor VF-1 variants, the VF-1S carries the heaviest weapon load of the standard variable fighter.

The VF-1S mounts four of the Mauler series RÖV-20 anti-aircraft laser cannons and enjoys several upgrades in addition to firepower. The engines are improved Shinnakasu Heavy Industry/P&amp;W/Roice FF-2001D models resulting in measurably improved thrust and an enhanced avionics package is featured in each VF-1S. While usually reserved for CAGs (Commander of Air Group), the VF-1S also sometimes finds itself serving as the variable fighter for a squadron leader much like the VF-1J.

<description>The ARMD Class vessels were designed as space carriers for variable fighters and other U.N.S. spacecraft. The ARMD began construction in April 2003 at the Lagrange Point 5 manufacturing station. The first two carriers ARMD-01 and ARMD-02 were commissioned in July 2008 and October 2008 respectively and were opertaional prior to Space War I in February 2009. Built by OTEC Company, the ARMD carriers featured OverTechnology with gravity control systems, a reaction heat pile system and even the fold drive (though this super dimension navigation system was never implemented). At 430 meters in length, the ARMD carriers were much smaller than the large http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] and both ARMD-01 and ARMD-02 were originally meant to dock with the larger craft when the ship achieved orbit during its maiden voyage.
As a carrier vessel, the ARMDs held numerous ships and mecha. ARMD-01 held 78 SF-A3 Lancer II space fighters and 270 QF-3000E Ghost fighters (as well as an unknown number of VF-1A variable fighters) just prior to Space War I. In addition to several hundred fighters, the ARMD carrier was armed with many weapons including beam cannons, small anti-aircraft cannons and launchers as well as large anti-ship reaction warheads. The ARMD possessed many large vernier thruster nozzles positioned all over the craft. These powerful thrusters granted the ARMD excellent maneuverability in space and also proved very useful for combat engagement and evasion.Both ARMD-01 and ARMD-02 were destroyed in the first battle of Space War I on February 7, 2009. However, both vessels engaged in combat with the Zentradi fleet and proved quite successful in destroying several large Zentradi capital warships with their anti-ship reaction warheads. Eventually, six more vessels of the ARMD Class were commissioned and both the original ships were replaced. To this day, ARMD-01 and ARMD-02 remain docked with the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] on Earth.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/armd.htm</description>

<description>A large craft with a formidable armament, the Gnerl is the primary mass-production fighter for the Zentradi forces. Though possessing only a minimally aerodynamic hull, the Gnerl is nonetheless capable of operation within a planetary atmosphere by relying upon powerful thrusters and variable cant vectoring planes that double as control surfaces in an atmosphere. In space, the craft is ever more nimble and is capable of maintaining pace with the variable fighters of the UN Spacy. In combat, the Gnerl`s primary weapon is a forward mounted, triple-barrel beam gun that can fire rapid bursts from the non-rotating barrels (the gun discharges from each barrel in sequence). In addition to the main gun, the Gnerl features six internal missile launchers capable of firing up to four missiles in a single volley. A reliable craft with plenty of firepower, the Gnerl was used extensively during Space War One.

<description>Large-scale construction in space was just one of many new endeavors brought about by the development of OverTechnology. To assist in zero-g construction operations, the U.N. Spacy contracted equipment manufacturer Glamor to build a multi-purpose craft for use in space. The Glamor Spider Bug was developed to meet the needs of construction in space and to assist with any other general-purpose functions. With four large manipulator arms, a heavy-duty grasping claw and a large fuel tank, this one-man space craft was soon employed in hundreds of operations all throughout the Sol system. The U.N. Spacy often kept these units aboard many of their capital spaceships and a Glamor Spider Bug was seen inside the hangar of ARMD-01 when Space War I began in 2009.

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>Simple, efficient and reliable, the Esbeliben Regult is the standard mass production mecha of the Zentradi Army. Produced in staggering numbers to fill the need for an all-purpose mecha, this battle pod accommodates a single Zentradi soldier in a compact cockpit and is capable of operating in space or on a planet`s surface. In space, the Regult makes use of two booster engines and numerous vernier thrusters to propel itself at very high speeds, capable of engaging and maintaining pace with the UN Spacy`s VF-1 variable fighter. Within an atmosphere, the Regult is largely limited to ground combat but retains high speed and maneuverability. Armed with a variety of direct-fire energy weapons and anti-personnel/anti-aircraft guns, the Regult is capable of engaging both air and ground units. The Regult is also capable of high, thruster-assisted leaping that allows the pod to cover long distances and engage low flying aircraft. On land, the Regult is surprisingly fast, capable of closing with the VF-1 variable fighter in GERWALK flight (though likely unable to maintain pace at full GERWALK velocity).
The Regult saw much use during Space War I in repeated engagements against the forces of the UN Spacy, but its lack of versatility against superior mecha often resulted in average effectiveness. Several variants were seen in the war, typically with additional equipment to mount missile launchers or modified with electronic warfare equipment for ECM and reconnaissance roles. Possessing minimal defensive features, the Regult is a simple weapon that performs best in large numbers and when supported by other mecha such as Fighter Pods.

<description>The Regult, being the Zentradi Army`s main combat mecha, was designed to be equipped with many optional weapons to increase effectiveness and adapt to different mission requirements. One of these variants of the standard Regult is the Light Missile Carrier. Sacrificing the aft-mounted anti-aircraft laser cannons, the Light Missile Carrier features two missile launchers on a single mount. Each of the two launchers features twelve guided missiles for use in close combat. The missiles utilized can vary significantly from single warheads to energy beam "flechette" missiles. Optimizing the weapons payload, the Light Missile Carrier has the option of firing single warheads, rapid succession payloads or burst groups of two-to-four missiles. Though primarily used for anti-aircraft/anti-mecha purposes, in large numbers the Light Missile Carrier is a danger even to large capital ships and is often found in mixed groups of Regult mecha along side Heavy Missile Carriers and standard Regults.

<description>Another variant to the standard Regult battle pod, the Heavy Missile Carrier utilizes two missile launchers in place of the standard aft-mounted anti-aircraft laser cannons. Using a single mount connected to the dorsal fuselage, the missile launchers of the Heavy Missile Carrier house only four heavy missiles. However, the missiles are outfitted with multiple warheads and are capable of destroying even the most heavily armored mecha. In most combat sorties, the Heavy Missile Carrier was used in conjunction with Light Missile Carriers and standard Regults, maximizing the combined arms of the Zentradi Regult mecha forces.

<description>The Glaug is a larger and more heavily armed tactical pod used by unit commanders in the mecha forces of the Zentradi Army. Increasing the firepower beyond the standard Reguld Battle Pod, the Glaug is built with two arm units each holding one large-bore and one small-bore impact cannons and the Glaug also is equipped with a rare long range top-mounted, electron beam cannon. Along with the standard two anti-personnel cannons on the front ventral side of the fuselage, the Glaug can operate in nearly any capacity. To handle the increased power demands, the Glaug has a much more powerful single fusion reactor. Like the Reguld, the Glaug is ground based within a planetary atmosphere but uses numerous vernier thrusters and powerful dual engines for space flight.
The Glaug was customarily used much more frequently in the Zentradi mecha forces but has become somewhat of a rarity in the modern age of Space War One. Roughly 280,000 cycles before the present era, the Supervision Army succeeded in an all-front attack upon the Roiquonmi fully automated weapons factory, thus seriously reducing the Zentradi`s supply of Glaug mecha. The rarity of the Glaug persisted until roughly 3,700 cycles before the present era when a supply of nearly new Glaug units was recovered from an opened weapons storage facility. http://anidb.net/ch10516 [Quamzin Kravshera] repeatedly made use of a Glaug during his campaigns in Space War One and possessed a supply of the mecha to replace damaged units.

<description>Proof that second place can strike gold, the MBR-07-Mk II Spartan may have lost out for first in the destroid design competition, but this mecha was too good for the U.N. to pass up. The MBR-07 followed roughly a year and a half after the first destroids began design, entered trial production in 2005 and by 2008 field units were beginning first rollout. A simple but incredibly efficient mecha, the Spartan combines numerous weapons and a compact chassis to create a very potent close-combat war machine. The Spartan`s center-mounted multi-gun weapons array is complimented by two, twelve pack missile launchers on either side of the torso and rounded out with a dual anti-aircraft laser cannon mounted just behind the cockpit hatch. In addition to these ballistic and beam weapons, the Spartan`s two hands are powerful grappling claws capable of tearing through the armor of enemy mecha and over-powering any full-sized Zentradi soldier. The Spartan uses a standardized control cockpit, allowing pilots of most other U.N. Forces mecha to easily master control of this battle robot.Valkyrie pilot http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru] operated a Spartan in battle against Zentradi malcontents at the Highlander City airport in late 2011. Utlizing the superior hand-to-hand combat ability of the Spartan and a familiar control cockpit, http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou] and his combat team were able to easily subdue both mechanized Zentradi and infantry units attacking the airport. During the battle, Captain http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou] utilized a mecha-sized combat baton to down a http://anidb.net/ch48811 [Reguld] and incapacitate unarmored zentradi soldiers. Throughout Space War I and following the war, the Spartan continued to be a thorn in the backside of the U.N.

<name>HWR-00-Mk.II Monster</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>An immense mecha, the Heavy Weight Robot (HWR) Monster Mk II is a heavily armed "land battleship" with a name matching the great size of the destroid. Very shortly after the initial research into the destroids began in 2000 the HWR-00 series began development in December that year. After a lengthy design phase trial production began in October 2005 and the HWR-00 Monster first rollout was in September 2008. The Monster is the largest mobile ground weapon to ever be fielded in battle by mankind, over 41 meters long and weighing almost 300 tons. The Monster was envisioned as a trackless, self-propelled heavy weapon system to be utilized for attack and point defense. In actuality, the Monster`s massive size, poor maneuverability and dedicated long-range weaponry saw the mecha used as a semi-mobile artillery unit best utilized while avoiding uneven ground and any close-range engagement. When put to best use with supporting units in a combined arms role, the Monster is able to field incredible firepower equal to strategic bombing.
The Monster was originally designed to use 50cm linear cannons, but was scaled down with smaller guns when problems arose with system strength and insufficient power for continuous firing. Armed with four 40cm cannons, the Monster can fire a variety of munitions with the primary guns, including anti-armor shells, anti-aircraft munitions, howitzers and even nuclear reaction warheads (OverTechnology reaction warheads have an explosive yield rated at 0.1 kilotons to 50 kilotons). In addition to the main guns, the Mk II features a pair of 3-barreled missile launchers not originally included in the design but incorporated into the two arm units. To compensate for the Monster`s vulnerabilities such as the intense heat emissions of the unit (which prevented effective use of counter measures such as chaff or smoke), the armor was designed to be extremely thick and even capable of withstanding a near hit from a reaction weapon.
Though mass-produced like the other destroids, only two Monster Mk II units were onboard the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] during the outbreak of Space War I. During the conflict, the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] onboard factories made use of equipment for several more Monster mecha and produced a third unit to accompany the original two. Most of the other Monster units were destroyed by orbital bombardment from the Zentradi fleet. The few Monster Mk II units aboard the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] distinguished themselves as very capable war machines during Space War I. While most destroid units suffered heavy losses, the Monsters aboard the ship remained in active service for most of the war and the capability to launch reaction warheads was put to use during the battle with the http://anidb.net/ch17601 [Boddole Zer] Main Fleet in February 2010.

Once successfully tested, the Tomahawk became the basis for three other Destroid types and the improved Tomahawk Mk VI quickly followed in late 2007.
The Tomahawk Mk VI is the most heavily armed Destroid of the MBR-04 series and the most widely deployed model. Of the nearly 600 hundred Destroids aboard the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] in February 2009, over 500 were Tomahawk Mk VI units. Armed with a wide array of weaponry suited to nearly any combat operation, the Tomahawk features particle cannons, missiles, machine guns, lasers and flamethrowers to unleash fire in any role from anti-personnel to anti-aircraft. The Mk VI version also features a retractable periscope and includes the option of mounting searchlight/missile packs in one or both mounts on either side of the top weapons bays.

A multi-purpose vehicle, the Quel-Quallie`s primary role was as a reconnaissance craft, but potent weaponry and a large internal cargo bay made the ship suited to many operational roles. For reconnaissance missions, the Quel-Quallie featured a large and powerful sensor cluster. Prepared for combat at any range, the theatre scout had two long-range dual-cannons mounted on the front as well as several missile launchers capable of omni-directional firing. On the underside of the Quel-Quallie, two large bay doors could be opened to allow deployment of the sensor cluster or as an entrance/egress for friendly mecha. On either side of the ship are two telescoping landing spires on rotating mounts which are retracted and stowed parallel to the hull during flight. The ship was built to last and featured a strong armored hull that could sustain significant damage before the craft`s systems failed.The most notable deep space operation involving a Quel-Quallie in Space War I was "Blue Wind," a scouting and intelligence gathering mission conducted by a three-member team consisting of Loli Dosel, Conda Bromco and Warera Nantes. The civilian population of the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] had begun public broadcast of radio and television aboard the ship, transmissions the Zentradi forces could detect over distance but were too low-powered to properly intercept. The Quel-Quallie sent to analyze these transmissions encountered a GBP-1S "Armored" Valkyrie and was ultimately destroyed. Fortunately, all three of the crew escaped in the Boreregue escape pod and reported what they saw of the "alien" transmissions. Another notable use of the Quel-Quallie was a surface operation by Zentradi Commander http://anidb.net/ch10516 [Quamzin Kravshera], who used a Quel-Quallie as a transport for a stolen reaction engine.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/quel-quallie.htm</description>

The modular system allows the two sections to operate independently and both are heavily armed with hangar bays carrying large mecha complements. While the orbital module can still enter a planetary atmosphere like most Zentradi warships, the ship has limited maneuverability. Although this class has been in use for hundreds of millennia, as has most of the Zentradi fleet, the Queadol Magdomilla was born in the middle stages of the Galactic Empire`s Schism War and is thus one of the newer ships of line.

One such concept was to create an anti-aircraft destroid that could mount powerful, super-far-range weaponry for firing in space. A joint development program by Viggers-Chrauler was authorized by the U.N. Government and resulted in the eventual deployment of the Mk X Defender Destroid. Utilizing the standard destroid ambulatory system, the Defender featured a new upper chassis with two, double barrel Erlikon Contraves II weapons systems firing 78mm rounds. These impressive wide-bore guns fired 500 rounds per minute from each of the four barrels and had a muzzle velocity of 3,300 meters per second. Two large ammunition drums mounted on top of the chassis fed through the weapons bays for fast firing and designs were eventually made for enlarged magazines featuring a much greater ammunition capacity.
The Mk X Defender Destroid proved successful and was approved for mass production. Unfortunately the weapons systems were prohibitively expensive and notoriously difficult to manufacture, resulting in a lengthy lead-time to deployment. The first Defender units saw action shortly after the beginning of Space War I but only in limited numbers. Forty units were manufactured aboard the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] and served throughout the war along side other destroid units. Though the Defender was a capable mecha, as a defensive unit in constant front line engagements, these destroids suffered heavy losses during the war.

<description>A vessel so large it is better classified as a small stellar mass than as a spacecraft, the Fulbtzs Berrentzs Class is the colossal mothership of the Spiral Nebula Arm Central Fleet also known as the Boddole Main Fleet. At over 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) in height, the Fulbtzs Berrentzs commands a fleet of 4,795,122 Zentradi capital warships. Several sets of massive bay doors litter the outside of this gargantuan vessel allowing ships larger than the http://anidb.net/ch48777 [Nupetiet-Vergnitzs] to travel dozens of kilometers through the flagship`s hull and into the open interior. Inside the mothership, thousands of Zentradi warships can be docked and re-supplied. In the center of the open interior lies the main command spire, a massive pillar stretching from the bottom to the top of the vessel interior. It is within this spire that the bridge can be found and where http://anidb.net/ch17601 [Golg Boddole Zer] leads the nearly five million warships at his command.At the end of Space War One, the Fulbtzs Berrentzs mothership appeared in orbit over Earth and lead the Zentradi Boddole Main Fleet in an attack that destroyed the surface of the planet, killing nearly the entire human species. A combination of the U.N. Spacy`s Grand Cannon, the Adoclas fleet`s 1,200 ships, the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] and a psychological attack subjecting the Zentradi to music and imagery of male/female contact forbidden in Zentradi society enabled the U.N. forces to fight their way inside the mothership. The http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] then unleashed hundreds of reaction warheads inside the ship and the craft exploded. Although only one Fulbtzs Berrentzs class mothership was ever encountered by the U.N. forces, it is estimated there are still some 1,000-2,000 ships of this class commanding fleets within the Milky Way Galaxy.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/fulbtzs-berrentzs.htm</description>

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>The largest and arguably most devastating Zentradi mecha of Space War I, the Queadluun-Rau battle suits of the female division forces are fast, maneuverable and well-armed mecha. Like the Nousjadeul-Ger of the Zentradi male division forces, the Queadluun-Rau is a powered suit of armor featuring two reaction furnaces that power massive dual engines, propelling the suit at tremendous speeds. A special inertia vector control system gives the Queadluun-Rau unparalled maneuverability and allows efficient atmospheric flight using only vernier thrusters, effectively compensating for the suit`s lack of aerodynamic lift. In battle, the female powered suit relies upon a deadly array of rapid-fire laser and particle cannons, but most lethal of all are the missile launchers. Armed with over a hundred individual short-range missiles, the Queadluun-Rau is capable of engaging dozens of targets, inflicting heavy damage with torrents of guided missile fire.
Most famous of all Queadluun-Rau units in Space War I was the personal mecha of Zentradi ace pilot http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia Fallyna]. Her incredible skills were legendary; http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] was undefeated in her military career up until Space War I. Such was her prowess that her reputation was known even among the Zentradi male divisions, a point of contention for http://anidb.net/ch10516 [Quamzin Kravshera]. Infuriated by http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Millia]`s harsh criticisms of his failures in battle against the forces of the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross], http://anidb.net/ch10516 [Quamzin] cunningly goaded http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] into battle against http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Maximilian Jenius], the ace Valkyrie pilot of the UN Spacy. In her Queadluun-Rau, http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] sought the enemy ace eagerly, but was soundly defeated in battle by http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Jenius] in his http://anidb.net/ch48787 [VF-1A Valkyrie] and barely escaped with her life. It is also notable that another Queadluun-Rau unit was responsible for the attack upon Major http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker]`s http://anidb.net/ch48790 [VF-1S Valkyrie] fighter, the incident which ultimately proved fatal for the veteran ace pilot. Capable of deployment in any environment, the Queadluun-Rau could engage enemy forces in space, in the atmosphere or on the ground. Despite a lack of emphasis upon long-range weaponry, the Queadluun-Rau exceled at medium-to-close range combat and was one of the most versatile and successful Zentradi mecha.
Following the Great Interstellar War (Space War I), the Queadluun-Rau units were employed by the U.N. Forces. Unfortunately, breakdowns in production at the Factory Satellite caused a gradual decrease in operational units. Operational rates were reduced such that by the 2030s the Queadluun-Rau could not be supported by available spare parts. Fortunately, support for reproduction of the Queadluun-Rau remained strong. In 2035, variable fighter design and manufacturing company General Galaxy was entrusted by the U.N. Forces with a modernization and reproduction plan for the Queadluun-Rau.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/queadluun-rau.htm</description>

<charactertype id="4">Vessel</charactertype>
<description>A potent warship, the Quiltra-Quelamitz class vessel is an often forgotten but significant part of the Zentradi fleets. Though the craft is somewhat small by the standards of most Zentradi ships of the line, it possesses one of the most devastating weapons of the fleet. The forward half of the craft is dominated by the main gun, a heavy converging energy beam cannon. The bow splits in half vertically, collimating the energy of the blast just prior to release. The main gun can blast through the most heavily armored hypercarbon hulls of enemy spacecraft and can rain high-energy mass destruction down upon a planetary body. With it`s powerful primary weapon, the Quiltra-Quelamitz is the backbone of any large-scale fleet-to-fleet engagement and a necessary tool for operations requiring effective planetary bombardment. Though primarily an anti-ship/anti-fortifications vessel, the Quiltra-Quelamitz does feature many conventional cannon emplacements upon its hull and carries a modest complement of Nousjadeul-Ger powered armor suits for anti-mecha attack and defense.Aside from its role in the destruction of planet Earth on February 2010, the most notable operation involving a Quiltra-Quelamitz class ship was during the Defensive Battle of Macross City in January 2012. Zentradi warlord http://anidb.net/ch10516 [Quamzin Kravshera] commanded a Quiltra-Quelamitz in his failed attempt to destroy the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross]. During the battle, the main cannon of the Quiltra-Quelamitz inflicted fatal damage on the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] with a single shot, penetrating the hull and destroying the ship`s main reactors. Though the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] was able to briefly return fire via auxiliary power, the Quiltra-Quelamitz was able to remain aloft after a direct hit from the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] super-dimension-energy cannon. The Quiltra-Quelamitz then rammed the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] in a suicide run, but only succeeded in severing the starboard arm and docked http://anidb.net/ch48825 [SLV-111 Daedalus] carrier from the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1] before crashing to the ground just beyond the shore of Lake Macross.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/quiltra-quelamitz.htm</description>

After the space worthy conversion of the http://anidb.net/ch48774 [CVS-101 Prometheus] and the http://anidb.net/ch48825 [SLV-111 Daedalus] carriers they were docked with the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] and required a special unit mecha to defend both vessels. Development of the Phalanx began during the war in July 2009 and quickly reached rollout in December of that year. Roughly 20 Phalanx destroids were built aboard the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] shipboard factories. Armed with dozens of missiles in two large launchers, the Phalanx made an excellent semi-mobile missile-based battery (minor variants featured armaments such as a head-mounted gatling gun). During the final battle of Space War I against the Zentradi Boddole Zer Main Fleet, the Phalanx units were repainted and refitted to fire long-range reaction warheads for use against space warships. When the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] broke through the Zentradi fleet defenses and entered the interior of the massive http://anidb.net/ch48908 [Fulbtzs-Berrentzs] command vessel, all the Phalanx units unleashed their missiles and aided in the swift destruction of the enemy flagship.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/destroid-phalanx.htm</description>

<description>Meeting the need for a powered battle suit in the male division of the Zentradi Army, the Nousjadeul-Ger is a functional if unremarkable mecha. The battle suit is operated by a single pilot and possesses a small armament with just enough weapons diversity to match most foes. The Nousjadeul-Ger`s primary weapon is a large plasma cannon mounted across the back engine mount, capable of being swiveled forward and ready to fire very quickly. In short range battle, the suit is equipped with a torso mounted impact cannon and can carry a variety of small arms in either (or both) of the hands.
The strength of the Nousjadeul-Ger lies in its versatility for all-environment deployment and suitability for most combat operations. When on a planet, the Nousjadeul-Ger is not limited to surface operations like the http://anidb.net/ch48811 [Regult] nor is it strictly an air unit like the http://anidb.net/ch48795 [Gnerl]. The battle suit can engage in long-range flight within the atmosphere and can use this capability to broaden its combat effectiveness using its limited array of weaponry. The suit is also an excellent close-quarters, large-scale combat unit, capable of swift hand-to-hand fighting and possessing enough physical strength to cripple the most heavily armored enemy mecha. Lacking superior firepower and designed without preference for any single combat situation, the Nousjadeul-Ger is nonetheless a practical mecha capable of competent performance in most operations.

Destroids and variable fighters were still several years away from being realized so the new technologies developed by the OTEC research institute would be used to build a fighter called the F-203 Dragon II. The F-203 began design only a year and a half after the establishment of OTEC and was formally adopted as the main fighter of the U.N. Forces in 2003. Built as a delta wing aircraft with OverTechnology, the F-203 was stronger, faster and more efficient than previous fighter aircraft. The craft was much more maneuverable than conventional fighter aircraft and was light despite equipment for V/STOL capabilities. http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker] flew an F-203 during his service as a fighter pilot in the United Nations Wars.
