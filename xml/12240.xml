<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="389009">For those of you who`ve read the manga, you`ll understand what`s going on.
Those of you who haven`t, this is another case of FMA, the story starts from midway of the first season, so not a direct sequel from episode 25, but from episode... 15? or so...? Right after everyone found out he`s a demon from the fight with Amaimon and started avoiding him. Might get confusing, but if you read the manga you`ll understand.

Kyoto arc is one of the best. If you like Rin, you`ll REALLY like this anime.
It`s also where I started really hating Yukio as a character.  Whiny brat.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="764835">As mentioned previously if you watched the first season then the sequel you will experience deja-vu...at least I did.  For some reason the first few episodes go through the same drama that the MC sorted out in S1, as his teammates come to grips with him being "a son of Satan" which we experienced already.  But after getting through that and the set up for the Kyoto arc S2 is ok.  

If you liked S1 then you will probably enjoy S2 even though it is half the episodes.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on http://anidb.net/cr23050 [Katou Kazue]`s manga by the same name, serialised in http://anidb.net/cr31875 [Jump Square].
In the late Edo Period, a demon known as the Impure King killed thousands of people. After defeating the demon, the Knights of the True Cross kept its left eye safely sealed away on Academy grounds, but now someone has stolen it! Hearing the thief has taken a child hostage, http://anidb.net/ch25809 [Yukio] and http://anidb.net/ch25808 [Rin] go to help. The investigation and pursuit will lead Rin and his friends to Kyoto and involve them even deeper in a sinister plot. But will his friends` knowledge that Rin is the son of Satan drive a wedge between them?

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<description>In Western lore, demons are often described as minions from Hell, generally known to attack humans and feast on their flesh or possess the bodies of those with weak souls. In Eastern lore, on the other hand, they are generally supernatural, often but not always malevolent beings who can be more mischievous than actually evil, or simply supernatural spirits of no specific alignment.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>Okumura Rin</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The fifteen year-old protagonist of the story, Rin is the son of Satan born from a human woman and is the inheritor of Satan`s powers. His powers were sealed at birth into the demon-slaying blade Kurikara, or Koumaken, by Mephisto Pheles, allowing him to live a normal human life for about 15 years. Rin became aware of his true identity after Kurikara could no longer seal the blue flames he inherited from Satan, setting a chain of events that led to the death of his guardian, Father and Exorcist Fujimoto Shiro, at the hands of Satan who attempted to drag Rin back to the demon realm. Exorcist Mephisto Pheles confronted Rin after Shiro`s funeral with several exorcists, giving Rin the option to kill them all or die. Rin instead demanded to become an exorcist, an idea that amused Mephisto. Rin was then enrolled personally by Mephisto into the True Cross Academy Exorcist School, and since been pursuing his goal to become a Paladin and to defeat Satan. He is currently an Exwire and attempting to gain the title of Meister as a "Knight" (an exorcist who fights with a sword).
Rin can tap into the power he has inherited from Satan through the use of a demon-slaying katana, called Kurikara or Koumaken. The sheath acts as a portal to Gehenna (the demon world) which when drawn returns Rin to his demon form. While in his human form, Rin exhibits a number of physical traits that are signs of his demonic nature, such as sharper-looking teeth, slightly pointed ears, and a black, fur tufted tail (which he keeps hidden in his shirt). As a demon, Rin gains two blue flames that float above his head, long, elf-like ears, and his eyes turn bright blue. In both forms Rin can control incredibly destructive bright blue flames, the trademark sign of anything related to Satan. However, when he draws Kurikara, the magnitude of the flames dramatically increases and often leads to Rin being "consumed" by his own flames and losing his mind. Rin also has a demon Familiar Cat Sith, Kuro, who was initially Father Fujimoto`s.</description>

<description>Rin`s younger twin brother. Though Satan`s powers were expected to be split between them, due to the weakness of Yukio`s body at birth, Yukio did not inherit any of Satan`s powers. Yukio received a Mashou at birth from his brother, allowing him to become aware of demons since he can remember. Yukio secretly trained to become an Exorcist since age seven in order to protect Rin (through the help of Fujimoto). While both Yukio and Rin are in their first year at True Cross Academy, Yukio is already an instructor at the Exorcist cram school who teaches Anti-Demon Pharmacology to Rin`s class. It is often stated that Yukio is a genius, having already acquired the title "Meister" in both the Dragoon and Doctor class, while ordinarily most people would aim for Meister in one class (both are still fully qualified exorcists). He is currently ranked a Middle First class exorcist.</description>

During her encounter with Rin and Yukio, they were able to discover that Shiemi was having her life force leached out by a Demon. After Yukio exorcised the demon, Shiemi finally decided to become an Exorcist and started to attend class. It was later revealed that Shiemi had talent in becoming a Tamer, as she was able to summon a Greenman Spirit during class. It is apparently a rare talent to possess amongst the Exorcists, where there are only a few who can control demons and fight.</description>

<description>Shima Juuzou is the second son of the Shima family. As the second son, he has more responsibilities than his younger brothers. He is also an Upper Second Class Exorcist.
Juuzou is first introduced while fighting http://anidb.net/ch85283 [Houjou Mamushi] over their families, and although at first he is advising his younger brother http://anidb.net/ch68237 [Kinzou] not to get into a fight with her, he subsequently gets quite worked up about it, resulting in a physical confrontation. However, he seems to be more level headed and responsible than Kinzou, and less laid back than http://anidb.net/ch25818 [Renzou].
He is serious when it comes to his duties, and has showed concern about his childhood friend Mamushi, as well as taking care of his father. He has a lighthearted side and gets on well with his two youngest brothers.

<description>Toudou Saburouta was one of the Exorcists sent out to retrieve back the Left Eye of the Impure King.
While he and the rest of the team chased after the culprit, the culprit managed to take a little boy as a hostage, confining himself in a building afterwards. http://anidb.net/ch25809 [Yukio] arrived at the scene, accompanied with http://anidb.net/ch25822 [Shura] and http://anidb.net/ch25808 [Rin], and was briefed by Toudou about what happened. They put on a protective suits and entered the building.
After that, it was revealed that the Left Eye of the Impure King was actually the fake and that Toudou already had it and was possessed by a demon.
Sometime later, he was assisted by http://anidb.net/ch85283 [Houjou Mamushi] in stealing the Right Eye of the Impure King and, with that achieved, breaking the seal put on the Impure King and releasing him afterwards.</description>
