<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="204142">This is a recently finished manga, the anime cuts-off a quarter of the way through. A playful OST and simple rendering style don`t compete for your attention from the focus, the characters. First-borns will understand this, as the necessary inheritors of family tradition and will, conflict oft arises when tradition is questioned. Especially when that tradition concerns a centuries-old duty to ward away ayakashi. While Yoshimori lacks the book-smarts, and studious nature of his neighbor, rival, senpai, and love-interest Tokine, when it comes to her, their families, and friends, he has the will to succeed, even if he doesn`t quite know how he`ll get there.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="297053">The whole story is great but in my opinion, I must say I definitely strongly hate the main character. He is so childish, pathetic, talk too much and noisy but in the end, can not do anything. His character development is so long  until this character finally become "adult" (till fews last eps)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="273014">great watch&lt;br /&gt;a must watch for shounen fans</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="130887">I really love this show, too bad there is no second serie... :(</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="144860">superb anime, amongst my favourites</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="372950">Simply good. But could be 26Eps</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="498732">Kekkaishi surprised me a lot. It`s from a genre I don`t like, but the show is filled with nice moments, very few fillers, has good characters and creates an excellent atmosphere. Worth seeing it, even those who dislike animes using old-japan themes and typical shounen stuff.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="100670">Definitely not bad.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="237276">one of the best</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="190271">I don`t think a lot of people know about this series but I may be wrong. I really loved it. I think everyone should at least give it a chance. After a few episodes and the introductions the story really gets going and going well.</recommendation>

<description>http://anidb.net/ch2734 [Sumimura Yoshimori] is a normal 14-year-old middle-school student, though he always falls asleep in class. This is however due to his night duties, in which he takes on the role of a Kekkaishi (Barrier Master).
Together with http://anidb.net/ch2741 [Yukimura Tokine], his neighbour and childhood friend (/sweetheart), he serves as a protector for the school which holds a few ancient secrets. These secrets are slowly being unraveled, which may play a role in Yoshimori`s ultimate plans.</description>

<description>Delinquents - Every school has them, but not all anime with school setting make delinquents a central topic. There are several versions of these delinquents, though some are grounded on a misunderstanding:
* The student with a really bad image and attitude, based on his real criminal actions outside of the school and is even feared by teachers.
* The primitive "class bully" that pushes around ("clobbers") his classmates for no apparent reason, possibly extorting lunch money.
* The student with an sinister complexion or "evil eye", but is actually a "good" student (unfoundedly feared character).
* The rebellious student, who does not care for studying, but is otherwise docile. Called a "delinquent" as a joke.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<name>protection complex</name>
<description>A character has a protection complex if the character is overly protective of other characters, beyond what would be considered a "normal" or "expected" duty of care.
The magnitude of overprotection can vary. It can be as low as constantly nagging someone to "stay safe". It can be as extreme as the protector making it their mission in life to protect the other character.</description>

<description>"TETSUOOOOOO!!" "KANEDAAAAAA!!"
"TAMAHOMEEEE!!" "MIAKAAAA!!"
Feelings of any kind towards other characters are best shown by calling each other`s name, loud, REALLY LOUD. For better effect at least twice or thrice. For lover`s couples and mortal enemies it is a requirement to run towards each other while calling each other`s name, unaware of the surroundings.</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<rating votes="17">6.71</rating>
<name>Sumimura Yoshimori</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The main character. Yoshimori is a 14-year old middle school boy who is the 22nd kekkaishi of the Sumimura family. In the series, Yoshimori is portrayed as a lazy, stubborn headstrong creature who strives his best to protect his friends and his family. The younger Yoshimori was different from the current Yoshimori, in the fact that he likes to cry a lot more and who heavily dislikes executing his duties as a Kekkaishi. The situation that had brought about the change in Yoshimori was when Tokine was injured by an ayakashi which he could have dispatched, but did not due to his kindness, allowing the ayakashi to become more powerful and escape his barrier. Tokine had moved to protect him, destroying the creature but getting mauled in progress. After the incident, Yoshimori had changed drastically towards his attitude towards being a Kekkaishi. At the beginning of the series, he is often baking cakes and/or other sweets, and seems to be more important to him than his duty as a Kekkaishi. He has dreams to become an expert patissier where he can enjoy making pastry castles. He is often chastised by his grand-father for this hobby.
As a Kekkaishi, Yoshimori cannot be matched by his counterpart, Tokine, in terms of power and speed because of his lack of accuracy and tendency to tumble into a situation without thinking about it beforehand. During the series, observations had been made by Sumimura Shigemori and Sumimura Masamori that Yoshimori has an enormous wellspring of latent abilities in his kekkais. It has also been noted that Yoshimori is able to activate "zekkai" without any particular training beforehand. However, his zekkai could only be powered to its full potential in moments when his emotions overflow their boundaries. Only two occasions had been shown with him using his fully powered zekkai in the current running of the series - once while fighting against Kaguro, and the other while saving his brother Masamori from getting hit by a fatal attack.

<name>Madarao</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A white demon dog that has served the Sumimura family since its founding; passed down to them by the founder Hazama Tokimori. Madarao is able to detect ayakashi with his amazing sense of smell, which he often brags is far better than Hakubi`s. However, no matter how fast he locates an ayakashi, Yoshimori could never dispatch them fast enough, a fact Madarao often bemoans. Madarao is around 500 years old, and prior to his existence as a demon, was a wolfdog known as Ginro (銀露), and was at one time friends with Kouya. He wears a "collar", made of spirit beads and seals strung together with a nenshi, that seals away his true demon form. When not assisting Yoshimori, he resides inside a special stone covered with glyphs, which is humorously located inside a wooden doghouse. When unsealed, Madarao become very large and uses powerful poisons and illusions. Madarao seems to have an unrequited crush on Hazama Tokimori; apparently, the reason he had followed him was because he fell in love with him on first sight. Throughout his service to the Sumimura Family, Madarao had refused to acknowledge anybody as his real master other than Hazama Tokimori, however, after the battle with Kouya, Madarao begins to view Yoshimori as his master.

<name>Sumimura Shigemori</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The grandfather of Yoshimori and the 21st head of the Sumimura family. Shigemori is a very hot-headed man and who often battles it out with the Yukimura Tokiko next door about the subject of the true successor. This has ranged from insults to battles conducted in midair. He also enjoys hitting Yoshimori on the head with his Legitimate Successor`s Chop when he deems Yoshimori to be lazy and not hardworking enough to compete with the Yukimuras. Under Shigemori`s blustery façade, he seems to care a lot about his family and Tokiko`s wellbeing.[Spoiler] One bone of contention with him was that Sumimura Masamori had managed to enter the Urakai, whom he heavily distrusts and dislikes. However, he had apparently given up trying to dissuade Masamori from continuing on working in the Urakai, telling Masamori that that would be his own way of protecting Karasumori. It is alluded to that Shigemori is a highly skilled Kekkaishi. Masamori, a highly skilled Kekkaishi in his own right had informed Shigemori that he was no where near his level when Shigemori had complimented him. In the anime, during Kokubourou`s first wave of attack, Shigemori was portrayed drawing up an enormous Kekkai around the house and creating shikigamis even after dispatching Shion`s lackeys without any signs of exhaustion; and also made a kekkai strong enough to block the nine tail demon fox princess`s initial personal attack on Karasumori.[/Spoiler]

<name>Sumimura Masamori</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The oldest son of the Sumimuras. Although he is the oldest of the three brothers, Masamori was not chosen as the heir, which had always been a source of mystery to him and Yoshimori, the latter stating many times in the series that in terms of skill and power, Masamori should have taken the position of heir. He is 21, though he looks much older. Masamori is the leader of Night Troop.[Spoiler]He is later also the 7th seat of the board of the Shadow Organization, in which he had struck up a highly uneasy and unpleasant relationship with Ougi Ichirou, the 8th seat, whom clearly despises and hates him. He is a very skilled Kekkaishi; mastering highest defense technique, mastering difficult techniques and able to activate zekkai. However, one noticeable difference about Masamori`s zekkai and Yoshimori`s zekkai was that Masamori was only able to destroy with it. He is not able to create his zekkai in such a way that he can protect the people in it other than himself. Some characters had noted that this was probably the reason why Masamori was not picked as the legitimate successor. Masamori is apparently a manipulative creature, he had struck deals before with Matsuda Heisuke in staging his fake death and manipulating Kasuga Yomi to enter Karasumori and later making use of her as an informant. Currently, it is not sure what his true aims are.[/Spoiler]

<description>Yoshimori`s mother. She can use the Hazama-ryuu Kekkai technique, but is not a legitimate successor. Very rarely seen in the manga and anime. She is described as a "skilled Kekkaishi" and is said to hunt Ayakashi elsewhere, though a reason why is not given. On her first mission for the Urakai she killed the god she was assigned to calm down, claiming its child told her to kill it.

<name>Yukimura Tokine</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Yoshimori`s friend and "partner". Tokine is 16 years old and the 22nd Kekkaishi of the Yukimura family.
She bears a scar on her right hand, which she received while protecting Yoshimori in their childhood.
Tokine is gifted with great accuracy and precision, however, her kekkai are very weak and can only be maintained for short periods of time; her kekkai lack the "brute power" of Yoshimori`s kekkai.
At first she attempts to make up for this by copying Masamori`s technique of stacking several kekkai`s around a target, but this takes too much stamina for her, making the technique ill-suited for her. Later, she learns to refine her kekkai into narrow "spears" that can impale and imprison an enemy, making up for her lack of power. She also has the ability to manipulate kekkai and space, this is seen when she cannot dispel Yoshimori`s kekkai and so manipulates it so she is able to pass through it and then again during the time a user kidnaps members of the Yagyou she uses his portal to enter the dimension he created.
She cares for Yoshimori and often protected him many times when he was younger. She also likes to tease him and isn`t aware of his feelings for her, although as the story progresses she begins to shows signs of deeper affection for Yoshimori. Tokine is clearly impressed by the power and potential Yoshimori has, but is constantly frustrated by his poor control and lazy attitude. In the series, it is stated that whilst she may be the weakest Kekkaishi, she is clearly the most "ruthless". Examples of her ruthless pragmaticism are her disregard for the health of Hachiouji Kemiya when he was possessed by an ayakashi and forbidden metsu of a shinyuuchi god that had invaded karasumori and attacked its defenders.</description>

<summary>The events are shown of what Yoshimori and Tokine do on a typical day, showing Yoshimori is a slacker who sleeps through class, while Tokine is a smart and popular student. The personal lives of the two main characters are delved into a little more as well showing their relationships with their close family. Yoshimori obsesses with making pastries, specifically chocolate castle cakes. When Yoshimori and Yokine track down a frog ayakashi called Tsuchigama at night, Yoshimori wears sneakers to protect Yokine from its attacks. Yoshimori is left to restore the school grounds as he heals his wounds, by the use of his shikigami (paper dolls).</summary>
