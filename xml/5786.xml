<description>* Based on a seinen manga by http://anidb.net/cr10184 [Gokurakuin Sakurako], serialised in http://anidb.net/cr23601 [Young Gangan].
http://anidb.net/ch11546 [Sahashi Minato] is very intelligent, yet due to his inability to cope with pressure has failed the college entrance exam twice. As a result he has been branded an idiot and loser by many. One day after talking to his yet again disappointed mother he comes into contact with a girl named http://anidb.net/ch11361 [Musubi], who was under attack. The girl runs but takes him with her and soon finds that Minato, while unknown to him, is an Ashikabi, one of the mysterious set of masters that have the genetic trait that can become partners with some of the 108 cute girls, buxom women, and bishoujo called Sekirei. Only by means of such a partnership can the Sekirei use the full potential of their powers to win in the competition held by the ominous MBI corporation.

<name>horny nosebleed</name>
<description>In Japanese media, healthy young men who have no other sexual outlet will often suffer nosebleeds upon seeing the naked female body, or even just a pair of well-filled panties.
The nosebleed is, of course, a visual shorthand/euphemism for sexual arousal. It is commonly interpreted that way for males and females, with little trickles of blood indicating mild arousal, and gushing fountains of blood indicating erection/extreme arousal in both sexes. It can also be interpreted as shorthand strictly for erections in males. In that case, when blood shoots from the nose explosively, and in ridiculous quantity, the implication would be an ejaculation.

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>swimsuit</name>
<description>A swimsuit is one of several kinds of garments designed to be worn by people engaging in water-based activities or sports or during certain activities under sunlight. Most kinds of swimsuit reveal a large portion of the body surface area, but exceptions exist. The more revealing kinds may also be worn as undergarment in sports that require wetsuits, or when there is a need to display the body, as in the case of beauty pageants or bodybuilding contests.
There is a very wide range of styles of modern swimsuits, which vary in relation to body coverage and materials. The choice of style of swimsuit is dependent on current fashions, community standards of modesty, and plain personal preference. Swimsuits for men usually expose the chest, while those for women do not usually do so; however, many women prefer to engage in water or sun activities with their torso uncovered, in a practice commonly described as toplessness or topfreedom. Since the early twentieth century a naturist movement has developed in western countries that seeks a return to non-sexual nakedness when swimming and during other appropriate activities; in some places around the world, nude beaches have been set aside for people who choose to engage in normal beach activities in the nude, and such beaches may or may not enforce nudity onto their goers.
In anime, it is common for at least one episode to feature the characters in swimsuits, usually as an excuse for gratuitous fanservice; when that happens, the episode is usually labeled a pool or beach episode, after the place the characters went to. Swimsuits, and in particular one-piece swimsuits, are a very common fetish in Japan; while the reason for that is uncertain, a common folk explanation is the fact that boys throughout their entire adolescence are commonly exposed to their female classmates wearing them, in what might be called an experiment in sexual discovery waiting to happen.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>large breasts</name>
<description>Large breasts are breasts a fair notch larger than average, as found in some adolescent girls or fully grown women; however, as anime has no upper limit to breast size, the definition applies somewhat differently. To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>violent retribution for accidental infringement</name>
<description>A comedy / slapstick element often found in Ecchi anime: The hilarity derives from spontaneous embarrassment, overreaction of the "victim" (girl), immediate retribution for a seemingly inappropriate act, and a sense of pity with the supposed "aggressor" (boy).
Typically a boy will - through no fault of his own - stumble into a girl, thus invading her personal space. In the process the boy may e.g. pull down her skirt, grab the girl`s breasts, or accidentally kiss her. Any level-headed girl would see the accident just for what it is. Not so the girl with an overly developed sense of modesty, and a thing for violence. She - often a tsundere - will clobber the boy with excessive brutality.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<name>alcohol</name>
<description>Alcohol (or more scientifically, ethanol), is one of the world`s oldest psychoactive substances. It is traditionally found in the form of a beverage such as beer, wine, or liquor, although in some contexts it can be inhaled to produce similar or intoxication, and some people prefer another way of consuming beverage-form alcohol.
Alcoholic beverages are many and varied, due to production methods (fermentation or distillation), source materials (grains, fruits, vegetables, other plants), added substances such as flavorings, and many more ways of defining different forms of alcoholic beverages.
Alcoholic beverages are divided into three general classes: beers, wines, and spirits. They are legally consumed in most countries, and over 100 countries have laws regulating their production, sale, and consumption. In particular, such laws specify the minimum age at which a person may legally buy or drink them. This minimum age varies between 16 and 25 years, depending upon the country and the type of drink. Most nations set it at 18 years of age.</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<description>The power of love is not only the strongest power known to mankind, it is the strongest power in the universe. The power of love conquers all things. It makes people cry, it makes people laugh, it can make them sing and occasionally it even brings dead people back to life, just so.
More so than the power of friendship, the power of true love gives boundless strength and resolution; by the power of love every hardship can be overcome, every issue can be resolved and it does make people resistant to food poisoning (caused by the bad cooking of their loved ones). Even the big bad evil doesn`t stand a chance against the power of true love and often ends up redeemed.
Even when the power of love is not literally and directly responsible, the scene is often set so that the audience is left with the impression that it was "really responsible".</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Musubi (Sekirei #88) is the main heroine of the series. She met Minato when she literally fell out of the sky while being chases by other Sekirei.
Musubi specializes in hand-to-hand combat which utilizes her greatly enhanced strength, enforced by the heavy combat gloves she always wears. Musubi`s `uniform` consists of a short red skirt and her upper clothes resemble those traditionally worn by a Miko. During periods of anger or jealousy, an image of a ferocious bear appears behind her, which is a result of her being Miya`s disciple. She is quite naive, often saying things she doesn`t understand and is the most "childish" of Minato`s Sekirei, even more so than Kusano, yet at times can be insightful. Musubi is the most "competitive" of Minato`s Sekirei, often showing great eagerness to fight other Sekirei, but never fails to be polite as she would usually ask for permission first before fighting them. She eats a lot and is a fairly decent cook, but she can only cook curry in large amounts. Musubi`s known attacks are the Kuma-ken (Bear Fist) and Kuma-ryusei (Bear Meteor).</description>

Matsu refers to herself as the "Wisdom" Sekirei and uses the "-tan" suffix in everyone`s names. One of her favorite hobbies is watching the mayhem Minato and his other Sekirei cause every day. Matsu`s primary role is as Minato`s unofficial strategist, rarely venturing outside of the Inn and using her vast network of information to aid him.
Matsu has the power to access and analyze any electronic device on a telepathic level. Her name literally means "Pine".</description>

She trains both Musubi and Tsukiumi to help them win the Sekirei battle. Whenever she becomes angry, annoyed, or if any person breaks the rules of the house, and when she is giving threats, a demonic visage appears behind her and is frightening enough to scare even Homura and Tsukiumi into submission.</description>

Kusano refers to Minato as "onii-chan" (big brother), and is the most attached to him. She does not like fighting or quarrelling and she can be seen stopping them when they start. She is very impressionable and often copies Musubi and Tsukiumi`s mannerisms. She has expressed a desire to be Minato`s wife when she grows up.
Kusano has the power to control plants, making them grow at an accelerated rate and to unnaturally large proportions, and typically uses them to ensnare or disable her opponents without hurting them. Her name literally means "A Grass Field". Her MBI adjustments were never completed, which is why when she`s sad or upset, her powers rage out of control.</description>

<name>Sahashi Minato</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The main protagonist. He is 19 years old (virgin). Minato`s known family consists of his mother, grandmother and younger sister; his father is unknown, but it`s hinted, that Minaka might be Minato`s father. Minato is highly intelligent, yet due to his inability to cope under pressure has failed the college entrance exam twice, and as a result he has been branded an idiot and loser.
Minato met Musubi by a stroke of luck after failing the exam the second time while she was being attacked by other sekirei. After her body reacts with his, she kisses him, activating her powers in the process. Also as a consequence of their meeting, Minato discovers that she is one of `Sekirei` and he is her `Ashikabi`, a human with special genes that allows them to activate a sekirei`s powers in a procees called "winging". After becoming an ashikabi, Minato is forbidden by the MBI to leave the city with risk of facing the MBI`s disciplinary squad if trying. This binds the Sekirei to him and allows them to use their full power in the elimination battle. In the beginning of story he had a passive personality, but gradually his kindness and love to his Sekirei and desire to protect them are making him surer of oneself and more manly.
Before the beginning of the third stage, Minato has winged six Sekirei. All 6 reacted to him (four of them are "the Single Numbers") - three at the game`s first stage: Musubi, Kusano and Matsu (her winging was end of the first stage) and three at the second stage: Tsukiumi, Kazehana and Homura (he was the last unwinged Sekirei and his winging was the final aim of the second stage). In the anime Tsukiumi was winged at the first stage and her winging was end of the first stage. Having quite a handful of strong sekirei by his side earned him recognition as the strongest Ashikabi in the northern part of the city, as well as the title, "Ashikabi of the North" (sometimes referred as "Minato of the North"), though most seem to neglect adding his name due to the fact that he was described as an Ashikabi with "shady" backgrounds. Many believe he is the key to foil the MBI`s plans for the sekirei.

<name>Kazehana</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kazehana is a tall and extremely buxom Sekirei whose first encounter with Minato was to stumble into his bed in a drunken stupor.
She takes an immediate interest in Minato, surmising that he could be Hiroto Minaka`s son because Minato possesses the same hand shape and cheek bones, but she keeps this belief to herself.
Despite experiencing physical reactions to Minato, Kazehana initially keeps her distance, hoping that Minato will display some "manliness".
After witnessing Minato`s concern and love for his Sekireis, Kazehana chooses him as her Ashikabi.
Kazehana displays an extremely relaxed personality, preferring to spend most of her time lounging and drinking sake, and often becomes giddy when discussing matters of love.
However, when she becomes serious she displays a lot of power and lets nobody (with the exception of Minaka, Miya, and Minato) talk down to her.
Kazehana knew about Uzume`s secret, and while she didn`t condone Uzume`s actions, she understood Uzume`s motivations (love for her Ashikabi).
Prior to meeting Minato, she had an unrequited love with Minaka, but was rejected because he loved someone else.
Along with Matsu, Kazehana was a member of the first Disciplinary Squad.
Kazehana has the ability to control and manipulate wind, which also grants her a limited ability of flight.
Her name literally means "Wind Flower", with Miya`s nickname for her being "Public Obscenity".
Her known attacks is the Flower Whirlwind (花旋風), Flower Dance (花の舞), Flower Feast (花宴) and Cherry Flower (花桜), and her Norito is "Wind of my pledge, blow away the dark clouds for my Ashikabi!"</description>

<name>Homura</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The self-proclaimed `Sekirei Guardian`, he used to protect `unwinged` Sekirei. Homura`s power and gender were unstable (a running gag throughout the series prior to him being winged was when he`s about to incinerate himself with his own fire, Tsukiumi would suddenly come out of nowhere to douse the engulfing flames); however, he continues to think and act as a man even after his body started becoming female (called `feminization` in the manga). For a long time, he lived under the alias `Kagari`, a popular host club entertainer (because his was looking for an Ashikabi although no, how many women he `meets` he did not react) and only Miya, Uzume, Matsu and Kazehana knew his true identity. Homura began reacting to Minato after he came to the Inn, causing Homura great stress over his potential Ashikabi being male. Near the end of the second stage, he`s revealed to be the last unwinged Sekirei. Homura left the Inn to go after the MBI Director in order to bring an end to the Sekirei Plan. However, he was attacked by multiple Sekirei under orders to capture him. Refusing to be a trophy in the Director`s game, Homura attempted to commit suicide through self-immolation, just as Minato and his Sekirei arrived. Unwilling to let Homura sacrifice himself, Minato `winged` him, saving his life (becoming the only Sekirei, which Minato has kissed willingly). Minato has the power to determine Homura`s gender and mentality, but chooses to let Homura remain who he is for now. Homura has the ability to control and manipulate fire, and is quite powerful, as Tsukiumi speculates him to be the strongest unwinged Sekirei prior to being winged by Minato; "homura" means "flame" literally.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Minato`s younger sister. She is 18 years old (younger than him by one year) a college student that is enrolled in Shindong Women`s University. Unlike Minato, Yukari has a very strong and confident personality. She comes to Tokyo to attend university and be closer to her mother and brother. She has a strong interest in handsome men, especially bishounen. This interest, however, is mostly a result of her hidden feelings for Minato, who she cares for deeply, which she cannot openly express. She is Shiina`s Ashikabi, and is helping him search for Kusano. Her forceful reputation, merciless attack style and as well as a penchant for diplaying a demonic facial visage, has earned her the title, `Demon Ashikabi`. Together with #107 Shiina they`re known as the most evil pair. They are the second-most feared right after the Hannya of the North. Carrying a bounty of 1,000,000,yen by an ashikabi who fought them. She is currently unaware that her brother is an Ashikabi and that Kusano is one of his Sekirei; she has expressed the desire that such a pairing might occur. Yukari has recently been taken prisoner by Izumi Higa in order to use Shiina`s power for himself. She seem to be unaware what Shiina is doing in her absence.</description>

<description>Minaka Hiroto is the eccentric chairman and founder of MBI, with his motto being: "Fight and Fight Until One is Left." He, along with Takami, discovered the Sekirei and because of this, he feels that this entitles him to be the "Game Master" of the Sekirei Plan. Takami states that he has always been thought of as a "super genius," but in reality, she thinks that he is insane and his actions throughout the story seem to support this. It is hinted by Seo that he might have had something to due with Takehito`s death, or at the very least, did nothing to prevent it. In chapter 100 it is revealed that Minaka is indeed the illegitimate father of Minato, but only because Takami refuses to allow him into her family. He has expressed that he still wants to be a family with Takami, and is currently giving Minato a chance to save Chiho if he can play a game by bringing Chiho to MBI headquarters.</description>

<name>Shiina</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Yukari`s Sekirei who is searching for Kusano, whom he has a very close, sibling-like relationship with despite the fact that his power is the natural opposite of hers.
His power, while not officially named, allows him to emit an energy wave that instantly disintegrate most forms of matter, including metal, wood, fabric, and even human flesh to a limited degree.
He met Yukari after he was attacked and was saved by her with assistance from Homura.
He shudders at the idea of almost being Mikogami`s Sekirei and thinks of Yukari as a bright shining light in his life.
Like Kusano, Shiina dislikes violence and has expressed extreme remorse for hurting Sekirei he has defeated.
Due to the overwhelming power of his ability, he is called the "Death Sekirei" and along with Yukari, are ironically considered to be the "most evil pair" in Tokyo upon reaching the Northern part of the city.
Shiina and Yukari`s reputation and power have become so feared that they have attracted the attention of Izumi Higa, who encountered them shortly after arriving at the North city attempting to find the last unwinged Sekirei, hoping it would turn out to be Kusano (who, of course, already has an Ashikabi in Minato), but was later revealed to be Kagari/Homura.
Higa later captured Yukari and uses her to force Shiina to work for him.
His only known attack is World`s End Garden (ワールド・エンド・ガーデン) and his Norito is "The corpse of my covenant, rot the cross of my Ashikabi!" His name literally means "Death".</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The manipulative Ashikabi controlling the eastern part of the city. He is shown to be rather amoral, having no qualms about forcing other Sekirei into obeying him and turning them against each other with carefully constructed lies. His motives hint that he may be intending to take over MBI. He apparently doesn`t tolerate his Sekirei disobeying him. He appears to be blackmailing Uzume, forcing her to do his bidding by holding her Chihi, her Ashikabi, hostage. In addition, there are rumors suggesting that he has a large number of personal Sekirei. Higa also has several Ashikabi (with their own respective Sekirei) that serve under him. Recently, Higa has confronted Yukari and Shiina with several of his Sekirei and Ashikabi. His Sekirei incapacitated Shiina and takes Yukari prisoner, also asking her to marry him. When Yukari berates him for breaking the rules of the Sekirei Plan, Higa simply remarks that he has no interest in being associated with such a "farce". He meets Minato during the third match of the Third Stage and asks him to join forces against the MBI, which he soon declines, with Higa stating that they`re both too stubborn (referring to both Minato and Yukari). It is later revealed that he is the heir to a powerful rival pharmaceutical company competing against MBI, and that his family owns the hospital where Chiho is staying.</description>

<description>He is the Ashikabi of Hikari and Hibiki. He is 25 years old. He works as a freelancer, whose motto is "We solve their problem with a price". Friend of the late husband of Miya who appears to be in hostel with him. Miya apparently has a very low opinion of him easily referring to him as `trash` or `scum` right in front of his face. Seo also takes odd jobs and manual labour. He does show is detests of how the MBI works and of its C.E.O. (Minaka). He sometimes eats for free at Miya`s when he is low on money (while his sekirei apologize). Seo has a gruff, wild look about him but a good man to rely on. It has been said that he has an "ability" given to him by Takehito Asama. This ability is shown to be cancellation of Sekirei`s abilities, by grabbing a hold of them, as shown during his brief fight with Tsukiumi and the meeting with the Sanada Nishi. While Seo is aware that Minato is an Ashikabi, Seo makes no aggressive action against the hero and they usually just have friendly conversations with each other. Saying I liked you from the start for some reason. He is able to tell the number of Sekirei a person has by his `strong nose`. He mention he built the secret room were Matsu hides in for Takehito.

<description>Sahashi Takami is the mother of Minato and Yukari and the MBI`s head researcher and person in charge of Sekirei Plan. She revealed that she lied about working at a pharmaceutical`s company to Minato after the escape plan when she took him in temporary custody. Whenever she`s angry or making jokes, she makes a demonic facial visage - a trait that is shared with Yukari. She, along with Hiroto, discovered the Sekirei ship. She is also the adjuster of Homura (together with Takehito), Musubi, Shiina and Kusano, possibly out of shame as she frequently expresses doubt and disgust at Hiroto for what he is doing. She has a long scar over her left eye, which she received from #43 Yomi while trying to protect Kusano. In chapter 100 it is revealed that she gave birth out of wedlock with Minaka due to her refusal to allow Minaka to be part of their family.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Known as the "Black Sekirei" and "MBI`s dog", Karasuba is the leader of the third Disciplinary Squad, with her weapon of choice being a nodachi.
In the past, Karasuba was a member of the first Disciplinary Squad and teamed up with Yume in the second Disciplinary Squad.
It is later revealed that Karasuba wanted to fight and defeat Yume and, as a result, resents Yume for "disappearing" before they could settle their rivalry.
This unsettled matter appears to have heavily influenced Karasuba`s actions throughout the story. She maintains a "friendly" relationship with Musubi (whom she calls "Muu-chan"), and the two have made a promise to be the last two Sekirei standing.
After the escape plan and the failure of Haihane and Benitsubasa, she tried to kill both of them.
Karasuba and Miya do not associate well with each other (Miya not allowing her to set foot in Izumo Inn) and tend to come close to fighting each other at the mere appearance of the other.
Her name (karasu+ba) means "raven wings" literally.</description>

After her fight with Musubi and Yume (believing to be Musubi), she keeps a hatred for Musubi after she was almost thrown across the border (which was Yume`s doing). She has a habit of sticking her tongue out while fighting and hates stupid people. She wears a kimono-like shirt with one sleeve missing and has pink hair in a side ponytail with two daisy clips. Out of the three Disciplinary Squad members, she is the only one who "loves" her Ashikabi, as she wants Natsuo to "open his eyes" (make him like women), then kill both Haihane and Karasuba so she can have him all to herself. Although the rules say not to attack Ashikabi, she attacked Minato because she thinks that "it`ll be better to get rid of him". Her name means "Crimson wings" and her attacks are Shock Wave, Shredder, and Gekeishin (extreme earthquake).</description>

Chiho first met Uzume when Uzume was running from M.B.I. the two began to trust each other almost immediately. After that, Uzume visited her everyday with her costumes and Chiho eventually became Uzume`s Ashikabi.
Throughout the series, Uzume has visited Chiho many times and her latest time was right after her failed attempt to take Minato`s newly earned Jinki.</description>

Akitsu`s power is very strong, allowing her to fight on par with Sekirei like Homura, whom she have encountered 3 times so far. Despite the fact that she can`t be winged, she considers Mikogami her Ashikabi because he took her in and she fears being thrown away again. She appears to be forgetful; at one point it was noticed she didn`t wear any panties. It was first assumed she was ordered to do so by Hayato, but then she revealed it was simply because she forgot to put them on. Like her power, Akitsu has a very cold and melancholic personality. It is possible that she is the former #07 because of her power and because it was the only number not used from the first dozen. Her name means "Autumn Port".</description>

With her Norito, she can drain the energy from her enemies while putting them to sleep, but it seems to have a weak effect from a long distance. Shigi desires to defend her and wants to withdraw from the Game by leaving Tokyo before MBI`s soldiers could capture them, and sought Minato and Kaoru`s help to escape Tokyo, which eventually succeeded despite being a bit injured along with Kuno during an encounter with the Disciplinary Squad. Kuno`s Norito is "The vow of my song, light the path of my Ashikabi!"</description>

<description>A Sekirei that was assigned to capture the "unwinged" Sekirei (Homura) for him along with Akitsu. She attempted to capture Shiina at one point but was blocked by Homura. Mitsuha hates people like Homura for being "lions of protection". She fights using a whip that is strong enough to break apart concrete. She was defeated and nearly killed by Karasuba after the latter sliced open her chest.</description>

<name>Yume</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Yume was the leader of the second Disciplinary Squad and teamed up with Karasuba in the past.
She rescued Musubi when she was a child and saved her life by giving her her "Tama", the core which gives the Sekirei life and use their powers.
Yume bears an uncanny resemblance to Musubi as seen in Karasuba`s memories.
Yume refers to herself as the "Sekirei of Fate" and is a "Defender of Love".
Yume possessed light-based powers used in conjunction with her super strength and hand-to-hand combat.
When Musubi lost her Sekirei crest fighting Benitsubasa, Yume`s soul temporarily took control of her body, defeated the Disciplinary Squad and was able to restore Musubi`s crest.
She asked Minato to "teach love to these little birds" (a reference to the Sekirei), and said that she was awakened by Minato`s warm and gentle spirit.
Her name literally means "Dream". Yume`s Sekirei crest is unique, as it does not appear on her back, rather it appears on her exposed torso with her number on it.</description>
