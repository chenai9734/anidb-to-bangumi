<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="15405">This show starts off slowly and the MC can be irritating at first but once you stick with it you`ll learn to love Fire Bomber, Basara and the Macross 7 crew. The plot doesn`t start to really progress until well in to 38 episodes and there could have been more back story on the characters (the 2 minute specials weren`t enough!) but overall it`s an enjoyable watch for Macross and new fans alike.</recommendation>

<description>In 2045 A.D., thirty-five years after the legendary Battle with Bodolza`s Main Fleet, we join the Macross 7 fleet on its journey to the center of the galaxy.
Having once faced total extinction, the surviving Humans on Earth drew up an ambitious plan to ensure their survival. Super-long-range emigration fleets (such as the Macross 7 fleet) would spread Humankind across the galaxy.
Meanwhile, close-range colonization of planets (such as Macross Plus`s Eden) would counteract Earth`s population explosion and dwindling supplies. Seven years have passed since Captain Maxmillian Jenius led the 37th long-range emigration fleet from Earth.
Inside City 7, the main habitation "block" of the Macross 7 flagship, the rock band "Fire Bomber" prepares for their first live concert. Something is amiss, though...</description>

<name>vampire</name>
<description>A vampire is a mythological or folkloric nocturnal undead. Vampires use long fangs to penetrate the necks of people, usually young females, to drink their blood, both as a form of nourishment and to turn the targets into slaves.
In the classic vampire stories, they are thought to have no reflection in mirrors, are able to shapeshift into bats (sometimes also wolves or some form of fog), have unlimited lifespan and superhuman strength, reflexes and senses, and may only be killed by silver bullets, silver blades, a stake through the heart, fire, or exposure to sunlight; on the other hand, they cannot tolerate garlic, holy water, or Christian crosses (sometimes expanded to religious symbols in general).
In modern anime, these limitations are usually dropped, and they become far more powerful and fearsome opponents than usual. A human bitten, or sometimes even scratched, by a vampire typically becomes a slave, eventually dying as if poisoned, and becoming a vampire, ghoul, zombie, or other form of undead after death, often staying under the command of the vampire who originally bit them.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>rock music</name>
<description>Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. Musically, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass guitar and drums. Typically, rock is song-based music usually with a 4/4 time signature using a verse-chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political in emphasis. The dominance of rock by white, male musicians has been seen as one of the key factors shaping the themes explored in rock music. Rock places a higher degree of emphasis on musicianship, live performance, and an ideology of authenticity than pop music.</description>

<name>Super Robot Wars</name>
<description>Super Robot Wars is a series of tactical role-playing video games produced by Banpresto. The main feature of the franchise is having a story that crosses over several popular mecha anime, manga and video games, allowing characters and mecha from different titles to team up or battle one another. Due to the nature of crossover games and licensing involved, only a few games have been released outside Japan, and in English; early English-language games only feature Banpresto`s original characters and mecha, and a flagship installment were to never be released until 2016, with the English release of Super Robot Wars V in Southeast Asian countries. The franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2016.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Born in Yokohama Chinatown, Japan (though she is of partial Chinese descent) as Linn Minmei, Minmay moved in with her uncle http://anidb.net/ch21740 [Shaochin] and aunt http://anidb.net/ch21741 [Feichun] on South Ataria Island in hopes of finding the path to fulfill her dream of becoming a star. On the day of the Zentradi invasion, she meets http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] and a series of events leads to her being swept off on the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] along with the rest of the surviving population from that island. While on the space fortress, Minmay wins the Miss Macross beauty pageant and is propelled into celebrity.When the Macross returns to Earth, she is the only civilian allowed off the space fortress. After her trip home in Japan (where her parents remained), Minmay returned to the fortress with her cousin http://anidb.net/ch10513 [Lynn Kaifun] (and http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru]`s competition for her affection) in tow. Her beauty and singing talent also win over several Zentradi spies sent to explore human society, who spread their impressions among their fleetmates, thus unwittingly evoking peace-oriented attitudes among the alien aggressors. Ultimately, Minmay sings the songs that end the first war against the Zentradi.
During the second part of the series, the very fame and success she craved finally left her tired and virtually alone. She tries to run away from her celebrity status and start anew, with a more simple life alongside http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru], who is now more confused than ever in defining his feelings for Minmay and http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa]; all of this while new conflicts arise between the human and Zentradi survivors of the first war. At the end of the series both http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] and Minmay realize they are very different people, and Minmay accepts that http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] belongs with http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Misa], remaining a friend to the couple afterwards.
In 2012, she embarks on the SDF-2 Megaroad-01 colony ship, which disappears 4 years later during its voyage towards the center of the Milky Way galaxy, becoming a legend in the Macross universe since then.Source: wiki</description>

<name>Maximilian Jenius</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Max Jenius was born in Europe. He is a young fighter pilot, having joined http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru]`s Vermillion Team, along with http://anidb.net/ch10508 [Kakizaki Hayao], at the age of only 16. Jenius shows in his first sortie that he is a preternaturally talented ace pilot who is near invincible in combat, despite his need to wear corrective lenses on duty. Max is quickly recognized as the top pilot of the force, as marked by being granted to distinctively repaint his mecha into his preferred blue color.
Jenius` skill at piloting mecha becomes even more celebrated with feats that no other pilot would have thought of, much less achieved. One outstanding incident involves his infiltrating a Zentradi battleship in his valkyrie and disguising it with a Zentradi uniform, allowing him to escape detection.
Jenius is not above an occasional egotistical musing when he is off duty, but he also respects his comrades and they return the favor. He is also an incurable romantic in his youth which shows when he meets his future wife. That occurred when the top Zentradi ace pilot, http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia Fallyna], hears about a formidable pilot aboard the humans` http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] space fortress and seeks to challenge him personally in battle. Max manages to defeat http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] not once, but thrice. The first in their respective mechas, the second in simulated combat (a video game) and finally in a knife fight to the death. It is this final fight where the two rivals fall in love. Immediately after the knife-fight in the park Max proposes to http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] who accepts. Afterward, http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] is allowed to join the mainline fighting forces of the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] and becomes Max`s wingmate on duty, piloting a distinctive red Valkyrie alongside Max`s blue one.
After the Zentradi Fleet that nearly destroys the Earth is vanquished, Max and http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] settle down in the new city built around the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] and begin a new life together. In March 2011, they give birth to a daughter (the first of seven) named Komilia Maria Fallyna Jenius. The name Komilia (which means "Little Milia") is chosen because with her green hair and green eyes, she looks so much like her mother (although it has also been suggested that the "ko" simply refers to the Japanese kanji character "child" that is often used on the end of Japanese female personal names - a suggestion which is supported by the title of episode 30: Viva Maria, as opposed to Viva Komilia). Komilia proves how related the Humans and Zentradi are. The "first stellar interracial child" is very unabashed baby, and proves resilient to http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia]`s sometimes rough and inexperienced handling. Max, despite his relatively young age, proves to be a happy and successful father, although he clearly has a strong dislike of Komilia`s playfulness with his hair. http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa] and http://anidb.net/ch10509 [Claudia La Salle] find Komilia adorable and are amazed that she isn`t shy at all, and envy Max and http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] for having such a beautiful child.
Max and his family play a crucial role in the U.N.` capture of a factory satellite in November 2011. After blasting their way into the enemy command ship, Max and http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] proudly display their child, cradled in http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia]`s arms and wearing a tiny pink and white spacesuit, to the hostile Zentradi. Max smiles as http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] explains that Komilia "was created by the two of us...". The hostile Zentradi, who have had no exposure to human culture and have never seen a baby before, become terrified of Komilia and flee in fear, causing chaos aboard the command ship and disorder throughout the enemy fleet. This allows the earth forces and the allied Zentradi to seize the factory.
In the original Macross series, Max and http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] have seven natural daughters and adopt a Zentradi girl over a period of twenty years from 2011 to 2031. The oldest is Komilia Maria Fallyna Jenius, who is the only one seen in the original series. The youngest is http://anidb.net/ch14046 [Mylene Flare Jenius], who becomes a major character in http://anidb.net/a442 [Macross 7]. http://anidb.net/ch41428 [Emilia Jenius] is seen briefly in http://anidb.net/a443 [Macross 7 the Movie: The Galaxy`s Calling Me!].----------
In http://anidb.net/a996 [The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?], an animated film adaptation of the original series, Max and http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia] met in a completely different way. After the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] returns to Earth, the Meltrandi, under the command of Lap Lamiz, launched their own campaign against the Macross. The Meltrandi fleet sends in their highly trained http://anidb.net/ch49048 [Queadluun-Rau] power armor fighters, led by their ace pilot, http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia Fallyna], to retrieve a Protoculture tablet containing an ancient song they believed could help them defeat their Zentradi enemies. In the ensuing battle with the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] and subsequent death of http://anidb.net/ch10508 [Kakizaki Hayao], Max and http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia] fight against each other. In the last phase of the battle, Max and http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia] enter the Lap Lamiz`s ship and there, Max manages to down his opponent. Upon breaching the armor, Max is enamored by http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia] as she is with him, and expresses his awe at the Meltran pilot.
In the final battle between http://anidb.net/ch49057 [Boddole Zer] and the Macross fleet, a macronized Max is seen with http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia] battling together in their respective specialized blue and red http://anidb.net/ch49048 [Queadluun-Raus]. This scene is one of the few scenes showing Max without his glasses.
Another difference in the movie is that after http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker]`s death, Max is promoted to leader of the Skull Squadron, thus having Hikaru Ichijyo and http://anidb.net/ch10508 [Kakizaki Hayao] briefly as his subordinates.Source: wiki</description>

She meets the child Basara as he gives her some food (which he had gotten by initially trying to trade his guitar to a baker, who just gave him the bread because he liked Basara`s music).

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Maximilian Jenius is a fighter pilot from Europe, married to http://anidb.net/ch41157 [Milia Fallyna Jenius].
Prior to the events of Macross 7, Max is appointed commander of the 7th Macross Fleet and captain of the flagship Battle 7, with a de-micronized Exsedol Folmo as his advisor. Although separated from Milia, he is in almost-daily contact with her, due to her position as mayor of the civilian ship City 7, and possibly continues to harbor feelings for her. Despite being in his fifties, Max appears to have aged very little from his original appearance. Character designer Haruhiko Mikimoto half-jokingly said that is the case "Because he`s a genius. Growing old is a state of mind for average men...".
Max and Milia, in addition to being legally separated from each other, are also separated from most of their children - all but their youngest daughter, Mylene Flare Jenius, have moved away from the Macross 7 fleet. Max often checks up on Mylene, whom he feels very protective of. As the series progresses, Max becomes responsible for the establishment of "Sound Force", a trio of Valkyries piloted by the members of Fire Bomber which includes Mylene. Initially, he forbids Mylene from joining Sound Force, for fear of putting her life in danger, but is persuaded to allow her to join after witnessing her skill as a pilot and musician. Max often clashes with Milia about Mylene, but the two are able to remain civil (usually) around each other for the sake of their daughter, who unsuccessfully tries to bring them together again.
Late in the series, Max and Milia are able to overcome their troubled past and resume flying together in their distinctive blue and red VF-22 Sturmvogels in order to save the fleet from threat posed by the Protodeviln. In the final battle, Max, Milia and Mylene fight side-by-side against Lord Geperunitch.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Milia Fallyna Jenius is an ace Quimeliquola Queadluun-Rau power armour pilot, a female of the giant race of warriors known as the Zentradi.
In Macross 7 Milia sports a new short hairdo rather than her original long hair in Macross. Like Max, she doesn`t seem to have aged. However, she is sensitive whenever people, especially Basara Nekki refer to her age.
Milia is elected overwhelmingly as the mayor of City 7, the largest and main ship of the Macross 7 colonization fleet. She is accompanied by Mylene, her daughter, who lives separately. Max is also present as commander of the Macross 7 fleet, although the couple are now separated. It is also implied that she still may have feelings for her estranged husband.
As City 7`s Mayor, Milia is determined not only to maintain law and order among her citizens, but to marry off the rebellious Mylene as well. In the series, Milia still possesses her red VF-1J Valkyrie, and like Max, she can still fly a Valkyrie exceptionally and as passionately as she did in the original Super Dimension Fortress Macross. Milia clearly shows signs of affection towards her antique red VF-1J when it was destroyed by Sivil while being piloted by Gamlin Kizaki.
Later in the series, Milia, while serving as City 7`s mayor, would from time-to-time pilot her Valkyrie - first piloting her VF-1J and gradually moving on to more advanced Valkyries, the VF-17D Nightmare and VF-22S Sturmvogel II respectively, all of which are coloured deep red - to assist the battle of the Macross 7 fleet against the Protodeviln and their Varauta Army. In the final episode of Macross 7, Milia and Max fought side-by-side in their own custom coloured VF-22 Sturmvogel variable fighters against Lord Geperunitch.

Indeed, it emerges that his real aim—other than to preserve the joy of the hunt over the Spiritia Farm Project—is to gather enough spiritia to reawaken not himself or http://anidb.net/ch43875 [Geperuniti], but another Protodeviln named http://anidb.net/ch43707 [Sivil], with whom he is in love.

Such is the intensity of his desire to protect http://anidb.net/ch43707 [Sivil] that he generates an enormously powerful energy field which destroys the planet Lux and, to the horror of everyone, himself.Source: wiki</description>

<description>Gavil is a human-sized being covered in white fur, with wings like those of an angel. He disdains the innate abilities of his kind in favor of technology, piloting his own http://anidb.net/ch49550 [Saubergeran] and using anti-noise and remote-controlled fighters to combat the effects of http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Basara]`s singing. Extremely vain and arrogant, he delights in the "beauty" of destruction, particularly that created by http://anidb.net/ch49520 [Glavil], whom he regards as his own "flesh" -- yet he remains loyal to the plans of Lord http://anidb.net/ch43875 [Geperuniti], though he occasionally questions his leader`s methods. He develops an intense hatred of ace pilot http://anidb.net/ch41155 [Gamlin Kizaki], who humiliates him time and again in battle, most notably on many occasions destroying his vehicle and forcing him to retreat under his own power.

Although the planet is ultimately destroyed, he has by this time transported the citizens of Macross 5 back to Varauta IV, intending to capture and use the band to create an endless supply of spiritia.Source: wiki</description>

<name>VF-11B Thunderbolt</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>In the early 2020`s, the U.N. Government found itself requiring a new type of variable fighter with a combat profile much different from that of the current VF-5000 fighter. In 2022, development began on the VF-11 Thunderbolt, a design descended directly from the original VF-1 Valkyrie (though the two Battroid mode silhouettes are similar, the structures vary greatly). After the VF-1, few variable fighter airframes were multi-environment and were limited operating either in the air or in space. The VF-11 Thunderbolt broke from the norm and was a legitimate multipurpose successor to the VF-1. The program proceded on schedule and the VF-11`s first flight was made in 2028. Early in the development process, then Captain Milia Jenius of the Eagle Nest Aerial Tactics Center became one of many vocal advocates for the inclusion of the forward canard wing on the VF-11, a design choice which caused heated debate. While the canard wing enhanced the VF-11`s maneuverability considerably in an atmosphere, the increased air resistance also limited the fighter`s maximum speed. Fortunately, Captain Jenius piloted the No. 2 VFX-11 prototype (fitted with a canard, unlike the No. 1 prototype) in an operation to rescue a U.N. chief advisor. The flight data collected during this operation convinced the U.N.G. to adopt the VF-11 with the canard wing implemented. In December 2030 mass production of the VF-11 began and the Thunderbolt officially replaced the http://anidb.net/ch49112 [VF-4 Lightning III] as the main variable fighter of the U.N. Spacy.
The VF-11 was deployed on long-distance immigration ships, colonized planets and deep outer space forces where it served well as a variable fighter with emphasis on speed, maneuverability and economy of design. The Thunderbolt excelled in all respects such as firepower, maneuverability and maintainability while showing high comprehensive performance for a general purpose machine both inside and outside of atmosphere. The http://anidb.net/ch49112 [VF-4 Lightning III] and the VF-5 emphasized deployment in outer space and the VF-5000 Star Mirage focused on atmospheric performance. By contrast, one of the factors which granted the VF-11 high-deployment status was the Thunderbolt`s multipurpose design and high level of comprehensive performance in any operational environment (similar to the superior flexibility of the VF-1 Valkyrie). Utilizing a 30 mm gun pod as it`s primary weapon, the VF-11`s had as much destructive power against modern enemy mecha in a much smaller caliber than the VF-1`s 55 mm cannon. The smaller shell size also granted the VF-11 a much greater ammunition payload and the gun pod design included extra magazines for reloading in battle. An emphasis on close-range combat capability in Battroid mode was also featured by way of an anti-mecha bayonet. In addition to the anti-aircraft pulse laser, the VF-11 included the first hard defense feature in the form of an anti-projectile shield for GERWALK and battroid modes that dramatically improved resilience. The success of the anti-projectile shield prompted implementation in future variable fighters. The success of the VF-11 also saw the development of a modern Super Part system (which gave the Thunderbolt missiles in space) and the APS-11 Protect Armor system for special operations.
The VF-11 Thunderbolt served with distinction for over a decade and operated as the main variable fighter of the U.N. Spacy all throughout the 2030`s. Eventually, the VF-11`s lack of missile weaponry and aging design prompted new priorities for the U.N.G. military. In 2040 the VF-11 was scheduled to be replaced pending the winning design of the Super Nova AVF project, a competition between the http://anidb.net/ch48621 [YF-19] and http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21] variable fighters in development since the mid-2030`s. In 2041 the formal decision was made to adopt VF-19 as the next generation of main variable fighters but while the VF-11 would be slowly replaced, the Thunderbolt continued operational deployment in many fleets well into the 2040s.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrossplus/vf-11b.htm</description>

<description>The largest conventional Zentradi warship seen in Space War I, a Nupetiet-Vergnitzs Class vessel was the lead warship of the Bodol Zer Main Fleet`s 67th Glruimual class branch http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] (Adoclass) Fleet. A medium-scale fleet command battleship, the original design for this class of vessel was completed during development competitions in the early years of the Schism War. Over four kilometers in length, these ships are bristling with numerous weapon emplacements and carry a large complement of Zentradi mecha.
http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai Kridanik], the Zentradi in command of the Nupetiet-Vergnitzs, was on a search and destroy mission to find Supervision Army survivors when his fleet came upon residual traces of a Supervision Army gun destroyer`s defold reaction some ten light years away from Earth. The gun destroyer was naturally the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] and http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] led his fleet in an operation to intercept it. When the gun destroyer was found completely reconstructed, http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] led many relentless missions to capture the ship, including a daring operation using his own Nupetiet-Vergnitzs vessel as bait.Though http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai]`s Nupetiet-Vergnitzs was damaged repeatedly during Space War I, the ship remained fully operational during the war and even survived battle against the Bodol Zer Main Fleet. Repaired following the end of the war, the vessel was re-commissioned thereafter and became the first battleship of the New United Nations Forces in December 2012.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/nupetiet-vergnitzs.htm</description>

<description>After the crash-landing of the Alien StarShip-One in July 1999 it is discovered the alien crew was a race of giants some five times the size of a human. Fearful of being unprepared for a conflict with these aliens, the newly formed United Nations Government (UNG) begins researching anti-giant weapon systems technologies. Utilizing the now named OverTechnology found on the ASS-1, the non-variable humanoid mecha called the Destroid is designed; another weapon system is the transformable Battroid. The UNG contracts Stonewell and Bellcom to develop an all-environment variable fighter eventually known as the "Valkyrie." Rising to the challenge, Stonewell and Bellcom subcontract with OT reaction powerplant producer Shinnakasu Heavy Industry and Destroid developer Centinental to complete a basic design by 2005. The first transformable prototype is successfully tested in 2007 and the UNG decides to formally adopt the Valkyrie in November of that year. By late 2008, mass production is in full swing on the VF-1A variable fighter.
From February 2009 to March 2010, the VF-1A Valkyrie served as the standard variable fighter of the U.N. Spacy in Space War I. The VF-1 proved to be an extremely capable craft, successfully combating a variety of Zentradi mecha even in most sorties which saw UN Spacy forces significantly outnumbered. The versatility of the Valkyrie design enabled the variable fighter to act as both large-scale infantry and as air/space superiority fighter. The signature skills of U.N. Spacy ace pilot http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Maximilian Jenius] exemplified the effectiveness of the variable systems as he near-constantly transformed the Valkyrie in battle to seize advantages of each mode as combat conditions changed from moment to moment. The basic VF-1 was deployed in four minor variants (designated A, D, J, and S) and its success was increased by continued development of various enhancements including the GBP-1S "Armored" Valkyrie and FAST Pack "Super" Valkyrie weapon systems.
After the end of Space War I, the VF-1A continued to be manufactured both in the Sol system (notably on the Lunar facility Apollo Base) and throughout the UNG space colonies. Although the VF-1 would eventually be replaced as the primary VF of the UN Spacy by the VF-4 Lightning III in 2020, a long service record and continued production after the war proved the lasting worth of the design. The VF-1A was without doubt the most recognizable variable fighter of Space War I and was seen as a vibrant symbol of the U.N. Spacy even into the first year of the New Era 0001 in 2013. At the end of 2015 the final rollout of the VF-1 was celebrated at a special ceremony, commemorating this most famous of variable fighters.

A number of VF-1D units were also deployed as advanced training variable fighters, for live weapons and full combat functionality instruction. A VF-1D unit designated VT-102 was one such example with the label "Stud Seat" (Student) and "INST CAPT. DAGGER" (Instructor) found upon the exterior of the cockpit (this was the same variable fighter flown by then civilian pilot http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru] in February 2009).

The new head unit of the VF-1J (developed by Kyuusei Industry) features two Mauler RÖV-20 anti-aircraft laser cannons in a slightly improved configuration.

<description>The final of the four minor VF-1 variants, the VF-1S carries the heaviest weapon load of the standard variable fighter.

The VF-1S mounts four of the Mauler series RÖV-20 anti-aircraft laser cannons and enjoys several upgrades in addition to firepower. The engines are improved Shinnakasu Heavy Industry/P&amp;W/Roice FF-2001D models resulting in measurably improved thrust and an enhanced avionics package is featured in each VF-1S. While usually reserved for CAGs (Commander of Air Group), the VF-1S also sometimes finds itself serving as the variable fighter for a squadron leader much like the VF-1J. Captain http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker] piloted a VF-1S during his command of the infamous Skull Squadron.

<name>HWR-00-Mk.II Monster</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>An immense mecha, the Heavy Weight Robot (HWR) Monster Mk II is a heavily armed "land battleship" with a name matching the great size of the destroid. Very shortly after the initial research into the destroids began in 2000 the HWR-00 series began development in December that year. After a lengthy design phase trial production began in October 2005 and the HWR-00 Monster first rollout was in September 2008. The Monster is the largest mobile ground weapon to ever be fielded in battle by mankind, over 41 meters long and weighing almost 300 tons. The Monster was envisioned as a trackless, self-propelled heavy weapon system to be utilized for attack and point defense. In actuality, the Monster`s massive size, poor maneuverability and dedicated long-range weaponry saw the mecha used as a semi-mobile artillery unit best utilized while avoiding uneven ground and any close-range engagement. When put to best use with supporting units in a combined arms role, the Monster is able to field incredible firepower equal to strategic bombing.
The Monster was originally designed to use 50cm linear cannons, but was scaled down with smaller guns when problems arose with system strength and insufficient power for continuous firing. Armed with four 40cm cannons, the Monster can fire a variety of munitions with the primary guns, including anti-armor shells, anti-aircraft munitions, howitzers and even nuclear reaction warheads (OverTechnology reaction warheads have an explosive yield rated at 0.1 kilotons to 50 kilotons). In addition to the main guns, the Mk II features a pair of 3-barreled missile launchers not originally included in the design but incorporated into the two arm units. To compensate for the Monster`s vulnerabilities such as the intense heat emissions of the unit (which prevented effective use of counter measures such as chaff or smoke), the armor was designed to be extremely thick and even capable of withstanding a near hit from a reaction weapon.
Though mass-produced like the other destroids, only two Monster Mk II units were onboard the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] during the outbreak of Space War I. During the conflict, the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] onboard factories made use of equipment for several more Monster mecha and produced a third unit to accompany the original two. Most of the other Monster units were destroyed by orbital bombardment from the Zentradi fleet. The few Monster Mk II units aboard the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] distinguished themselves as very capable war machines during Space War I. While most destroid units suffered heavy losses, the Monsters aboard the ship remained in active service for most of the war and the capability to launch reaction warheads was put to use during the battle with the http://anidb.net/ch17601 [Boddole Zer] Main Fleet in February 2010.

<description>The largest and arguably most devastating Zentradi mecha of Space War I, the Queadluun-Rau battle suits of the female division forces are fast, maneuverable and well-armed mecha. Like the Nousjadeul-Ger of the Zentradi male division forces, the Queadluun-Rau is a powered suit of armor featuring two reaction furnaces that power massive dual engines, propelling the suit at tremendous speeds. A special inertia vector control system gives the Queadluun-Rau unparalled maneuverability and allows efficient atmospheric flight using only vernier thrusters, effectively compensating for the suit`s lack of aerodynamic lift. In battle, the female powered suit relies upon a deadly array of rapid-fire laser and particle cannons, but most lethal of all are the missile launchers. Armed with over a hundred individual short-range missiles, the Queadluun-Rau is capable of engaging dozens of targets, inflicting heavy damage with torrents of guided missile fire.
Most famous of all Queadluun-Rau units in Space War I was the personal mecha of Zentradi ace pilot http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia Fallyna]. Her incredible skills were legendary; http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] was undefeated in her military career up until Space War I. Such was her prowess that her reputation was known even among the Zentradi male divisions, a point of contention for http://anidb.net/ch10516 [Quamzin Kravshera]. Infuriated by http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Millia]`s harsh criticisms of his failures in battle against the forces of the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross], http://anidb.net/ch10516 [Quamzin] cunningly goaded http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] into battle against http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Maximilian Jenius], the ace Valkyrie pilot of the UN Spacy. In her Queadluun-Rau, http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] sought the enemy ace eagerly, but was soundly defeated in battle by http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Jenius] in his http://anidb.net/ch48787 [VF-1A Valkyrie] and barely escaped with her life. It is also notable that another Queadluun-Rau unit was responsible for the attack upon Major http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker]`s http://anidb.net/ch48790 [VF-1S Valkyrie] fighter, the incident which ultimately proved fatal for the veteran ace pilot. Capable of deployment in any environment, the Queadluun-Rau could engage enemy forces in space, in the atmosphere or on the ground. Despite a lack of emphasis upon long-range weaponry, the Queadluun-Rau exceled at medium-to-close range combat and was one of the most versatile and successful Zentradi mecha.
Following the Great Interstellar War (Space War I), the Queadluun-Rau units were employed by the U.N. Forces. Unfortunately, breakdowns in production at the Factory Satellite caused a gradual decrease in operational units. Operational rates were reduced such that by the 2030s the Queadluun-Rau could not be supported by available spare parts. Fortunately, support for reproduction of the Queadluun-Rau remained strong. In 2035, variable fighter design and manufacturing company General Galaxy was entrusted by the U.N. Forces with a modernization and reproduction plan for the Queadluun-Rau.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/queadluun-rau.htm</description>

<description>Already largely organic in appearance, the film version of the Queadluun-Rau underwent only a subtle redsign from the television series. The most notable difference was the change in colors, utlizing the Meltrandi magenta fleet colors for the standard version while http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia]`s unit was colored red (perhaps a subtle historical allegory to Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron of World War I). Aside from the different colors and slight stylistic changes, the Queadluun-Rau was just as deadly in the movie.

<charactertype id="4">Vessel</charactertype>
<description>The Megaroad-01 Class vessel was originally under construction as the SDF-2 Macross Class warship. Construction of the SDF-2 on the Apollo Lunar Base halted late in Space War I and once the war had ended, the New U.N. Government required colonization ships more than warships. When construction resumed in June 2010, the SDF-2 was renamed Megaroad-01 after the Humanity Seeding Project was implemented. Utilizing only the engine block and command control block of the warship, most of the Megaroad does not retain the original look and was newly designed with only minimum armaments and a hull that was not of a strength suitable for battle. At over 1,700 meters in length, the massive Megaroad Class ships were the first mass-produced vessels designed for super-long-distance colonization as part of the Humanity Seeding Project. The Megaroad was designed as the mothership of a large-scale space emigration with emphasis on long-term navigation and living environment capability (effectively utilizing knowledge acquired from operation of the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] Class). The ship`s primary mission is to protect the seeds of humanity through colonization and although the 25,000 complement of the Megaroad is much smaller than the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1] population, prepared supplies for long-term habitation and the residential facilities were both dramatically improved. The first ship Megaroad-01 was launched on September 2012 and two more super-long-distance colonization ships designated Megaroad-02 and Megaroad-03 (based on the Megaroad-01 design) began construction that same month. Thereafter, the UNG would construct one or two super-long-distance colonization ships every year and these colonization fleets would be routinely launched to build settlements on habitable planets throughout the galaxy.
With the Megaroad-01 as flagship, the Super Long Range Emigration Fleet Number One launched on September 2012 with some 25,000 (80,000) colonists aboard the flagship and an escort of Zentradi battlecruisers and U.N. Spacy battleships. The ship was commanded by Major http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Ichijou Misa] and her husband http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru] commanded the http://anidb.net/ch49112 [VF-4 Lightining III] variable fighter squadrons assigned to the Megaroad-01. Along with war hero and idol singer http://anidb.net/ch7418 [Lynn Minmay], the Megaroad-01 departed the Sol System. Sadly, contact with the Megaroad-01 ended four years later in 2016. Although the Super Long Range Emigration Fleet Number One was officially declared lost, the New United Nations Government was nervous about any ill-will directed towards the Seeding Project as a result of the loss. Thus, the New U.N. Government avoided making the Megaroad-01 incident public and instead stated the Megaroad-01 was still continuing on its way. The fate of http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Misa], http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru], http://anidb.net/ch7418 [Minmay] and the crew and colonists of the Megaroad-01 remains a mystery to this day.

<description>The Uraga Class Escort Battle Carrier is the next generation stealth carrier built to replace the Guantánamo Class Stealth Carriers. The Uraga Class, built with weaponry, armor and maneuverability comparable to a cruiser, is often used as the flagship of small fleets. At 550 meters long, the Uraga Class ships are much larger conventional spacecraft but still significantly smaller than the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] or the later New Macross Class ships. The Uraga is built with a stealth composition and features a dual deck launching system for variable fighters; one deck running the latter dorsal two-thirds of the ship and an internal deck underneath with a launching deck in the forward third. This efficient deck design allows rapid deployment of multiple craft simultaneously and has become common on many UN Spacy carrier vessels.
These ships are rare among colonization fleets due to their high costs compared to the http://anidb.net/ch48791 [ARMD] carriers but the UNG remains committed to replacing the older http://anidb.net/ch48791 [ARMD] carriers one by one with Uraga Class vessels. As more Uraga Class Escort Battle Carriers are built, they are poised to become the mainstay combat and carrier ship for the UN Spacy. Many Uraga Class vessels are part of Earth`s defense fleet in 2040 and are found serving as command ships for large groups of Guantánamo Class Stealth Carriers and Stealth Frigates. Several Uraga Class Escort Battle Carriers are also in active service with the 37th Long-Distance Colonization Fleet, serving as defensive stations docked to unarmed core ships such as the Riviera and Hollywood.

<description>In the years following Space War I, the United Nations Government (UNG) quickly rebuilt much of the lost infrastructure and soon the UN Spacy was rebuilding the fleet. Impressed with the initial combat performance and multi-functionality of the http://anidb.net/ch48791 [ARMD] Class Space Carriers, the UN Spacy pursued design and construction of a next generation http://anidb.net/ch48791 [ARMD] Class vessel. The result is the Guantánamo Class Stealth Carrier, an improved space carrier with stealth capabilities and its own Space Fold System for interstellar travel. As a carrier, the Guantánamo Class has a large launch bay in the forward section, a dock in the aft section of the ship (to link with large vessels) and large external fuel tanks with stealth covers. Though this class of vessel utilized many new technologies, the economy of design proved relatively inexpensive and the UN Spacy deployed massive numbers of Guantánamo Stealth Carriers. These ships are found primarily as the main-force carrier in the colonization fleets, but the Guantánamo Class Stealth Carrier is also used extensively for planetary defense. In 2040, Earth has a vast defense fleet stationed in orbit consisting of numerous vessels that included the Guantánamo Class ships as well as thousands of armed defense satellites spread amongst the fleet.

<description>The smallest of the UN Spacy ships of the line, the Northampton Class Stealth Frigate is an easily constructed vessel and functions as the main-force warship for colonization fleets. The main engines are built around the center circumference of the rear hull and supply the 250-meter long frigate with excellent speed and maneuverability that compensates for a lack of heavy firepower. Like many of the next generation space vessels of the UNG, the stealth frigate features a stealth composition and functions as a carrier ship for variable fighters. In battle the stealth frigate utilizes several concealed launch bays for the fighters and has several anti-ship missile launchers and converging energy beam cannons. The widespread use of this class has lead to the deployment of numerous modified Bolognese frigates such as firepower-enhanced, reconnaissance and early-warning variants. The stealth frigates have also been adopted by Zentradi crews and these ships feature more Zentradi technology with distinctive hull designs. The stealth frigate fulfill a primary operational role and thus there are large numbers of these ships serving in the UN Spacy fleets, from planetary defense around Earth to far reaching colony fleets like the 37th long-distance colonization fleet. Stealth Frigates serve as the first defensive line in the emigration fleets, with aircraft carriers forming the second defense line. Additionally, a squadron of stealth frigates will operate as "pilot fish" for surveying routes and securing supplies ahead of a emigration fleet.

<name>VF-17D Nightmare</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>In the mid 2020`s the U.N.G. was already invested in the development of the VF-11 Thunderbolt, but motivation was high for the continuing innovation of new OverTechnology applications in the hopes of building even better variable fighter craft. Ever a company known for pushing the envelope, General Galaxy was contracted by the U.N.G. to build a different type of variable mecha and thus began the development of the VF-17 Nightmare in 2026. While the VF-11 took first flight after only six years of design, the complicated and exacting research of the VF-17 didn`t produce a viable craft until the variable fighter`s first flight 2035. With the success of the flight tests, the U.N. Spacy adopted the VF-17 as a second line variable mecha and included squadrons on many of the colonization fleets, notably the 37th long-distance colonization fleet lead by the 7th Battle Class Stealth Space Attack Carrier in 2038.
The VF-17 Nightmare is a radically different variable fighter than previous generations, featuring completely new wing and transformation systems. Primarily designed as a special operations variable fighter and heavy battroid, the VF-17 is both larger and heavier than most other valkyries and features minimal atmospheric control surfaces subsequent to its primary role as a space fighter. To offset the nearly 12 ton weight, the VF-17 operates two extremely powerful Shinnakasu Heavy Industry/P&amp;W/Roice FF-2100X thermonuclear turbine engines with over twice as much thrust as the VF-11B. These incredibly powerful engines produce enough thrust for the VF-17 to achieve orbit unaided (the first production model variable fighter to do so) while also making the craft an ideal space superiority fighter. In addition to these powerful flight characteristics, the Nightmare is also designed as a stealth mecha and utilizes internally stored weaponry. As was typical following the success of a variable fighter, the VF-17 was eventually fitted with several equipment packages from Radomes and Fold Boosters to customized weaponry and Super Pack systems (though the VF-17 generally avoides the use of Super Parts and external weapons to maintain passive stealth capabilities).
The VF-17 was built in several different versions, but the VF-17D in service during the early 2040`s is the most distinguished model. Notable U.N. Spacy pilot http://anidb.net/ch41155 [Gamlin Kizaki] piloted a VF-17D Nightmare during his service in Macross 7`s elite unit Diamond Force until his promotion to Full Lieutenant when he was assigned a VF-17S. It was originally the intention of the UN Spacy that the VF-17 Nightmare be replaced as the primary special operations fighter of the UN Spacy by the VF-22S Sturmvogel II, also a General Galaxy design. However, by 2050`s the UN Spacy itself would undergo organizational changes as the New UN Spacy (NUNS) and priorities would also change. General Galaxy redesigned the VF-17 Nightmare into the VF-171 Nightmare Plus, a new main fighter/bomber for the New UN Spacy forces (circa 2059).

<description>The colonization of space that began in 2012, though initially beset by misfortune, was proving largely successful for the human race. Mass cloning provided significant population growth and the Megaroad Class ships were regularly carrying colonists to inhabit planets in the far reaches of space. Eventually, the growth of both the population and resources of the United Nations Government (UNG) demanded larger, more sophisticated ships to continue the colonization of space. The New Macross Class Super-Massive Colonization Battleships were designed and constructed. In 2030, the next major colonization fleet departed for the unknown with the first New Macross Class ship in command. With a total fleet population of over one million people, these massive colony fleets would quickly become the standard for the new wave of space colonization in the 2030`s.
The Battle Class Stealth Space Attack Carrier vessels are designed primarily as flagships for super-long-distance colonization fleets. Though armed for heavy anti-ship combat the primary role of the Battle Class is acting as mobile command center and the largest spacecraft/aircraft carrier in the fleet. The powerful main gun is a super beam weapon built as a mobile gunship separable from the ventral hull of the ship. The gunship is built with its own reactor and is capable of independent navigation if required. Like the SDF-1 Macross Class Super Dimension Fortress ships that preceded them, the Battle Class vessels are fully transformable ships that can convert into a humanoid-shaped Attack mode. The main gun is supplemented with four beam cannons but no additional turret weapons or missile launchers are found in most ships of this class. The Battle Class instead carries a large number of over 700 variable fighters, attack craft and bombers that can engage enemy fleets and any enemy attack craft. For rapid deployment of all aerospace craft, the Battle Class has twelve total standard catapults; six on the forward deck, three on the center deck and three on the aft port side angled deck. The ship is also equipped with three additional electromagnetic catapults and a command liaison hatch mounted just forward of the main bridge for immediately launching interceptor-fighters (typically VF-17D Nightmare fighters). For defense, the Battle Class has a pin-point barrier system and a short range full barrier system to defeat incoming enemy fire. In accordance with UN Spacy military doctrine for all ships of the line, the Battle Class has a stealth composition.
The City Class ships are designed as the super-long-distance colonization vessels of the New Macross Class. These ships almost always remained docked to the Battle Class vessels except in time of battle when the carrier will detach from the power plant docking unit mounted at the fore of the City ship. Inside the City Class ships is a fully functional city of roughly 350,000 people beneath the main dome. Outside the main city dome there is docking bay island (approximately 300 meters long) and the event dome. The City ships are powered by a separate reactor and even feature a basic space fold system for short-range interstellar travel. The City Class ships have no weapons and the City ship docked with the first Battle Class, Macross 1, had no defensive system. However, later City Class ships are all designed with a defensive shell that covers the city section of the craft in times of emergency (though both docking bay island and the event domes remain uncovered by the shell).
Perhaps the most distinguished of this ship class is the Macross 7 of the 37th long-distance colonization fleet that took part in the Protodeviln War in 2045. The 37th long-distance colonization fleet consisted of 1 x Battle 7/City 7 (Macross 7), 1 x Einstein Research Experimental Ship, 1 x Hollywood Amusement Ship, 1 x Riviera Resort Ship, 1 x Sunnyflower Agricultural Ship, 1 x Three Star Factory Ship, 1 x West Point Class Macro-Training Base Ship, one or more Mark Twain VII Resort Ships, 45 x Guantánamo Class Stealth Carriers (for use in space), 20 x Uraga Class Escort Battle Carriers (for use in air and space) and lastly 120 x Northampton Class Stealth Frigates (for use in air and space). The ship-carried aircraft/spacecraft for the entire fleet consisted of approximately 1,800 x variable fighters (mostly VF-11C Thunderbolts), 600 x variable attack craft, 9 x variable bombers, 120 x electronic reconnaisance fighters, 60 x cargo plane/freight transports and 100 x liason craft. Total fleet count is 194 large ships and 2,689 small craft. Commanded by Maximillian Jenius, the Battle 7 participated in numerous engagements against the Varauta Army throughout the war. Both the crew of the Battle 7 and the colonists of City 7 worked together during the ProtodevilnWar to develop a highly specialized sound technology that was used by several City 7 citizens to combat the Protodevlin. The infamous variable fighter unit Sound Force was stationed onboard the Macross 7 and the pilots - who together formed the rock band Fire Bomber - lived in the "Akusho" (or Acshio) area, the docking bay island section of City 7.

<description>As the main variable fighter of the U.N. Spacy in 2038, numerous VF-11C Thunderbolts are stationed aboard the 37th long-distance colonization fleet as it is lead by the 7th New Macross class battleship. This version of the Thunderbolt variable fighter features enhanced navigational electronic equipment (this upgrade was eventually installed in all VF-11 fighters from 2040 onward, starting with the first squadron). In 2045 the VF-11C squadrons are deployed in combat regularly since the outbreak of hostilities against the Varauta. Originally the VF-11C benefited from improved safety features which jettisoned the entire cockpit section of the craft in the event of the variable fighter`s destruction. However, this feature has not improved pilot safety in combat against the Varauta and many ejected pilots find themselves subjected to the Spiritia draining weaponry of Varauta mecha. Nonetheless, the VF-11C remains the backbone of the UNS forces for deep space colonization fleets. With hulls painted in bright blue-white, the VF-11C variable fighters of the Macross 7 fleet serve with distinction under command of Captain Maximilian Jenius.

<description>The colony ships that pioneered the great migration into space eventually grew into entire fleets of vessels with populations in excess of a million people. As the size of these colonization fleets increased the time spent traveling through space became a more important consideration for the effect upon the populace. Specialized vessels were built to help fulfill the needs of the colonists who could be traveling to habitable planets for years before settling. The Riviera Resort Ships were designed as vacation vessels, with hotels and casinos for high-class leisure. These large spaceships are over 6 kilometers long and are designed for marine life cultivation and breeding. Underneath a massive transparent dome an artificial 3.6km diameter ocean has been built with a coastline over 10 kilometers long. The forward section includes a large starport for visiting craft and numerous searchlights dot the exterior hull.
As large and important vessels carrying some 100,000 people, the Riviera ships feature defensive options to be used in the event of an emergency. The transparent dome can be covered with an armored shell to protect the population inside and the forward section of the ship is built with a dock to accommodate an Uraga Class Escort Battle Carrier. When the 7th New Macross-Class battleship departed with the 37th long-distance colonization fleet in 2038, a Riviera Resort Ship was among the vessels under its command. The Riviera was also part of the Milky Road inter-ship network which helped ferry small passenger and transport ships in between the vessels of the fleet.

<description>Guvava is a Gyarashi from the planet Pukirases V. He is an intelligent rodent whose fur is so thick he resembles a tribble with eyes. He also has a tail, which he can use to swing and propel himself with, and short legs. Guvava was rescued from his predator-rich environment by Maximilian Jenius in 2036, who found him injured and alone while on a mission. Upon returning home, Max gave him to his youngest daughter, Mylene, to care for. Mylene, then five years old, immediately fell in love with Guvava and helped nurse him back to health. Though Guvava was initially withdrawn, Mylene always stayed close to him, taking him with her almost everywhere, even to school, and the two soon became good friends. Guvava grew to become fiercely devoted to his "mistress" and can often be seen perching on her shoulder. He is telepathically linked to her and can seek her out when they are separated, and understand her speech, though he can only communicate in squeaks. In the presence of danger he rears up, his fur developing angry spikes, and he will even leap to attack if provoked. During Macross 7, set nine years later (in 2045-46), Mylene and Guvava are almost always together, even during concerts and space battles. Mylene states that Guvava is not simply a pet but rather, is a part of herself and she cares for him as much as she does for her human/Zentraedi friends and family.
Despite his small size, Guvava helps to protect Mylene as much as Mylene protects him. In episode 12 of Macross 7, Mylene is kidnapped by infiltration agents of the protodeviln. Guvava uses his telepathic ability to transmit Basara`s music to her and she begins to sing. Guvava is then able to lead Basara and Ray to her location. In Macross Dynamite 7, Mylene is invited to dinner by a woman who works to promote her music. However, the woman secretly drugs Mylene with the intention of sexually molesting her. Guvava immediately runs off to alert Mylene`s friends, Veffidas and Ray, who quickly arrive and smash their way into the room to save Mylene. Ray later states that if it hadn`t been for Guvava, the woman would have likely succeeded in forcing herself on Mylene.

<description>The Fz-109A Elgerzorene is a new variable fighter built by the Varauta from the technology of the UNG. In 2025, the Megaroad-13 colonization fleet found an inhabitable planet in a solar system near the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. The planet system is named Varauta and immigration begins. Almost two decade later in 2043 the Varauta (UNG) research fleet surveys an "ice planet", the fourth planet of the Varauta system, and exploration releases the Protodeviln imprisoned inside. The Protodeviln seize control of the Humans and Zentradi and begin building their own civilization and military. Subsuming the technology of the UNG, the Fz-109A variable fighter is both a combat craft and special operations unit using specialized technology required for Varauta (Protodeviln).
The Fz-109 shares more than an outward design lineage with General Galaxy`s http://anidb.net/ch49570 [VF-14] series heavy fighter-attack craft. The Protodeviln modeled the Fz-109 after the http://anidb.net/ch49570 [VF-14] though the Elgerzorene fighter is built with many different technologies to suit the Varauta. At some 20.08 meters long, the Fz-109 is one of the largest variable fighters in the Protodeviln War but functions as the Varauta mainline fighter craft in nearly every military operation. The most notable outward difference from traditional fighters is the entirely enclosed cockpit canopy of the Fz-109, a canopy that allows no external view. Beneath the canopy is a removable cockpit/escape pod filled with viewing monitors that use the canopy camera eye system for pilot navigation. Like the http://anidb.net/ch49570 [VF-14], the Fz-109 is a space superiority fighter built for optimal performance in a vacuum and carries a large complement of weaponry including missiles, energy guns and projectile gun pods. However, the deadliest of all weapons on the Fz-109 is the Spiritia Absorption Beam system mounted in the head unit of the battroid configuration. It is with this deadly short-range weapon system that the Protodeviln were able to incapacitate pilots of the UN Spacy fighter forces by siphoning life energy, which they called "Spiritia."
In 2045, the Macross 7 Fleet ventures near the planet Varauta and encounters a hostile force of Fz-109 variable fighters. Though larger and heavier than the http://anidb.net/ch49261 [VF-11C Thunderbolt] fighters of the UN Spacy, the Fz-109 is surprisingly nimble in space and the spiritia absorption weapons of the Varauta fighters initially inflict heavy losses on the UN Spacy forces. However, UN Spacy forces adapt quickly after the first encounter and subsequent conflicts between the two forces rarely result in decisive victory for either side. Nonetheless, the Fz-109 variable fighter is able to match even the VF-17 Nightmare and like that space superiority fighter the Fz-109 can achieve satellite orbit unassisted. Until the end of the Protodeviln War in 2046, the Fz-109 remained the mainstay of the Varauta variable fighter forces.

<description>Like the UN Spacy from which their technology derived, the Varauta (Protodeviln) also adopted the military protocols of their enemy. In doing so, the Varauta built specially enhanced versions of their variable fighters for use by team leaders and squadron commanders. A variant designated "F" was built from the standard Fz-109 Elgerzorene heavy variable fighter and fleet leader Gigile pilots one such fighter in his battles against the UN Forces. The Fz-109F variant fighter features an incredible increase in firepower with four additional laser guns, one additional barrel to the rear rapid-fire laser gun placement and two medium-scale missile launcher bays. The "F" variant is also built with more powerful engines that not only compensate for the additional weight, but improve speed beyond the standard Elgerzorene model variable fighter. Gigile` leads the Varauta Army forces in his Fz-109F Elgerzorene, a very distinct sight upon the battlefield in a deep maroon colored hull.

<description>The VF-19 Custom is a remodeled unit that was utilized for preliminary testing preceding the adoption of the mass production model VF-19 Excalibur. A goal of the VF-19 Custom was emphasis on maneuverability and stability in contrast to that of the original YF-19 prototype. The VF-19 Custom featured a modified version of the prototype fuselage that balance the high performance inherited from the original unit. The VF-19 aimed to improve the balance by reworking the fuselage structure, but the VF-19 Custom daringly maintains high maneuverability by following the original YF-19 concept. However, it was "singing" that characterized the principal objective of the VF-19 Custom far more than the outstanding operating performance. The craft was entrusted to Basara Nekki of the rock group "Fire Bomber" through Ray Lovelock. Granting operation of the VF-19 Custom to Basara and Lovelock was for the purpose of verifying application of the craft to the top-secret military program "Project M", aimed researching song energy. On the battlefield the VF-19 Custom would bask in the media limelight. Behind the scenes, the military operated data collection on the VF-19 Custom and the craft was supported by the military via thorough maintenance.
On board the Macross 7 fleet in 2045, a special paramilitary unit made use of a customized VF-19 variable fighter with a bright red colored hull. This VF-19 Custom was built by the UN Forces and given to Ray Lovelock as part of Operation M, a classified mission to test the combat effects of culture via music upon a potential enemy. The unduly decorative design matches the brashness and audacity of Nekki Basara, the singer/pilot assigned to the VF-19 by Lovelock. The VF-19 Custom features minimal offensive weaponry and is armed with only a pair of laser cannons (mounted in the wing roots) and two internal missile launch systems (mounted in the engines/lower legs). The primary armament of the VF-19 Custom is an external speaker-pod-firing launcher pod with sensor, fore grip and stock magazine (mounted on ventral fuselage section in Fighter mode or in manipulator in GERWALK and Battroid mode). The shoulders/dorsal engine nacelles have installed audio and speaker systems as well as lightup projector systems. With the launcher pod and sound systems, Basara fires armor-penetrating speaker-pods into enemy mecha and directly transmits his music to the enemy pilots inside. For defense, the VF-19 Custom features a pin-point barrier system like all VF-19 variable fighters. The cockpit of the VF-19 Custom is redesigned to utilize a non-conventional control stick resembling a guitar, an instrument that singer/pilot Nekki Basara manipulates skillfully to operate the myriad controls of the variable fighter in combat.
The VF-19 Custom was originally intended as a first strike weapon for use against non-cultured Zentradi still engaged in hostilities across the galaxy with the Supervision Army. With this variable fighter, the UN Forces could directly assault and confuse the Zentradi forces by exposing them to culture through music, a completely foreign experience that proved very disruptive to their strictly military life. However, the VF-19 Custom and Nekki Basara in particular played a much larger role during the Protodeviln War in 2045. The Varauta Army consisted largely of brainwashed humans and Zentradi of Earth origin as well as Protodeviln possessing humans directly. The Protodeviln and their Varauta Army were vulnerable to particularly high intensity sound energy produced by certain individuals via life energy called Spiritia. These individuals, like Nekki Basara, were known as Anima Spiritia to the Protodeviln and greatly feared. When Sound Force was established, the spiritia of Basara and his band Fire Bomber were transmitted to the enemy via the Sound Energy Converter and Sound Booster technologies. These systems proved very effective in combating not only the Protodeviln themselves, but also in hampering function of the Varauata Army`s technology.

<description>The VF-17S is a variant to the standard Nightmare variable fighter featuring increased firepower and more powerful engines. It has become accepted practice in the UN Spacy to assign slightly modified variable fighters to team leaders and command officers so the VF-17S was built in line with that operational policy. Featuring a new head unit with one extra sensor installed, firepower is improved with four anti-aircraft laser guns rather than just a single pair of guns. The VF-17S is also designed with two Shinnakasu Heavy Industry/P&amp;W/Roice FF-2100X Custom thermonuclear turbine engines that provide an additional 9,000 kg [x g] of thrust. Diamond Force commander Lt. http://anidb.net/ch43638 [Kinryuu] piloted a VF-17S with a yellow highlighted hull while serving aboard the Macross 7 in 2045.

While only some 366 meters long, the Space Cruiser possesses 12 beam guns, 18 anti-ship missiles and over a dozen variable fighters granting the ship a large degree of firepower for such a small vessel. To assist in the fast attack role, the Space Cruiser has upgraded conventional engine thrust, improved maneuverability and higher fold engine power enabling the ship to arrive in a combat zone quickly, strike quickly and retreat quickly. Both armor and firepower are strongest in the forward sections of the ship; a design which aids the Space Cruiser in raids, disturbances and armed assault missions.

In December of 2045, the Einstein became very active after the discovery of Protoculture Ruins on the planet Rax. The extensive facilities aided the UN Forces as they examined all information gathered from the Protoculture temple. Advisor Exedol was a key figure in researching data gathered about the Protoculture and the Protoculture connection to the Protodeviln. All this research was conducted on the research ship and Exedol remained aboard the Einstein up until the end of the Protodeviln War in 2046.

<description>Distinguished in a colored hull of green and grey, the Standard Battleline Battleship is the primary capital warship of the Varauta forces. The Battleline Battleship features heavy weapons and armor for intense ship-to-ship combat as well as docking facilities for numerous variable fighters. The forward half of the Battleline Battleship is constructed with many slot-based sections that can extend and retract. The dorsal slot sections are equipped with catapults, each capable of launching four stowed variable fighters on it`s upper deck. The ventral slot sections feature anti-ship missile launchers. UNS analysts have suggested the Standard Batteline Battleship has an obvious design lineage to both UN Spacy and Zentradi technology. In particular, the green and grey hull is colored very similar to Zentradi warships and is fairly supple in design. The overall function of the Standard Battleship seems to follow that of the http://anidb.net/ch49233 [Guantanamo Class Stealth Carrier] featuring a similar hull shape and prominent forward launching port.

<description>The City Class ships are designed as the super-long-distance colonization vessels of the New Macross Class. These ships almost always remained docked to the Battle Class vessels except in time of battle when the carrier will detach from the power plant docking unit mounted at the fore of the City ship. Inside the City Class ships is a fully functional city of roughly 350,000 people beneath the main dome. Outside the main city dome there is docking bay island (approximately 300 meters long) and the event dome. The City ships are powered by a separate reactor and even feature a basic space fold system for short-range interstellar travel. The City Class ships have no weapons and the City ship docked with the first Battle Class, Macross 1, had no defensive system. However, later City Class ships are all designed with a defensive shell that covers the city section of the craft in times of emergency (though both docking bay island and the event domes remain uncovered by the shell).

<description>With each new class of variable fighter the UN Spacy has found it useful to assign modified variants to team leaders and flight commanders. The VF-19S is a variant built in line with that official doctrine and features several improvements from the standard Excalibur model. A new head unit was built to replace the standard "F" series model, but in addition to the standard central beam gun the VF-19S features four additional fixed anti-aircraft laser cannons mounted on the sides of the head turret. The VF-19S weighs slightly more than the standard model Excalibur (8.62 metric tons) but more than offsets the little additional weight with significantly improved engines. Two Shinsei Industry/P&amp;W/Roice FF-2550J engines provide the VF-19S with 12,900 kg [x g] more thrust. The VF-19S, like the VF-19F, appears in standard blue mass production colors but the "S" model includes gold highlights unlike the "F" model silver highlights. Second Lieutenant http://anidb.net/ch43874 [Docker] of Emerald Force was noted for flying a VF-19S during the Protodeviln War in 2045-2046.

<description>Following Space War I the significant number of Zentradi survivors became a driving force within the new United Nations Government. Since the UN Spacy fleet was almost completely destroyed after Space War I, the 100 remaining Zentradi spaceships of the Adoclass fleet became the bulk of the UNG`s space fleet forces and http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai]`s command ship became the first battleship of the new UN Forces. The Zentradi, long familiar with using their own technology but lacking technical skills, were taught to understand and create technology of their own as they became assimilated into human culture. Zentradi OverTechnology remained common throughout the UNG colonies even decades later and it became standard practice for many Zentradi to create their own variants of existing UNG variable fighter and ship designs. In the 2030s, the Zentradi built Stealth Frigates with variations specific to Zentradi crews. The ships featured the recognizable green colors common to older Zentradi spaceships and the smooth, organic style became pronounced in all Zentradi variant hull designs. The Frigate retained a stealth composition in the Zentradi variant and was built with Zentradi engines, fold drives and gravity control systems. Many of these Zentradi Stealth Frigates served in the ill-fated Macross 5 fleet.

<description>Launched sometime in the 2030s, the Macross 5 was the fifth New Macross Class vessel built by the UNG and the 35th long-distance immigration fleet. Unlike other ships of the class, the Battle 5 was constructed by Zentradi and designed with Zentradi technology. Thus the ship looks much smoother and more organic in style than comparable UN Spacy ships of the line. The Battle 5 contained Zentradi colonists in miclone form and the large fleet consisted of two other Macross-like ships in addition to Three Star Factory Ships, Stealth Frigates (Zentradi Variant) and Neo Nupetiet-Vergnitzs Class Fleet Command Battleships. The Macross 5 and Macross 7 share similar feautres since both structures were designed by General Galaxy.In early September 2045 the Macross 5 fleet landed upon the habitable planet Rax and began initial preparations for colonization. They contacted the nearby Macross 7 fleet to extend an invitation to visit the new colony world and hoped that the band Fire Bomber would make an appearance due to their popularity among the fleet. When the Macross 7 and it`s fleet arrived in September 2045, the Macross 5 fleet was found destroyed and the colony annihilated. Most of the colonists had been taken captive by the Protodeviln and eventually mind controlled to fill the ranks of the Varauta military.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/newmacross5.htm</description>

<description>The Nupetiet-Vergnitzs Class Fleet Command Battleship was a distinguished vessel in the UNG military post-Space War I. http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai Kridanik], formerly commander of the Zentradi Adoclass Fleet, had become a high ranking leader in the UNG military and his Nupetiet-Vergnitzs had been officially christened as the first battleship of the New UN Forces in December 2012. The Nupetiet-Vergnitzs class, following a minor refit in 2012, underwent a complete refit and redesign with additional Earth technology. The class was designated the Neo Nupetiet-Vergnitzs bis and the hull was completely rebuilt to bring the ship in line with the new motif of the modern UNG fleet. Two external dorsal bridges (one to the fore and one to the aft) were added and additional antennae were built including two main dorsal antennae aft of the bridge and one main ventral antenna. These ships served in colonization fleets in 2040s. One Neo Nupetiet-Vergnitzs Class was part of the Macross 5 fleet that was completely destroyed by the Varauta on the planet Rax in September 2045.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/neo-nupetiet-vergnitzs.htm</description>

<description>The VF-11MAXL Custom was the third variable fighter modified by the Macross 7 Special Technologies Group for deployment in Sound Force. The paramilitary unit consists of civilian singers/pilots from the rock band http://anidb.net/ch49391 [Fire Bomber] utilizing modified valkyries to use Sound Energy against the Varauta Army of the Protodeviln. http://anidb.net/ch14046 [Mylene Flare Jenius] is assigned the VF-11MAXL Custom modified with a unique guitar sound stick control mounted on gimbal-and-joint system with throttle and options control on slider for HOTAS control. Piloting this variable fighter http://anidb.net/ch14046 [Mylene] participated in numerous sorties against Varauta forces along with http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Nekki Basara] in the http://anidb.net/ch49268 [VF-19 Custom] and http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Ray Lovelock] and http://anidb.net/ch14970 [Veffidas Feaze] in the http://anidb.net/ch49490 [VF-17T Custom].
The VF-11MAXL Custom is lightly armed, like most of the variable fighters modified for use in the Sound Force unit. The head cannon and gun pod were removed, leaving only four missile launchers in the dorsal/shoulder sections, two internal engine/leg launchers and two laser cannons. The primary weapon is a speaker-pod-firing launcher pod mounted on the ventral fuselage in fighter mode or in the manipulator in GERWALK and Battroid modes. http://anidb.net/ch14046 [Mylene] uses this weapon to fire speaker pods into enemy mecha and transmit sound energy directly to the enemy pilots. The variable fighter is also equipped with a high performance audio system and speaker system (speaker units mounted nose in Fighter and GERWALK modes or front torsoin Battroid mode) and a lightup projector system. The VF-11MAXL has also been modified with enhanced engines and more powerful vernier thrusters for faster performance and greater maneuverability.

<description>http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Ray Lovelock] was approached by the UN Forces to once again serve in the military after his retirement under distressing circumstances. http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Ray] accepted the unique proposal and became involved in Operation M, commanded by Macross 7 Captain http://anidb.net/ch41156 [Maximillian Jenius]. Originally involving only two members (http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Lovelock] himself and http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Nekki Basara]) the initial mandate of Operation M involved the deployment of only one customized VF-19 variable fighter, piloted by http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Basara]. Later in 2045, the paramilitary unit Sound Force was established and http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Ray Lovelock] was assigned to his own variable fighter, a custom VF-17T valkyrie. The Special Technologies Group onboard the Macross 7 extensively modified a two-seater VF-17T with an internal sound system and more powerful engines. http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Ray Lovelock] would pilot this VF-17T Custom into combat along side Sound Force, with http://anidb.net/ch14970 [Veffidas Feaze] as copilot.
The VF-17T Custom is primarily deployed as a Sound Energy variable fighter. The VF-17T Custom is not a direct combat unit (similar to the http://anidb.net/ch49268 [VF-19 Custom]) and as such carries only two laser cannons and four micro-missile launchers for emergency use only. The primary offensive weapon is a speaker-pod-shooting launcher pod (mounted with exit port in ventral fuselage/lower legs, ejecting from lower leg section into manipulator for Heavy Battroid mode). These armor-penetrating speaker pods can pierce through the hull of enemy mecha and transmit audio from the Sound Energy Converting system oboard the VF-17T Custom directly to the enemy pilots. http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Ray Lovelock] and http://anidb.net/ch14970 [Veffidas Feaze], as part of the rock music band http://anidb.net/ch49391 [Fire Bomber], participated in numerous sorties with the Sound Force unit.

<name>VF-19F Excalibur</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>The "VF-19 Excalibur" is the production version of the http://anidb.net/ch48621 [YF-19] variable fighter (winning design of the Project Super Nova AVF competition) and is the next generation main variable fighter used by the U.N. Spacy in the 2040s. In 2041, the decision was made to adopt the VF-19 as the next generation main fighter of the UN Forces. The initial VF-19A production model is virtually identical to the YF-19 but rather than the sand colored hull of the prototype, the first production model features a blue and white colored hull. The VF-19 is also built with newly designed head units for both the F and S model variants.
As mass production continued the structure of the VF-19 was redesigned for both the F and S models. The dorsal fuselage (forward of the engine nacelles; the shoulders in Battroid mode) is enlarged and reshaped. The engine nozzles (lower legs in Battroid mode) were also redesigned with two encircling vernier slits. In addition to these design alterations, the two vertical stabilizers were placed farther outward on the dorsal fuselage to merge with the main wings and the central dorsal fuselage was reduced in size (which becomes a smaller anti-projectile shield in Battroid mode). The forward canard wing was removed and replaced with high maneuverability vernier thrusters and the main wing was also redesigned with a much smaller surface area. The fighter form of the http://anidb.net/ch48621 [YF-19] boasted astounding maneuverability performance but had a fatal decrease in maneuverability control. The VF-19 aimed to improve the balance by reworking the fuselage structure, but the http://anidb.net/ch49268 [VF-19 Custom] daringly maintains high maneuverability by following the original http://anidb.net/ch48621 [YF-19] concept. Other differences from the http://anidb.net/ch48621 [YF-19] prototype can be found in both "F-type" and "S-type" Excaliburs, such as replaced engines with more stable output and a simplified airframe body. These changes found in the VF-19 Excalibur create a comprehensive performance that not only allow average pilots to control the craft but also exceed the prototype unit.
A new unit, designated as Emerald Force, was established onboard the http://anidb.net/ch49255 [Macross 7] in 2045. The pilots of Emerald Force operated the newest VF-19F and http://anidb.net/ch49456 [VF-19S] fighters in the 37th long-distance colonization fleet. Lt. http://anidb.net/ch43874 [Docker] was the first Macross 7 pilot to fly the http://anidb.net/ch49456 [VF-19S] and was placed in command of Emerald Force. The VF-19 Excalibur was deployed continuously in combat during the Protodeviln War.

He can also fire intense energy beams that surpass by far the Macross Cannon in power. His face can also redirect laser fire. He increases in size when he absorbs spiritia—which he can drain from lower life forms such as humans and Zentradi and even cause massive dehydration, but the energy of Anima Spiritia causes him to shrink, and after several encounters he flees instinctively from it. Lacking any discernible intelligence of his own, he is frequently given instructions by http://anidb.net/ch43863 [Gavil], the other half of an even more powerful being.

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>The Az-130 Panzerzorene is another Varauta-built variable fighter designed after obtaining UNS technology. When UN Forces investigated the fourth planet of the Varauta system and fell victim to the Protodeviln, the UNS VA-14 variable fighters were taken by the Varauta and redesigned for their needs. Like all adapted Varauta fighters the Az-130 is a heavy variable vehicle armed with five fixed weapons, two gun pods and six missile launchers. When deployed together the Az-130 can launch devastating attacks firing dozens of missiles each to launch massive fusillades against the enemy. The Panzerzorene is also equipped with a spiritia absorption beam mounted on the right side of the head unit in Battroid mode. The heavy firepower and strong armor of the Panzerzorene is a significant advantage for the variable fighter when in battle against lighter enemy units. However, as a larger variable vehicle some 15.5 metric tons in weight the Az-130 is slower to accelerate and less maneuverable the UNS variable fighters.
The Az-130A standard model variable fighter entered service later in the Protodeviln War along side the http://anidb.net/ch49550 [FBz-99 Saubergeran] in November 2045. The Az-130 squadrons were operated by captured Zentradi pilots from the Macross 5 fleet and forced to fight under the mind control technology of the Protodeviln.

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>Two years prior to the Protodevlin War the Varauta, true to their parasitic nature, acquired the technology of the UN Spacy that explored the Varauta solar system and built new variable fighters based upon these stolen spacecraft. The FBz-99 Saubergeran is a design modeled after the UN Forces VAB-2D variable fighter-bomber developed by Northrom &amp; Grumman/Mikoyan. The Saubergeran is a very large variable fighter-bomber with a wingspan of nearly 38 meters and weighs 22.6 metric tons. The FBz-99 features numerous missiles in six separate launchers with an additional six hard points which can altogether accommodate in excess of 60 tons of ordnance. Though functioning as a bomber, the Saubergeran is also a variable fighter armed with two pulse guns in each lower arm and four anti-air beam guns mounted on the dorsal fuselage/shoulders. The missile launchers make the Saubergeran an incredibly dangerous variable fighter, capable of not only launching dozens of missiles simultaneously, but able to repeat this attack with a large supply of ordnance. The Heavy Battroid mode of the FBz-99, a huge Battroid over 22 meters tall, is very robust and can be difficult to damage quickly in battle without using heavy weapons. Unfortunately because of its size and weight, the Saubergeran is not as fast or maneuverable as other variable fighters. However the FBz-99G has four powerful engines (and two additional nozzles for Battroid mode) and can achieve orbit unaided. The FBz-99G also made use of a Sound Wave neutralization countermeasure that helped harden the fighter and provided some protection for the pilot against the Sound Energy of Sound Force. The Saubergeran was also equipped with a spiritia spark gun capable of draining spiritia and also reinforcing mental control of Varauta pilots subjected to the Sound Force attack.
The FBz-99G Saubergeran was the model first deployed during the Protodevlin War in November 2045. The Protodevlin http://anidb.net/ch43863 [Gavil] piloted this monstrous variable weapon into combat against the UN Forces of the 37th long-distance colonization fleet. Unfortunately for http://anidb.net/ch43863 [Gavil], the UN Spacy pilot http://anidb.net/ch41155 [Gamlin] was coming into his own as an accomplished ace pilot and flying in his http://anidb.net/ch49269 [VF-17S Nightmare] (armed with a powerful beam gun adaptor), http://anidb.net/ch41155 [Gamlin] repeatedly shot down http://anidb.net/ch43863 [Gavil]`s Saubergeran fighter-bomber in one engagement after another.

<description>Despite initial misgivings the UN Forces were forced to admit that Sound Force did have a legitimate effect upon the enemy, however uneven and unpredictable the result. As such, the UN Forces decided to expand the initial mandate of Operation M and create more units using sound technology. The units were called "Jamming Birds" and comprised VF-11D Custom variable fighters built by Macross 7 Project M Special Technologies Group. One lot of 20 craft was produced and flown by trained UN Spacy pilots along with a co-pilot performer who could utilize the sound technology system. Auditions were held for Jamming Bird hopefuls and a final selection of six singers and musicians provided the UN Forces with their first new recruits.
The Jamming Birds, unlike Sound Force, were a strictly regimented military unit and the VF-11D Custom variable fighters were fully armed combat craft. The VF-11D Custom is built with a special two-seat cockpit, a secondary transparent spherical canopy for the rear seat and retractable four-piece canopy cover for Battroid mode. The Jamming Bird also features a newly designed head unit with a visor-style main sensor. The most important modifications made to the VF-11D Custom are the sound energy converter system and the Sound Boosters. The added equipment and accommodation made the VF-11D heavier than the standard http://anidb.net/ch49261 [VF-11C]. To compensate for the additional weight, the VF-11D Custom featured enhanced engines for additional thrust, VF-19 model vernier thrusters and enlarged canard wings for better maneuverability. The Super Part Boosters enable the VF-11D Custom to achieve orbit and can be utilized both in the atmosphere and in space.
The first deployment of the VF-11D Jamming Birds in November 2045 was a complete failure. While the VF-11Ds and the sound energy systems were combat worthy hardware, the UN Forces failed to account for the human element of the assigned personnel. Unlike http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Nekki Basara] and http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Ray Lovelock] who had military flight experience and natural ability (and, to a lesser degree, http://anidb.net/ch14046 [Mylene Jenius]), the singers/musicians of the Jamming Birds fared poorly under combat conditions, unable to sing effectively due to both the emotional and physical stresses of variable fighter combat. Colonel http://anidb.net/ch44100 [Barton], the officer in charge of the Jamming Bird unit, refused to admit failure and continued with a training program for the civilian personnel. The Jamming Birds eventually became an effective fighting force against the Varauta, but only at the final stage of the Protodeviln War.

<description>In the era following the launch of the Megaroad-01 in 2012, the UNG decided to abandon the larger, heavier variable vehicles like the http://anidb.net/ch49112 [VF-4 Lightning III] in favor of a move toward lighter and more advanced variable fighters such as the VF-5000 Star Mirage and the VF-11 Thunderbolt. However, development resources and military needs were such that building other variable fighters remained a necessity. Beginning in 2025, General Galaxy/Messer began development of the VF-14 Vampire based on Stonewell Bellcom`s http://anidb.net/ch49112 [VF-4 Lightning III] and incorporating Zentradi technology into conventional OverTechnology. First flight took place in 2027 and mass production began in 2028. By 2030, the VF-14 had entered active service and during the peak of deployment the Vampire served as main variable fighter on colonization, survey and other fleets. Though the design has been succeeded by next generation variable fighters, the VF-14 Vampire continues production under license at various colonies and other locations. The VF-14 was a fighter design in the "Nova Project" competition but lost to the VF-11 Thunderbolt as the variable fighter to replace the http://anidb.net/ch49112 [VF-4 Lightning III] as the next main fighter. However, the Vampire was found useful on frontier immigration planets and emigrant fleets because it excelled in cruising performance in space and its airframe was easy to maintain. These factors lead to mass production of the VF-14 Vampire.

<description>Of the seven central ships in the 37th long-distance colonization fleet (http://anidb.net/ch49377 [Einstein] Research Experimental Ship, http://anidb.net/ch49408 [Hollywood] Amusement Ship, http://anidb.net/ch49351 [Mark Twain] Resort Ship, http://anidb.net/ch49262 [Riviera] Resort Ship, http://anidb.net/ch49273 [Sunny Flower] Agricultural Ship, and http://anidb.net/ch49341 [Three Star] Factory Ship) the West Point Class Macro-Training Base Ship is the only military vessel of the group. As the name implies, the West Point Class is a training ship and is equipped with numerous military facilities such as flight simulators for pilot training. In addition to training, the Begin Hill acts as a frontline command center for the fleet (in the absence of the http://anidb.net/ch49255 [Macross 7]) and also supports the fleet by replenishing supplies and developing weapons.

<description>The "true form" of http://anidb.net/ch43863 [Gavil] and http://anidb.net/ch49520 [Glavil], Gavigla is a mighty Protodeviln which combines the intelligence of one with the might and power of the other. He can produce energy waves which radiate outwards, destroying all in their path, as well as attacking in more conventional ways, crushing anything in his paws. He can easily survive a blast from the Macross Cannon, and the energy of Anima Spiritia has no apparent effect on him.

<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>In March 2040 the Project Super Nova Advanced Variable Fighter (AVF) competition ended disastrously for General Galaxy with the complete destruction of their second http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21] prototype variable fighter in the "Sharon Apple Incident". The UNG military decided to adopt the http://anidb.net/ch48621 [YF-19] design from Shinsei Industries and mass production of the VF-19 commenced as the new main variable fighter of the UN Forces. General Galaxy however bravely continued onward with their development of the http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21] and redesigned the brainwave control system so that it was not the primary control system of the craft. The active stealth capabilities and payload abilities of the http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21] were evaluated and General Galaxy produced the VF-22 Sturmvogel II as a special operations Valkyrie built in small numbers. It was a successful gamble for General Galaxy and in December 2042 the decision was made to formerly adopt the VF-22 Sturmvogel II as a special operations variable fighter.
The VF-22 Sturmvogel II retained many of the advanced technologies in the http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21] prototype fighter. The brainwave control system BDI (Brain Direct Image), the main improvement from the http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21], was significantly simplified and worked in conjunction with a primary manual operating system within a corresponding cockpit. Simplification of the BDI system reduced the enormous cost of the unit and the weight of the equipment. The cockpit is also redesigned with an overhead spherical canopy offering superior visibility in Fighter and GERWALK configurations. In Battroid mode the forward interior canopy is built with a large partial sphere monitor providing a 180 degree view forward. All three laser cannons on the http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21] prototype were replaced with converging energy beam guns for the VF-22 but the production model retains the four dorsal missile launchers (in addition to 4 ventral ports) and large missile ordnance stowed in three internal pallets. As a further refinement the VF-22 features two sensor units (one mounted to the rear) in a newly configured head unit as opposed to the five sensors found on the old http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21]. The VF-22 is also armed with two gatling gun pods with retractable stealth covers and includes a pin-point barrier defensive system.
The first VF-22S fighters were manufactured by the Macross 7 fleet Three Star Factory Ship under experimental license. Two fighters were produced and flown by http://anidb.net/ch41156 [Max] and http://anidb.net/ch41157 [Milia Jenius] in the final stages of the Protodeviln War in February 2046.
BDI system functions as a sub-system, assisting in weapons control, chaff, or smoke during air-combat maneuvers where high G`s are required
BDI system for assistance; engine block remains on main body in GERWALK and Battroid modes, enabling effcient use of main engine thrust and providing high mobility compared to past VFs.
