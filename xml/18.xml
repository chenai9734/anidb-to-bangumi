<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="268494">Classic fun anime :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="350281">A great parody of 70`s-80`s space operas, yet with consistently high quality. Worth every minute.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="361895">Funny at hell from the beginning to the early end , very interesting characters &amp; realistic emotion developments , promising comedic LoGH-style background , a little bit sweet harem - What more can you ask for ? Well IF ONLY they gave it a proper ending . The ending is just a serious WTF that ruined the whole series without solve ANYTHING at all .</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="266621">Now that`s an enjoyable and relaxing ride of an anime, completely unlike the usual comedy crap. At last a worthy comedy-parody that can be seen without losing interest at all times, and from all tastes too. It truly shows elements of war, army and space operas in the most ridiculous ways ever seen. Funny and absurd as hell at times, and even serious with a decent plot later on, this is a great, funny and unique space opera work, that more people should definitely check out.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="124887">It`s a great anime series. Must see it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="339649">One of the very few comedies I`ve ever really enjoyed.
An awesome anime -- and a great comedy / parody.
A true gem of the past ;)</recommendation>

<description>Seeking to find the most comfortable living possible, http://anidb.net/ch7034 [Justy Ueki Tylor] stumbles upon what he thinks is a dream career: delivering pension checks for the United Planets Space Force (whose logo looks suspiciously like a giant tomato). Through his sheer luck (which at times borders the unbelievable), he goes from utter layabout to hero in charge of the good ship Soyokaze... oh, wait, did we call it a good ship? The Soyokaze, to put it bluntly, is the disgrace of the UPSF, and a dumping ground for the dregs of the universe. Even so, Tylor remains undaunted... after all, why should he care? He`s only the captain, after all...

<name>artificial intelligence</name>
<description>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science that aims to create it. AI textbooks define the field as "the study and design of intelligent agents" where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success. John McCarthy, who coined the term in 1956, defines it as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines."
The field was founded on the claim that a central property of humans, intelligence—the sapience of Homo sapiens—can be so precisely described that it can be simulated by a machine. This raises philosophical issues about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings, issues which have been addressed by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity. Artificial intelligence has been the subject of optimism, but has also suffered setbacks and, today, has become an essential part of the technology industry, providing the heavy lifting for many of the most difficult problems in computer science.
AI research is highly technical and specialized, and deeply divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other. Subfields have grown up around particular institutions, the work of individual researchers, the solution of specific problems, longstanding differences of opinion about how AI should be done and the application of widely differing tools. The central problems of AI include such traits as reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, communication, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence (or "strong AI") is still among the field`s long term goals.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<description>Mecha in Japanese basically means mechanical things; everything from an electric whisk or a car to a spaceship or a robot.

<description>Space Travel usually refers going to space or travelling there with or without a spacecraft. There are different forms of space travel like Interplanetary travel, Interstellar travel or Intergalactic travel. Since it isn`t possible to travel faster than light, most anime series involve some sort "sub-space travel mechanism" as a way to travel faster than light.</description>

<description>Power Suits are similar to Piloted Robots which are controlled from inside the robot except that Power Suits tend to be more directly tied to how the character moves and they are usually not as big as Piloted Robots can be.

<name>violent retribution for accidental infringement</name>
<description>A comedy / slapstick element often found in Ecchi anime: The hilarity derives from spontaneous embarrassment, overreaction of the "victim" (girl), immediate retribution for a seemingly inappropriate act, and a sense of pity with the supposed "aggressor" (boy).
Typically a boy will - through no fault of his own - stumble into a girl, thus invading her personal space. In the process the boy may e.g. pull down her skirt, grab the girl`s breasts, or accidentally kiss her. Any level-headed girl would see the accident just for what it is. Not so the girl with an overly developed sense of modesty, and a thing for violence. She - often a tsundere - will clobber the boy with excessive brutality.</description>

<name>alcohol</name>
<description>Alcohol (or more scientifically, ethanol), is one of the world`s oldest psychoactive substances. It is traditionally found in the form of a beverage such as beer, wine, or liquor, although in some contexts it can be inhaled to produce similar or intoxication, and some people prefer another way of consuming beverage-form alcohol.
Alcoholic beverages are many and varied, due to production methods (fermentation or distillation), source materials (grains, fruits, vegetables, other plants), added substances such as flavorings, and many more ways of defining different forms of alcoholic beverages.
Alcoholic beverages are divided into three general classes: beers, wines, and spirits. They are legally consumed in most countries, and over 100 countries have laws regulating their production, sale, and consumption. In particular, such laws specify the minimum age at which a person may legally buy or drink them. This minimum age varies between 16 and 25 years, depending upon the country and the type of drink. Most nations set it at 18 years of age.</description>

<description>The difference between space and ocean is marginal. In fact the two are completely interchangeable. Spacecraft are usually called ships and space forces use naval ranks. Movement in space is two-dimensional. There is friction. And not to forget space pirates are roaming through the galaxy and just so often you will encounter space whales.
Some titles take this even a step further by actually displaying the space as a sort of gigantic liquid mass.</description>

Space opera generally involves large-scale conflicts between opponents with powerful abilities and technology. The genre will often be melodramatic, sometimes playing music that can be nothing short of awesome. Warfare and a battle of wits are usually less emphasized, preferring romance (with exceptions, e.g. Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu). Some space operas tend to be formulaic and sometimes even prosaic, often employing very simple devices and somewhat obvious strategies. An example of this would be the infamous laws of physics in the Macross universe, in which the main male lead will hardly ever get hit in battle.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The 16-year-old empress of the Holy Raalgon Empire. Azalyn is a child, forced into the unenviable situation of having to assume power of the empire once her parents are murdered. Prompted by her advisors, she gives the command to attack the UPSF (assuming that they were behind the assassination plot). Having not had a chance to be a child, Azalyn must now be strong for the entire empire, and it`s a task that she is afraid of taking, but even more afraid of failing.</description>

<description>Lt. Commander Yuriko Star is another by-the-book officer. Yuriko joined the UPSF to give her life structure and attepts to obey the rules in almost every situation. However, she, unlike http://anidb.net/ch7036 [Yamamoto], has no problem telling http://anidb.net/ch7034 [Tylor] that he has done something wrong and will even resort to slapping him when he gets too far out of line. Yuriko also tries to downplay her gender, making herself a soldier first, and then a woman. This is a sore subject for her when someone comments about Tylor`s obvious attraction to her looks, pointing out that she has never used her appearance to get ahead; an equally sore point for her is her budding attraction to him. Yuriko is one of the most rational and level-headed officers on the http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze]. While she is senior to Yamamoto, her speciality as an intelligence officer places her outside the chain of command.</description>

<description>Justy Ueki Tylor joins the United Planets Space Force hoping for an easy ride through life but with the devil`s luck becomes a hero. He is soon promoted Lieutenant Commander and Captain of http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze]. Tylor is a irresponsible laid back captain that can always find his way out of trouble unscathed. Tylor normally allows his crew to "bend" the rules such as letting the surgeon drink while on duty. Throughout the ranks it is argued that Tylor is either the most brilliant military mind or just a lucky bafoon.</description>

Her hobbies include shopping and modern dance. She likes to read a women`s magazine called "Enen" in her free time, but is absolutely professional where her job is concerned.
She is cool-headed in a crisis and extremely skilled as a communications officer. She says at one point that she transfered onto the Soyokaze in order to find direction in her life, and there`s the strong possibility she did it after breaking up with a man.</description>

<description>Lieutenant Makoto Yamamoto is another very strait-laced, by-the-books military man. Yamamoto is the first officer on the http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze] and tried mightily to interject an air of professionalism to the outfit. Constantly enraged by http://anidb.net/ch7034 [Tylor]`s lack of discipline and his loose command of the troops, Yamamoto spends much of his free time in the medic`s office taking tranquilizers and making use of the neuro-cleanser. Yamamoto sees Tylor for what he is, a bumbling fool, but is torn between the unwritten soldier`s code of supporting and obeying your superior officer, and telling the UPSF brass what is REALLY going on. He is always on the lookout for a chance to get some form of command, hoping to get a ship of his own one day.</description>

With the arrival of http://anidb.net/ch7039 [Harumi], he becomes the envy of the entire male crew. He and http://anidb.net/ch7034 [Tylor] are drinking buddies, and he is one of the few crew members to gain a deep understanding of Tylor`s true nature early on. He claims the reason he became a doctor was because "it`s better than being a patient."</description>

<description>The supremely self-confident pilot of the Ranpu-class fighter assigned to the http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze]. Known alternately as "The Samurai of Space" and "The Shoot-Down King," Kojirou graduated with honors from flight training. While he hasn`t logged that many hours of flight time, he shows deadly skill against the Raalgon forces.
Possessing an actual phobia of women, he seems to regard the Hanner sisters as a special case, no doubt owing to their own natural piloting skill. He keeps a small mascot doll the twins made for him in the cockpit of his fighter. He also gets along very poorly with the Marines.</description>

While strongly suspicious of http://anidb.net/ch7050 [Wang]`s motives for starting the war with the United Planets, he lacks the political strenght to directly oppose him. Fiercely loyal to the empress, he does all he can to protect her from the machinations of her ambitious prime minister. However, this patriotism will not let him directly question the war in public, putting him in a very tenuous position within the Imperial Court.</description>
