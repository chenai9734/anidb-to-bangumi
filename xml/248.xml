<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="13836">Well, for those of you who have seen the TV-Series, this short bonus-series might be something ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I warn you: there`s no deep plot, but at least one or two cute girls and the best of the whole "6-Eps-OVA": Haneoto. One of the most beautiful Enka-Songs I know ^^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have your fun ;D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="537611">IMO, much better than Gatekeepers. It`s darker and more serious than the original.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="463837">I didn`t watch the first series, so I don`t know if this is for fans or not, but I loved this OVA. Everything gets rushed through just to make it fit, but the characters are interesting and deep in just a few episodes. If you enjoy superpowers, or happy endings, this is for you.</recommendation>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>school life</name>
<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>He is the childhood friend of Ruriko. When young Ruriko cries, he always comforts her, even though after that, he`ll start calling her Rurippe (sniveler).
He hates his father because for him, he is a liar. When his toy plane got broken, his father promised to fix it, but he was so busy with work that he forgot all about it. That is when he started writing "Otochan no Baka!" (My Dad is an Idiot!) in his dad`s garage. His work has something to do with an engine, and he happened to finish creating it so he promised Shun that he will attend his graduation. Shun did not believe him because he always break his promises. His father insisted that he will come and he promised that they will test the engine after the graduation. Shun agreed to his promise. During their graduation ceremony, he waited for his father but he did not come. His father met a car accident on his way to the graduation ceremony. That happening left a scar in Shun`s heart because for him his father died without even keeping a word.
The death of his father caused his family to have financial problems. He worked as a newspaper boy to support his mother and sister and his schooling too. He is talented in kendo, even though he is just a beginner, he almost hit an experienced opponent. His kendo teacher offered him to join and learn from the basics, and if he does well, he may happen to receive scholarship. But he refused his offer and chose work instead of sports. One time, after doing some newspaper delivery, he met Mr. Matsuda. He helped him in fixing his car, until the Invaders pass by them. He ran after it because it was headed to where his home is. It did not destroy their house, but only a memorable place where he remembers his father carrying him. He got angry and picked up a can and threw it. He noticed that the can was thrown with power. Then he got attacked with Invaders, after he was fallen, a girl healed him and gave some power to him. He ended the Invaders with a gate power that just got out of him. He realized that the girl is his childhood friend. Since then, he joined AEGIS and became a Gate Keeper.</description>

<name>Isuzu Ayane</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>An intelligent student, Ayane is ranked third-highest of her entire class at Tategami High School. Ayane`s classmates consider her to be a geek and more than a little strange, not only because she is seldom seen without her computer, but also because of her introverted attitude and near-hostility to social situations. She has a strong resemblance to Saemi Ukiya but she has an attitude reminiscent of Megumi Kurogane.
When Ayane battles Invaders, she prefers to use pre-programmed imitation Gates that are triggered by specially designed cellular phones. She often uses her computer to strategically time the deployment of the imitation Gates, and also uses various tracking programs to detect and home in on Invader activity.
She is bitter about almost everything, as if she does not care about her surroundings, which is why she has few to no friends at all. Her past is revealed bit-by-bit in each episode, including her reason for avoiding any of the connections to her father. She and her mother were left to fend for themselves when her father, Shun Ukiya, dies battling Invaders. Because of this abandonment she resents using UP-15 and her inherited Gate of Wind. The only thing she treasures is a tiny bell, one of the few happy memories she has from her childhood, which she keeps on the lid of her laptop computer.</description>

<description>Miu is a cheerful, clumsy and often clueless student in Ayane`s class at Tategami High. She has few wants or desires apart from spending time with her friends, going on dates, and managing the school`s soccer team. Miu`s Gate power manifests itself when she attempts to escape from the excessive attentions of one of her dates -- and that is when Ayane discovers her as well, and reluctantly recruits her to the AEGIS cause.
After being recruited by Ayane, Miu starts to hang out with her which makes her friends wonder what made her hang out with such a weird person. When Miu is in Ayane`s presence, she asks if she can do anything, but Ayane either ignores her or just tells her how worthless she is. Miu, upon being asked by Ayane what she is fighting for, answers that she wants to make everyone happy and is just curious. Her close friends, Chinami and Nao, even says that she does not get mad at all.</description>

<description>Tachikawa`s first appearance is in the third episode, where she rescues Miu and her friends when the Invaders attack a Karaoke Bar. Her combat tactics generally revolve around frontal assaults using her gate to materialize a variety of swords and knives.
Summoned to the region by Reiji Kageyama, she arrives as reinforcements for the Top-Ranked hunter, Ayane Isuzu. Unlike Ayane, she does her job with zeal and seems to relish making money from her ventures. The differences in their personalities also fuels the one sided rivalry that she has with Ayane. Ayane is shown to generally ignore her and walks away even during the middle of conversations. This dismissive attitude only serves to frustrate Satoka even more.</description>
