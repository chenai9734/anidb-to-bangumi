<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="586168">Amazing, for me it`s better than the series itself, since I only love the Phantom Troupe especially Machi &amp;lt;3</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="659869">This, in my opinion, is one of the greatest things about Hunter x Hunter.
It`s dark, action packed, depressing, and we get to see another side of the phantom troupe.
The opening and ending are brilliant in my opinion, and they do a very good job setting up the mood for the OVA.
As a Hunter x Hunter fan, I really enjoyed this and I heavily recommend watching this even if you`ve already covered the same events in the 2011 series, because the emotional struggles of certain characters are portrayed much better in the OVA than the remake in my opinion.</recommendation>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>adventure</name>
<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<description>The Weekly Shounen Jump is a Japanese manga magazine released on a weekly basis. Its main target audience consists of young males and it features several manga titles. The magazine was created by http://anidb.net/cr780 [Shueisha] in July, 1968, and was originally only called Shounen Jump, because it was not published every week at the time. A number of very famous shounen manga were or are published in it, such as http://anidb.net/a386 [Hokuto no Ken], http://anidb.net/a231 [Dragon Ball], http://anidb.net/a942 [City Hunter], http://anidb.net/a826 [Saint Seiya], http://anidb.net/a590 [Slam Dunk], http://anidb.net/a312 [Yuu Yuu Hakushou], http://anidb.net/a69 [One Piece], http://anidb.net/a239 [Naruto], http://anidb.net/a2369 [Bleach], http://anidb.net/a4563 [Death Note], http://anidb.net/a3468 [Gintama], to name a few of the most well-known.</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<description>Hisoka is a magician, as well as a serial killer. Hisoka is deceitful, playful, and narcissistic by nature; he acts only according to self-interest. Hisoka combines his magic tricks with violence, and delights in battling against those he considers strong to the point of sexual arousal. In the manga, his sentences within speech balloons typically end with a suit symbol. Hisoka takes an interest in Gon and his friends after encountering them during the Hunter Exam; although he initially is posited as an antagonist due to affinity towards murder, he spends much of the series acting as both an adversary and comrade to Gon.
Nen type: Transmutation
In Hunter`s Character &amp; World Official Databook his height is 187 cm and in manga ch. 377 his height is 190+ cm.

Gon was left in the care of his aunt Mito on Whale Island as an infant by his father Ging, and never saw his father since. Holding great disdain for Ging`s constant travels and putting Gon in danger, she forced Ging to give his son up so he could live normally. Mito told him as a child that his parents were deceased, but Gon eventually figured out the truth and chose the path of a Hunter to meet his father once again.</description>

<description>Leorio meets Gon just as Gon leaves Whale Island to take the Hunter Exam. Much is unknown about Leorio. What we do know is that he once lost a close friend, Pietro, to a debilitating illness. Leorio feels deeply remorseful about being unable to save his friend, as the illness was entirely curable, but required a surgery he could not afford. Thus, he aspires to become a doctor--one that not only cures the ill of their disease, but also waives the fee for the poor. In this light, his outwardly superficial reason to join the Hunter Exams in the pursuit of great wealth has a more noble justification--the money he gains is used not only to fund for his medical school fees, but also to pay for the medicine and other miscellaneous expenditures when treating those who can`t afford it.</description>

During the 287th Hunter`s Exam, Illumi disguised himself as Gittarackur, using special pins to change his entire facial structure. Illumi holds a twisted and emotionless love for Killua. He and Silva raised Killua to believe that the only thing sustaining him was darkness, and that the only joy he received through the world was in causing the death of others. He was also responsible for planting a needle within Killua`s brain, forcing the latter to run from battles he was not sure he could win. Illumi did this to ensure that Killua would able to live to carry on the family business and as a means of protecting his little brother. This needle is self-extracted by Killua in the battle against Rammot. A certain amount of friendship is shared between Hisoka and Illumi, although it is unclear as to how it developed. Illumi once came to the aid of Hisoka by standing in for him as a double in the Phantom Troupe`s hideout, whilst Hisoka attempted to find Chrollo.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Feitan is one of the original members hailing from Meteor City and currently the de facto leader of the Phantom Troupe. He is attired in what one would expect from a bandit — dark clothes partnered with a skullhead scarf that covers his mouth. He seldom speaks, but when he does, it is full of grammatical errors, giving the impression that he is not speaking in his native tongue. During the Phantom Troupe`s fight with Chimera Ants, Feitan reverts to his native language, which was shown with Chinese characters. After Feitan`s victory over Zazan in Meteor City, he is crowned temporary leader of the Phantom Troupe. Feitan`s movements are incredibly fast, being able to leave afterimages of his body. He wields an umbrella that conceals both a sword and a gun that fires out of the tip.
His Nen ability is called "Pain Packer: Unforgiven" which transforms the injuries he has received from his enemy into an attack. The more pain he receives, the stronger his attack is. Currently, only "Rising Sun: Burnt by the Sun" has been revealed, a miniature sun that burns anyone around him disregarding even allies, as shown by the rest of the Phantom Troupe fleeing from the scene when he uses this ability. Only Feitan is unaffected by the attack, presumably because of the armor that is formed on him. Nen type: Transmutation

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Chrollo Lucilfer is the founder and leader of the Phantom Troupe. He forms the group with six other homeless children in Meteor City in his youth, thereafter leaving it. The Troupe was joined by more members, in accordance with Chrollo`s idea of a group with exactly thirteen members, including himself. He organizes the Phantom Troupe mainly to commit acts of theft, though it is unknown what the group does with the stolen objects. His Nen ability also allows him to directly steal the abilities of other users of Nen. He led the genocide on Kurapika`s clan, the latter thereafter stalking Chrollo and neutralizing his Nen ability as punishment. Nen type: Specialization

<description>Bonolenov is covered in bandages and wears boxing gloves. These bandages cover up a large number of holes throughout his body. During the Chimera Ant arc, he was seen fighting with the other members of the Phantom Troupe against the Chimera Ants. His physical power ranks eighth among the Troupe, and he is the thirteenth Troupe member. Bonolenov is a descendant of the Gyudondond, a small wild tribe that was chased out of their lands by development. When males of the Gyudondond tribe reach the age of three, they are circumcised and needles are inserted in various parts of their body. Over time, these needles are replaced with thicker and thicker sticks, and the holes are stabilized with bamboo stalks or stones. Using these holes, Gyudondond males are able to create a variety of sounds. They are called "Bap", the dancing warriors, and fulfill the role of shamans and performers in their tribe. Before combat, they use their bodies to play songs of battle. The Gyudondond believe that the more beautiful a sound that is played, the greater the spirit it can summon. As a member of this clan, Bonolenov possess this as his Nen ability, titled "Batte Le Cantabile".

<description>Very little is known about Kortopi. Exceptionally short in stature, he also has a thick and messy mane of hair covering his entire head, obscuring everything except for an occasional glimpse of his left eyeball. He is the weakest in the Troupe in terms of raw physical power. In fact, his Nen abilities so far suggest that he is not involved in combat at all, but rather theft and subterfuge. His Nen ability is called "Gallery Fake: Divine Left Hand, Demonic Right Hand", which allows him to make perfect copies of any object by touching it with his left hand and producing the copy with his right. The size of the object doesn`t matter. He can also make copies of living humans, but they`ll be immobile and lifeless. He`s also able to know the exact location of any copy he has created by touching the original object. The copies vanish after 24 hours have passed.

<description>Machi is incredibly loyal to Chrollo, and is one of the original Phantom Troupe members from Meteor City. Hisoka seems to have an occasional interest in her, although it is hard to see whether it is genuine. Her ability is to form aura into thread, the strength of which is inversely proportional to its length: a thread as long as the diameter of the Earth would be as strong as cotton, but a one meter-long thread can lift a ton. Besides attacking it can be used to track people, but was also shown used to stitch severed limbs back on. Physically, she is the strongest woman in the Troupe and the sixth strongest overall. She also has an extremely keen intuition (the other members of the Troupe say that she has never been wrong about her intuitions).

Seeing some of Uvogin`s personality in Gon, he expresses interest in having Gon join the Troupe, though Gon adamantly refuses. Nobunaga ranks ninth in physical power among the Troupe, and is one of the original members from Meteor City. Nen type: Enhancement

Phinxs seems to get along best with Feitan, and is almost always seen partnered with him both in and out of combat. His Nen ability is called "Ripper Cyclotron", the strength of which is dependent upon how many times he rotates his arm; the more rotations, the more powerful his attack will be. In terms of physical strength, Phinxs is ranked second among the Troupe members. His name is an anagram for "Sphinx".

<description>Shalnark is member number six of the Phantom Troupe, and from his appearance, he seems to be a normal boy. However, he is one of the most intelligent and quick-thinking members in the group, being highly adept at using computers and information gathering. Shalnark is also a licensed Hunter, so he has access to certain information that could be potentially useful to the Phantom Troupe. His main ability revolves around remotely manipulating the actions of others using his cell phone by sticking a specialized antenna into their bodies. His secondary ability involves applying the antenna upon himself and putting his body on autopilot, resulting in an enhanced state with enough power to devastate most opponents. However, he dislikes this ability because he is subject to immense muscle pain for several days after its use, and as he has no control over the process and retains no memory over what has transpired he can`t derive any pleasure or satisfaction when he uses it to win a fight. Shalnark ranks tenth in physical power among the Troupe.

<description>Senritsu (Melody) is an Music Hunter and is the kind and understanding member of Neon`s bodyguards. She is always ready to listen to anyone`s confessions and has the gift to make people open up to her. As Leorio notes, she is one of the very few characters who has made Kurapika open up to her. Melody`s physical appearance is in short contrast to her kind soul. Due to effects of the "Sonata of Darkness", a musical piece said to have been written by Satan himself and possibly inspired by the Devil`s Trill Sonata, her body is a short and her face disfigured. However, she was not always like this; she was once a normal person. She was transformed when she and a friend listened to the Sonata of Darkness. It is composed of four parts: piano, violin, flute, and harp, and it is said that whomever listens to it will be greatly cursed. Melody`s goal is to find the sonata and destroy it. Melody has the ability to emit her aura to people to soothe ease fatigue when she plays an instrument. She also has a very sharp sense of hearing and can tell a person`s psychological state just by listening to their heartbeat. For example, she knows when people are lying or when someone has completely lost his/her temper.

<description>Neon Nostrade is the only daughter of the head of the Nostrade family, Light Nostrade. She has the ability to predict the future through her fortune tellings which are always accurate, but are slightly cryptic due to their use of abstract references to events. Neon appears in the story when Kurapika interviews for a position among her bodyguards. Neon is spoiled; she receives everything she demands by threatening to cease the use of her ability for her father`s benefit. Neon is also very involved with the occult and is an avid collector of rare human flesh, such as the Scarlet Eyes of the Kurta Clan.
Neon cares very little about anything else other than her collection; even the death of her head bodyguard, Dalzollene, causes her no grief. However, when Eliza, a family attendant, is heartbroken, Neon agrees to leave Yorknew City, despite not having obtained the auction items she desired. She loses her ability to Chrollo.
