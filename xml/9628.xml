<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>elements</name>
<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<description>Music anime generally revolves around people concerned with music in their everyday lives. In addition they often adhere to certain genre conventions, the emphasis on training and practice in preparation for competitions, characters desire for self improvement, and pursuit of a specific goal. This is not unlike the Sports category.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>fan-made</name>
<description>Produced by an unofficial entity, totally unrelated to any commercial production studio/company (maybe even a group of friends with an idea, access to some equipment, a very tight budget, and lots of spare time). "Made for fans by fans" in its purest form.
Don`t expect big-bucks animation, top-notch voice actors or overly-elaborate scripts, but sometimes you can get a very nice surprise from that kind of productions, so don`t write them off that fast!
In Japan, this kind of of productions is also known as "doujin" (同人) - self-published works.</description>

<name>Hakurei Reimu</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine, a remote building far in the east where the boundaries of Gensokyo and the human world overlap. Reimu is very easygoing— some would say lazy— and hates to train. As such, even though she`s naturally talented, her offensive and magical abilities are only average. However, she has a strong sense of duty, and if it`s for the sake of Gensokyo she can overcome almost any obstacle through sheer perseverance. Her main abilities are flying in the sky, good intuition, and getting along with everyone; even those who were once her enemies.</description>

<name>Remilia Scarlet</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Remilia is the vampiric mistress of the Scarlet Devil Mansion who claims to be descended from Vlad III Dracula although she is not. She is known as the Scarlet Devil as when she feeds, the blood of her victims stains her dress red. Apart from her unpleasant needs, she`s hardly malicious enough to deserve such a title; merely childish, even though she`s over five hundred years old. Although being a vampire is normally a lonely life, she has a good relationship with her many employees (including Sakuya and Meiling).</description>

<description>Sakuya is the only human living in the Scarlet Devil Mansion, yet she is also the head maid. Though she looks about sixteen like the other girls, Sakuya has the ability to slow, stop and possibly reverse time. She seems to have been serving Remilia for a long time and may be far older than she looks. Her talents are cooking, knife throwing and time manipulation.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Flandre is the younger sister of Remilia and the "dirty little secret" of Scarlet Devil Mansion. Because of her unstable personality and incredible destructive power, her sister has had her ordered not to get out of the mansion for nearly 500 years. She knows little about the world outside and until the heroines arrived during the Extra Stage of Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, she has had no substantive contact with any humans other than Sakuya.</description>
