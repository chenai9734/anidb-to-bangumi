<description>The year is Universal Century 0088. Directly after the end of the Gryps War, Haman Karn and her army of Zeon remnants on the asteroid Axis begin their quest of reviving the lost empire of the Zabi`s, and proclaim themselves as the Neo-Zeon. With the Earth Federation as helpless as ever, only the Anti-Earth Union Group (AEUG) is able to oppose the plans of Neo-Zeon. In need of all the help it can get after being decimated in the previous war and losing many of its key members, the AEUG ship Argama enlists the aid of a young junk collector from the Side 1 colony of Shangri-La named Judau Ashta to pilot its newest mobile suit, the Double Zeta Gundam.</description>

<name>military</name>
<description>The military, also known as the armed forces, are forces authorized and legally entitled to use deadly force so as to support the interests of the state and its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its citizens and the prosecution of war against foreign powers. The military may also have additional functions within a society, including construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding critical areas.

Not having even finished school, they are inexplicably designated to elite status or roles, typically requiring months of training and years of experience.

<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<name>impact event</name>
<description>An impact event is a collision between celestial objects causing measurable effects. Impact events have physical consequences and have been found to regularly occur in planetary systems, though the most frequent involve asteroids, comets or meteoroids and have minimal impact. When large objects impact terrestrial planets like the Earth, there can be significant physical and biospheric consequences, though atmospheres mitigate many surface impacts through atmospheric entry. Impact structures are dominant landforms on many celestial solid objects and present the strongest empirical evidence for their frequency and scale. In fiction, an impact event is a common way to end the world as we know it, either through the impact itself or through its aftermath, and it may happen either naturally or through human hands; this may include man-made objects, such as space debris and fictional space colonies.

<description>Many anime are created as part of larger projects encompassing many shows without direct relation to one another. Normally, there is a specific idea in mind: for example, the http://anidb.net/t4859 [Young Animator Training Project] aims to stimulate the on-the-job training of next-generation professionals of the anime industry, whereas the http://anidb.net/t3763 [World Masterpiece Theatre] aims to animate classical stories from all over the world.</description>

<name>Super Robot Wars</name>
<description>Super Robot Wars is a series of tactical role-playing video games produced by Banpresto. The main feature of the franchise is having a story that crosses over several popular mecha anime, manga and video games, allowing characters and mecha from different titles to team up or battle one another. Due to the nature of crossover games and licensing involved, only a few games have been released outside Japan, and in English; early English-language games only feature Banpresto`s original characters and mecha, and a flagship installment were to never be released until 2016, with the English release of Super Robot Wars V in Southeast Asian countries. The franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2016.

<description>The unified world government that launched the space settlement program and now rules over both Earth and the space colonies. Its main decision-making body is the Earth Federation Assembly, which meets occasionally to pass new legislation.
Though not as cruel and aggressive as the Principality of Zeon`s leaders, the bureaucrats who rule over the Earth Federation are corrupt, weak-willed, and insensitive to the space colonists` desire for independence. After the One Year War, the Federation decides to concentrate its energies on reconstructing Earth instead of the space colonies, further increasing political tensions.</description>

<description>This prototype mobile suit was developed by the Titans at the Gryps space colony. Based on the legendary RX-78 Gundam, the Mk.II inherits its predecessor`s high performance and remarkable potential, although it suffers from a few lingering design flaws - notably, its obsolete armour materials. On the other hand, the Mk.II also introduces the radical new movable frame design concept, giving it superb manoeuvrability. All three prototype units are captured by the AEUG resistance group during their raid on the Titans` headquarters. The rebels keep one in service, replacing its sinister Titans colours with a more heroic white and blue scheme, and eagerly dissect the other two in order to learn their technological secrets.</description>

<description>The Hyaku Shiki is a prototype machine created as part of the AEUG`s secret "Zeta Project." Its name, which means "Type 100," reflects both its model number and the ambition of its designer Dr. Nagano that this mobile suit would last a hundred years. Originally designed as a transformable model, the Hyaku Shiki`s transformation mechanisms proved to be defective, and it was redesigned as a high-performance non-transformable mobile suit. The Hyaku Shiki`s beam-resistant coating gives it an eye-catching golden exterior, well suited for the use of the AEUG`s principal pilot.</description>

Able to transport ten to twenty mobile suits and an equivalent number of support sleds - and, incidentally, capable of launching Temptation-class space shuttles into orbit! - the Audhumla makes an excellent airborne carrier. Others of its class, like the Sudori and Melord, are similarly employed by the pursuing Titans.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Haro is the mechanical mascot of the Gundam science fiction anime metaseries, and is the only character that appears in more than one timeline.
The original Haro is a little robot companion built by the main character Amuro Ray. It is a cute testament to Amuro`s exceptional talent for machines. Haro`s features include a limited range of speech, and the ability to hover (in environments with atmosphere and low gravity) by flapping its ear-like appendage coverings. Haro can usually be found rolling behind Amuro`s next door neighbor Frau Bow. The ability to detect brain waves is also one of Haro`s functions; in one of the episodes, Haro actually claimed that the brain wave of Amuro was lowered/different.
In Zeta Gundam, a mass-produced Mk-II version of Haro ends up in the hands of that series` main protagonist Kamille Bidan, who initially suspects it to be the original. He repairs the robot, only to have it constantly address him as Amuro.
During the events of Char`s Counterattack, Amuro gives a "third-generation" Haro to Hathaway, the son of his captain Bright Noa.
Haro continues to permeate the Gundam franchise, having appeared in Gundam SEED as Lacus Clyne`s multi-colored horde of simple-speech robot pets, built for her by Athrun Zala. These Haros are roughly 1/4 the size of their Universal Century counterparts and are similar in function, however a few possess certain abilities such as unlocking doors. Lacus`s favorite Haro is a pink machine that she refers to as "Pink-Chan" (often translated as "Mr. Pink" or "Pinky"). Another notable Haro in Lacus`s collection is "Navy-Chan", a navy blue robot on which she paints a mustache bearing a distinct resemblance the facial ornament of the ∀ Gundam of the CC (正歴 Seireki) calendar system. The rest of Lacus` Haros have been seen in yellow, orange, blue, green, and black. The parody comic Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Club Yonkoma states that Athrun has built a total of 35 Haros for Lacus.
In Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Celestial Being had produced unknown numbers of Haros as an assistant of daily maintenance works. Currently at least 6 unique Haros have appeared in the animation production. The Haros in the series took much more maintenance and combat role than any other series` counterpart, usually seeing them operating with various machines, including mobile weapons.</description>

<description>In U.C. 0093, Zeon Zum Deikun`s son, Casval Rem Deikun (aka Zeon`s legendary ace, Char Aznable, the "Red Comet"), created a second Neo Zeon. This movement was founded under the ceremonial goal of "speeding up" the space migration of all of humanity, so the theoretical evolution of humanity into Newtypes could be realised. Char`s plan involved a series of massive asteroid drops against the Earth, ultimately leading to an eternal nuclear winter, rendering the planet uninhabitable. The final collision attempt was to involve the Axis asteroid, headquarters of the previous Neo Zeon movement. The plan was ultimately foiled by the Federation`s Londo Bell taskforce, headed by Bright Noa, and his old adversary from the One Year War, Amuro Ray, when Amuro managed to push the falling Axis away, sacrificing himself and killing Char in the process (while their deaths were never officially confirmed in the movie, their deaths are confirmed in the novelization of Char`s Counterattack). Char`s loss of the second Neo Zeon movement effectively ended the Zeon/Neo Zeon movement.
In U.C. 0100, the Republic of Zeon officially rejoined the Earth Federation.</description>

<name>Anaheim Electronics</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="3">Organization</charactertype>
<description>Anaheim Electronics is a fictional civilian manufacturing company that appeared in the Universal Century timeline of the Gundam anime metaseries. The company appeared first in Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam(aired in 1985) as the main funder, as well as the main military supplier and manufacturer of the faction AEUG. However, the company also design and manufacture weapons for both the Earth Federation, its elite faction Titans, enemy of the AEUG, and third party faction Axis Zeon, which in turn became the enemies of the AEUG later in the series until the end of the sequel, Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ(aired in 1986). The company continues its manufacturing contracts in Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ and Mobile Suit Gundam: Char`s Counterattack(aired in 1988), where its weapons are always seen in both sides of the conflicting factions. In the novel, Gundam Sentinel(serialized in 1989), which happens between the conflicts of the anime series Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam and Mobile suit Gundam ZZ, Anaheim Electronics became the main contractor of the Earth Federation of its new mass-production units like Nero and the Z Plus series for the Task Force alpha and also provided prototype units such as S Gundam as a testbed for the Federation. The Gundam Sentinel`s Model Graphix special edition, Gundam Wars III, the battle of real Gundam in turn gave a detail analysis of the company and retconned the production and testing history. The company`s earlier history was then told in the anime Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory(OVA first released in 1991), where it first became the contract manufacturer of the Earth Federation. In December 2003, celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the Gundam metaseries, a book Anaheim Journal was released, disguised as a monthly magazine published by Anaheim Electronics in UC0100. The company also appeared in the comic Silhouette Formula 91, and later in the anime Mobile Suit V Gundam.
Based on the Moon, Anaheim Electronics originally produced a wide range of technological applications from consumer electronics to battleships and even space colonies. Their service do not end at electronic goods, according to Anaheim Journal, they also have departments providing cosmetics, vacation travelling plans (with their own resort space colonies) and credit cards, ultimately fitting the definition of a zaibatsu. Upon the end of the One Year War, Anaheim was able to acquire the assets and personnel of the Zeonic Corporation - a mobile suit manufacturing firm of the defeated Principality of Zeon. This merger enabled Anaheim Electronics to enter the lucrative business of mobile suit production. As such, the firm was contracted by the Earth Federation to become its principal mobile suit provider until the end of the second Neo Zeon movement.
Anaheim Electronics is known for its profit-oriented mindset - creating advanced mobile weapons for any faction that would be willing to pay, then selling the same technology to the former`s enemy. During the rise of the oppressive Titans taskforce, Anaheim funded the AEUG and gave it access to their technology and safe shelter as the Titans restricted their trading engagements, despite the Earth Federation Forces and the Titans being their primary customer. Later, the company would service contracts from the remnants of the Principality of Zeon such as Axis and Neo Zeon. According to GundamOfficials, this is due to the gigantic company structure. With several development departments, each departments can be contracted by different factions without needing to notify the main executive board. This policy is simply adopted to minimize the companies overall responsibility; after the main battle, they can always just apply the penalty on a single department`s head instead of making the whole company suffer.
In the story of Silhouette Formula 91, after U.C. 0123, Anaheim Electronics lost its contract bid with the EFF to SNRI`s new miniaturized mobile suit designs, which were cheaper, more versatile and higher in performance. Anaheim Electronics had to maintain its low profile until U.C. 0153, and financially supported League Militaire in secrecy defending Earth from Zanscare Empire.
According to the official timeline, Anaheim Electronics remains as the main manufacturer of mobile suits in the Earth Sphere until the Earth Federation itself was disbanded in the U.C. 0200s, although its monopoly in the field was literally obliterated since the second Universal Century with the entrance of the Federation-backed competitor SNRI.

<description>A Titan pilot distinguished by his superb fighting skills and sheer aggression. Yazan joins the crew of the Titan cruiser Alexandria around the time of the attack on Von Braun City and becomes the ship`s resident ace pilot, eclipsing the hapless Jerid Messa. Brutal and bloodthirsty, he lives for the thrill of the hunt, and despises cautious commanders who try to spoil his fun. He`s later joined by a pair of equally cunning and sadistic wingmen, Ensigns Dunkel Cooper and Ramsus Hasa.

<description>A citizen of the space colony Shangri-La, Beecha Oleg originally worked alongside Judau Ashta as a junk dealer, but through a series of events becomes a Hyaku Shiki pilot mobile suit pilot for the Argama. Initially his unhappiness with military life and rivalry with Judau cause him to temporarily switch sides with Mondo Agake until the abuse they suffered from Gottn and the other crew members of the Endra made both of them realize they were happier on the Argama. However, as the conflict continues, Beecha grows out of his childish ways. Assuming command of the Argama`s successor battleship, the Nahel Argama, he even finds the courage to express his affection for long time love interest Elle Vianno.

Roux Louka becomes the pilot of Zeta Gundam when Judau Ashta changes over to the MSZ-010 ΖΖ Gundam A regular soldier and older than Judau and his counterparts, her patronizing attitude towards them initially causes friction, but eventually an unfaltering bond of trust forms between them. However, she still gets into many arguments with fellow pilot Elle Vianno during the course of the series, possibly due to the fact that both women have a romantic interest on Judau. Despite mixed feelings between the enemy pilot Glemy Toto and herself, Roux kills him in their final confrontation by incinerating him with Zeta`s beam rifle. After the war, she joins the Jupiter Fleet along with Judau, and seems to begin a relationship with him.

But she has shown an ability to care for others, choosing not to kill certain people she had come across. While a seemingly perfect killer and always obeying Glemy`s orders without question, she does defect and the pressure she gains when fighting other Newtypes does cause massive amounts of pain to her at times, such as Judau. It is possible she is a bit mentally unstable.

<description>The captain of the Neo Zeon ship "Endra". He is always seen wearing a garnished flower that Haman Khan gave to him, due to his obsession with her. He is first seen as an optimistic young officer and finds himself in a few comical situations among his own crew. However, a series of defeats at the hands of Judau Ashta and the AEUG, control of the Endra is handed over to Chara Soon.
At his second appearance he has largely abandoned his pacifistic and idealistic concepts and has adapted a colder, more destitute outlook towards battle.

He was noticeably calmer than the two commanders he served under, though prone to bouts of emotion when he was reciprocated with similar loyalty. Perhaps because he was at best a mediocre pilot Gottn preferred combat tactics that relied on traps, ambushes, and other surprises.

When trying to get something from men she often uses "feminine wiles" to obtain it.

<description>Glemy is a young man of average height, with blonde hair, and blue eyes, giving him an appearance similar to Char Aznable. Unlike the other soldiers of Neo Zeon, Glemy is honorable, chivalrous, and overall goofy. He condemns the use of underhanded strategies in battle, such as using hostages, and believes in refined manners, believing both men and women should act and behave in a sophisticated demeanor, while thinking lowly of those who do not. Glemy`s good nature also makes him very gullible, shown by him being deceived numerous times by others, on top of that his acts of chivalry more then often make him appear as a fool. Glemy has another side to him though; beneath his good and foolish demeanor he has shown that he can be heartless and manipulative. This was demonstrated by his manipulating of Elpeo Ple`s memories to make her a merciless soldier.

<description>The AMA-01X Jamru-Fin is a transformable mobile armor being developed by Neo Zeon during the First Neo Zeon War that is never completed. Instead, the three unfinished prototypes are fitted with makeshift arms and heads and put into service, piloted by the "3-D" team of Dell, Dune and Danny. The Jamru-Fin is a very fast and powerful mobile armor, its primary armament being a high-powered hyper mega cannon capable of knocking out enemy warships outside of their sensor ranges. The Jamru-Fin can transform into a squat, mobile suit-like form armed with hand mounted beam guns/beam sabers for close combat. Its mobile armor form can also be fitted with a "mega booster" which mounts additional weapons, increased the Jamru-Fin`s speed and range, and also increasing the output power of its hyper mega cannon. The Jamru-Fin is also designed to be fitted with another, much larger, super-long-range booster powered by a nuclear pulse engine capable of operating in the intense gravity well of Jupiter.

<description>As the First Neo Zeon War rages on, the Neo Zeon military continues its development of new and more powerful mobile suits. Two competing designs are produced as potential new mass production frontline units: the AMX-011 Zaku III and the AMX-014 Dooben-Wolf. The intention of the Zaku III`s design is to be a new descendant of the old Principality of Zeon`s venerable (and highly versatile) MS-05 Zaku I and MS-06 Zaku II lines. The Zaku III features a modular construction design, enabling armor, the backpack, and other components to be changed out and customized pursuant to the current mission role. Despite its high performance and versatility, however, the Zaku III design loses out to the more contemporary Dooben-Wolf. As a result, the Zaku III sees only limited production, with a handful of prototypes often operated by high-ranking officers or ace pilots.

<description>Although the AMX-011 Zaku III design loses out to the AMX-014 Dooben-Wolf as Neo Zeon`s intended new frontline mass production mobile suit, several Zaku III prototypes are produced. These Zaku IIIs prove quite popular with many Neo Zeon officers and ace pilots fighting in the First Neo Zeon War. One Zaku III unit ends up in the hands of Haman Karn loyalist Mashymre Cello, who employs his customized Zaku III in one of the last battles of the war. Although Mashymre`s Zaku III is referred to as the AMX-011S Zaku III Custom, it`s indeed nothing more than the basic Zaku III loaded out with various optional equipment selected by Mashymre. His Zaku III Custom sports heavier and more stylized armor, a new head mounting a pair of vulcan guns, optional left shoulder armor with a hide bomb dispenser, a large backpack with powerful thrusters and ejectable external propellant tanks, and an enormous rear skirt armor plate.

<description>A new mass production design which beat out the competing AMX-011 Zaku III during the First Neo Zeon War, the AMX-014 Dooben-Wolf is found to be much more powerful and contemporary than its competition by the Neo Zeon military. Using design concepts taken from the salvaged Titans` mobile suit MRX-010 Psyco Gundam Mark II, the Dooben-Wolf incorporates a wide variety of beam weapons all over its body, including wire-guided remote beam gun forearms and wire-guided remote "incom" beam guns, all controlled by a "quasi-psycommu" computer control system. These features allow a normal, non-Newtype pilot to conduct all-range attacks similar to those made by a Newtype pilot using a standard psycommu system. In addition to its plethora of beam weapons, the Dooben-Wolf also mounts missile launchers, grenade launchers, and vulcan guns for additional firepower. However, its primary armament is its high-powered beam rifle, which can be connected directly to the mega particle guns in its abdomen and fired as an even more powerful "mega launcher" weapon. All of these weapons and features help to make the Dooben-Wolf one of the single most powerful mobile suit designs developed during the First Neo Zeon War. Many of the Dooben-Wolf units produced are operated by pilots working for Glemy Toto`s anti-Haman Karn faction during Neo Zeon`s internal conflicts near the end of the war.

<description>Another mobile suit developed in anticipation of their assault on Earth during the First Neo Zeon War, Neo Zeon`s AMX-101 Galluss-J is a slightly less impressive performer than the AMX-009 Dreissen. However, the ease of its production leads the Galluss-J to see at least limited production on Neo Zeon`s frontlines. Intended to work in concert with the AMX-102 Zssa, the Galluss-J is well-suited to urban combat and cleanup operations following a target area`s bombardment. In addition to a light ranged armament of missiles and a handheld energy gun, the Galluss-J is very good for hand-to-hand combat, as its hands can launch outward to deliver extra kinetic force to its punches. The fingers of the Galluss-J`s left hand are also equipped with small-caliber machine guns inside them. One of the earliest Galluss-J units to be built is employed by Neo Zeon officer Mashymre Cello, who uses this mobile suit to attempt to ferret out the refugee AEUG battleship Argama from its hiding place inside Side 1`s Shangri-La Colony. An artillery variant, the AMX-101K Galluss-K, is also developed. Several Galluss-J and Galluss-K units are used by Zeon remnants in an attack on Australia`s Torrington Base in U.C. 0096.

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>As Axis/Neo Zeon begin openly moving to conquer the Earth Sphere at the outbreak of the First Neo Zeon War in U.C. 0088, they develop several prototype mobile suits to serve as testbeds for advanced new technologies. One of these prototypes is the AMX-103 Hamma Hamma, whose primary function is to test the new "quasi-psycommu" system. The quasi-psycommu is a computer control system designed to allow normal (non-Newtype) pilots to operate wire-guided remote weapons and conduct all-range attacks in a fashion similar to Newtype-use mobile weapons equipped with a standard psycommu system. The Hamma Hamma`s quasi-psycommu is intended to control its two wire-guided claw-hands, each of which is armed with a 3-barreled beam gun. This is the only armament mounted on the Hamma Hamma itself, as the remaining reactor output is required to operate the large number of thrusters arrayed on the massive shoulder and skirt armor of this highly maneuverable mobile suit. In order to be equipped with additional beam weaponry, the Hamma Hamma can also carry a shield that is equipped with its own independent power generator. This generator powers the weapons mounted on the shield, which include three linked beam guns, a pair of beam sabers, and a space mine launcher.

<description>One of many new prototype mobile suits developed by Neo Zeon during the First Neo Zeon War, the AMX-104 R-Jarja`s form is inspired by the old Principality of Zeon`s YMS-15 Gyan from the One Year War. Like the Gyan, the R-Jarja is designed primarily for melee combat, and is armed with a large hand-carried beam sword and a removable heat saber mounted like a bayonet on its beam rifle. Two sets of missile launchers in the shoulders round out its armament, but the R-Jarja features a rather unique defensive feature. This feature is the pair of "flexible shields" mounted on its shoulders, which can be flipped to provide additional armor protection to either the front or rear of the R-Jarja. Initially a single prototype that is intended for later mass production, the R-Jarja never makes it past the experimental stage, with one completed unit operated by ace pilot Chara Soon.

<description>Another high-performance prototype developed by Neo Zeon during the First Neo Zeon War, the AMX-107 Bawoo is the first Zeon-style transformable mobile suit which can separate into more than one component. In the Bawoo`s case, the mobile suit can separate into two separate fighters, called Bawoo Attacker and Bawoo Nutter. The initial prototype features a cockpit in each of the two fighters, but the final production version features a single pilot occupying the Attacker and an unmanned Nutter controlled either via wireless remote control from the pilot in the Attacker, or - if the area`s Minovsky particle density is thick enough to jam transmissions - by an onboard auto-pilot computer control system. The two components can also be quickly re-combined into the mobile suit mode. These features make the Bawoo the first mobile weapon that allows its pilot to effectively control more than one combat unit in the field at the same time. Along with its beam rifle, beam sabers, and grenade launchers, the Bawoo also carries a shield which mounts five, fire-linked mega particle guns, greatly increasing its firepower. Although initially planned as a limited production unit for high-ranking officers and aces (with one custom, orange-colored unit operated by Glemy Toto), the Bawoo`s versatility offered by its transformation systems make it highly popular, and the Bawoo soon finds its way into full mass production.

<description>The pinnacle of Zeon Newtype-use mobile weapon technology at its time, the NZ-000 Queen Mansa is considered one of the most powerful mobile weapons ever constructed. Designed and constructed by Neo Zeon`s Glemy Toto faction during the First Neo Zeon War, the Queen Mansa combines the best features of the successful AMX-004 Qubeley series and the Titans` MRX-010 Psyco Gundam Mark II into one design. This massive mobile suit is armed with wide variety of beam weapons, and carries 30 psycommu-controlled funnels in a large tail binder. The massive binders on its shoulders house a variant of the I-field barrier concept called a mega particle deflection system, which not only absorbs or deflects incoming beam weapons fire like a standard I-field, but can also redirect that beam fire back at the foe that fired it. Like the AMX-004-3 Qubeley Mark II, the Queen Mansa can be controlled externally via a psycommu controller headset worn by the pilot, and like the Psyco Gundam Mark II (and even the old Principality of Zeon`s MSN-02 Zeong), the Queen Mansa`s head can detach and operate independently if the main body is heavily damaged and destroyed.

The Desert Zaku can also be fitted with a pair of jet skis on its feet, making it easy to glide at high speed across the desert sand. Though normally used by Zeon remnants led by "Desert" Rommel in North Africa in U.C. 0088, a few Desert Zakus also land in the hands of the African Liberation Front, with one unit operating as part of their "Blue Team" and painted in their distinctive light-blue-on-blue colors. Zeon remnants continue to make use of the Desert Zaku as late as U.C. 0096 during an attack on Australia`s Torrington Base.

<description>One of the last evolutions of the old Principality of Zeon`s MS-09 Dom series, the MS-09G Dwadge (not to be confused with the MS-10 Pezun Dowadge of Zeon`s "Pezun Project") continues to be used for many years after the One Year War. By the time of the First Neo Zeon War in U.C. 0088, the Dwadge is operated by several parties, including the new Neo Zeon military, old African-based Zeon remnants from the One Year War, and the civilian African Liberation Front. Although quite similar to its predecessor, the Dwadge is an improvement over the well-proven and successful Dom in that it also mounts four vulcan guns in the head and carries an external propellant tank on its backpack, thus extending the operational time for using the Dwadge`s ground-skimming hovering jets. The Dwadge remains in use with Zeon remnants as late as U.C. 0096 during an attack on Australia`s Torrington Base.

<description>One of the MS-09G Dwadge ground combat mobile suits still in use following the One Year War is owned by "Desert" Rommel, leader of a band of Zeon remnants still operating in Africa. Rommel`s Dwadge is modified and upgraded over the years, and by the time of the First Neo Zeon War in U.C. 0088, his mobile suit - now designated the MS-09H Dwadge Reinforcement Type - is a step above the standard model. It features extra thrusters mounted on its shoulders, and it can use a large, hand-operated beam cannon for greater firepower.

<description>The return of Zeon remnants aboard the asteroid base Axis to the Earth Sphere in the last weeks of the Gryps Conflict results in an even more turbulent political climate, and Anaheim Electronics - one of the AEUG`s primary supporters - is forced to provide mobile suit technology to the Axis (and later Neo Zeon) forces. One Anaheim mobile suit design to fall into Neo Zeon`s hands is the RMS-099B Schuzrum Dias, an improvement over the well-proven RMS-099 Rick Dias used by the AEUG. The only changes to the basic mobile suit itself are a larger rear skirt armor piece and a flared-out armor piece on the head to provide extra protection for the monoeye sensors. However, the most noticeable change seen on the Schuzrum Dias is the replacement of the old random binder backpack propellant tanks with two large grye binders, which mount extra thrusters and verniers, an even greater fuel capacity for extended flight time and beam cannons for additional firepower. These features make the Schuzrum Dias an even more well-performing unit over the tried-and-true Rick Dias, and the supply of these mobile suits to Haman Karn`s Neo Zeon forces is the start of another trend of "playing both sides against the middle." Anaheim, always out to make a profit no matter who`s winning or losing, develops and sells new mobile suits to both Federation and Zeon forces for several years to come.

<description>A new amphibious combat mobile suit designed and built by the Earth Federation Forces, the RMS-192M Zaku Mariner is an improved descendant of the old Principality of Zeon`s MS-06M Zaku Marine Type used in the One Year War. Armed with a total of 14 SUBROC (SUBmarine ROCket) launchers in its shoulders and backpack, as well as a magnet harken shocking cable weapon for melee combat, and a handheld spray missile gun, the Zaku Mariner packs more firepower than its Zaku Marine Type predecessor. In addition to being a better performer in terms of power, the backpack can be ejected in order for the Mariner to go ashore and conduct limited ground combat (a similar feature is also utilized by the later Neo Zeon AMS-129M Zee Zulu). However, the Federation Forces never get to deploy these units; instead, they fall into the hands of Neo Zeon, who acquire them with the capture of several Federation bases following their Earth invasion during the First Neo Zeon War in U.C. 0088. Zeon remnants also make use of the Zaku Mariner during an attack on Australia`s Torrington Base in U.C. 0096.

<description>Following the successful testing of Newtype pilots Elpeo Ple and Ple Two using their Qubeley Mark II mobile suits, Glemy Toto begins mass production of an improved Qubeley to be manned by his army of Ple Two clones. Called the AMX-004G Qubeley Mass Production Type, this production-line unit is introduced in January UC 0089 during the last days of the First Neo Zeon War. Although in many ways similar to the Qubeley Mark IIs, the Mass Production Type features greater firepower in two areas: a pair of "active cannons" on its backpack, capable of firing in a wide arc covering both the mobile suit`s front and rear; and a larger-capacity tail binder, capable of holding 30 remote funnel weapons. With a Newtype army at his command, Glemy starts his civil war against Haman; however, very determined Haman loyalists stop the Ple clones and their mass-produced Qubeleys, resulting in an almost complete mutual annihilation of both Neo Zeon factions. Early production models are painted gray, but the final production models are rolled out in a black paint scheme similar to the Qubeley Mark II. At least one mass production Qubeley, possibly the unit piloted by Ple Twelve, falls into the hands of the mysterious Vist Foundation by UC 0096.

<description>Essentially the last in the "Gaza" line built by Neo Zeon during the First Neo Zeon War in U.C. 0088, the AMX-008 Ga-Zowmn is actually quite a radical departure from its AMX-003 Gaza-C and AMX-006 Gaza-D predecessors. The Ga-Zowmn is also a transformable unit, and both its mobile suit and mobile armor modes are armed with an improved hyper knuckle buster beam rifle and a pair of 9-tube launchers equipped with large missiles. The Ga-Zowmn is also armed with beam sabers and vulcan guns in its forearms for close-range and melee combat. However, its heavy firepower make this general purpose mobile suit more appropriately used as an offensive mobile suit. In U.C. 0096, the Ga-Zowmn remains in service with the "Sleeves" faction of Neo Zeon.

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>A Newtype- and Cyber Newtype-use mobile suit intended for mass production in the last weeks of the First Neo Zeon War, the AMX-015 Geymalk is one of the pinnacles of Neo Zeon`s Newtype weaponry development. In terms of firepower alone, the Geymalk is one of the most heavily-armed mobile suits of its time, with over 20 beam weapons mounted on a single, regular-sized mobile suit body. In addition to this high number of weapons, the Geymalk is also equipped with a psycommu system, allowing its Newtype pilot to control its two large "mother" funnels. The mother funnels are actually bits in principle, since they have their own onboard reactor for power and don`t need to return to the Geymalk to be recharged. While each mother funnel mounts a mega particle gun, they each also carry 14 "child" funnels, which are normal-style funnels which recharge aboard the mother funnels. With this second tier of remote control, the Geymalk`s pilot can conduct all-range attacks at extremely long ranges. The pilot`s commands are relayed via a large psycommu control antenna on the Geymalk`s head, which relay the commands to the mother funnels, which in turn relay the commands to the child funnels. This advanced remote weapon system, combined with the mobile suit`s tremendous firepower, make the Geymalk one of the most powerful mobile suits ever conceived at its time. Only one unit is known to have been built, operated by Haman Karn loyalist Chara Soon during the last days of the war when Neo Zeon is being torn apart by internal conflicts. Chara demonstrates the Geymalk`s abilities when she almost single-handedly destroys an entire squadron of powerful, genetically-engineered Ple Two clones operating funnel-equipped AMX-004G Qubeley Mass Production Types.

<description>Another mobile suit developed in anticipation of their assault on Earth during the First Neo Zeon War, Neo Zeon`s AMX-102 Zssa is designed as a long-range bombardment unit for attacking targets from behind the front lines. Intended to work in concert with the AMX-101 Galluss-J, the Zssa is armed with 44 missiles as its primary armament. In addition to beam sabers, a scattering beam gun, and a pair of vulcan guns for closer-range and melee combat, the Zssa can also be fitted with an optional pair of shoulder missile pods containing 7 additional missiles each. An optional booster can also be mounted on the Zssa`s back, giving the mobile suit an additional 8 missiles and the ability to fly in the atmosphere, allowing the Zssa to conduct aerial bombardments. The Zssa proves itself quite effective as a long-range strike unit, and it`s one of the most commonly mass produced Neo Zeon mobile suits used in the war. Some units survive the First Neo Zeon War and are later used by the "Sleeves" faction of Neo Zeon in U.C. 0096.

<description>As Neo Zeon launches its invasion of Earth during the First Neo Zeon War in U.C. 0088, they employ several new mobile suit designs built for terrestrial combat. One of these units is the AMX-109 Capule, which is an amphibious mobile suit based loosely on the old Principality of Zeon`s MSM-03 Gogg from the One Year War. Armed with eight missile launchers, a sonic blast weapon in its waist, and a laser beam "eye" on its small, flat head, this small mobile suit packs an enormous amount of firepower for its size, all cooled by a hydro-cooling system. The Capule`s arms can fold up inside its main body and its legs can fold back, turning the mobile suit into a mobile armor-like form that is faster and more streamlined when moving underwater. In its mobile armor mode, the Capule can also move along the water`s surface in a fashion similar to a hovercraft. However, the Capule seems to have lost many of the lessons learned by the Principality of Zeon during its amphibious mobile suit development during the One Year War. As a result, the Capule proves to be an inefficient design and is highly unpopular with its pilots - apparently Spacenoids have forgotten how to build ocean-going mobile suits for use on Earth. The Capule remains in use with Zeon remnants and participates in attacks on the Federation capital Dakar and Australia`s Torrington Base in U.C. 0096.

<description>At the end of the One Year War, many Zeon remnants flee the Earth Sphere to the asteroid base Axis, determined to regroup and rebuild their forces before renewing their revolution against the Earth Federation. The MS-14A Gelgoog, the last mass production mobile suit fielded by the Zeon military during the war, has proven itself as an excellent high-performance unit. However, more powerful and advanced mobile suit technology is being developed in the Earth Sphere, and Axis has to keep up and train its pilots to handle better mobile suits. Thus, Axis upgrades its surviving Gelgoog units into the MS-14J Regelgu, with features like the new standard 360-degree panoramic cockpit. The Regelgu now sports large shoulder armor binders, each housing additional thrusters and verniers for extra speed and maneuverability. Two external propellant tanks are added to the backpack to provide an extended flight range on par with lighter and more modern mobile suits. A backpack missile pod, forearm grenade launchers, a pair of beam sabers and a beam rifle round out the armament. With these new features, the Regelgu is a tremendous improvement over its successful, tried-and-true previous form. Axis (later Neo Zeon) continues to use their ReGelgs for several years, with one unit operated by ace pilot Illia Pazom during the First Neo Zeon War in U.C. 0088.
