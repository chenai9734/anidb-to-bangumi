<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="521503">It is a good anime, with cool fights and funky music, although the manga beats it with story and character development by many miles. Could it be because this anime seems only loosly based? :) It starts of differently almost directly, and should be watched after reading the manga as a cool spinoff or what-if saga! I chose for fans, since on its own, without the manga, it would be a pretty generic anime :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="558382">This series fails in quality. Lots of static scenes while serious talks are delivered. No actual sword fights are in here, just shallow (static) images with bangs and then the monstrous enemies blow apart.

Still watchable as the story is interesting, although, I prefer to watch comedy samurai series like "Sengoku Otome; Momoiro Paradox" ten times rather than this once again. Just for fans.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="45349">Good action anime, with some decent plot, Generic story line with a couple of twists at the end&lt;br /&gt;nice swordplay in parts</recommendation>

<description>It is 1604, four years after the Battle of Sekigahara, perhaps Japan`s greatest civil war. The people try to recover from its aftermath and enjoy the newly attained peace. Amid such times Shiina Yuuya, a roughneck girl who earns money by capturing outlaws, mistakes a roaming and peace-loving medicine seller Mibu Kyoushiro for the legendary wanted man "Onime-no-Kyo." But she soon realizes that she is wrong when she sees that Kyoushiro is just a weakling. Nevertheless, she ends up capturing Kyoushiro anyway -- he is wanted for running off without paying for a meal. As they travel together Kyoushiro tries to help Yuuya catch another wanted criminal. In the process Kyoushiro is cornered. Then he mumbles, "Here he comes," and the color of his eyes turn a deep red. He pulls out his sword which he had never touched before and suddenly, Onime-no-Kyo, the legendary assassin said to have killed one thousand men with this sword, is standing there.
Kyoushiro and Kyou: Two spirits in one body. Yuuya is looking for a "man with a wound on his back" who killed her older brother. The two head to Edo together. One after another, samurai come after Onime-no-Kyo. Why do Kyoushiro and Kyou share the same body?</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>large breasts</name>
<description>Large breasts are breasts a fair notch larger than average, as found in some adolescent girls or fully grown women; however, as anime has no upper limit to breast size, the definition applies somewhat differently. To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>

<name>violent retribution for accidental infringement</name>
<description>A comedy / slapstick element often found in Ecchi anime: The hilarity derives from spontaneous embarrassment, overreaction of the "victim" (girl), immediate retribution for a seemingly inappropriate act, and a sense of pity with the supposed "aggressor" (boy).
Typically a boy will - through no fault of his own - stumble into a girl, thus invading her personal space. In the process the boy may e.g. pull down her skirt, grab the girl`s breasts, or accidentally kiss her. Any level-headed girl would see the accident just for what it is. Not so the girl with an overly developed sense of modesty, and a thing for violence. She - often a tsundere - will clobber the boy with excessive brutality.</description>

It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

It is a shady world, unknown to most people, where illegal things like murder, smuggling, drug dealing and similar are happening daily. Groups known to be acting in this world are for example the mafia or the yakuza.</description>

<description>Mibu Kyoushirou is a remarkable and mysterious swordsman, depicted as the only rival to Onime no Kyou (Demon Eyes Kyo). He wielded the Shibien (Black Sword), one of the Muramasa weapons. In the manga, he is depicted as one of the heirs to the Aka no Ou throne, the Red Eyes being proof of his Mibu lineage. He is a "Red Cross Knight", created from the flesh of the Sendai Aka no Ou. Though he is able to control the Red Eyes, he is not a true Mibu, but merely a more powerful battle doll resembling the first generation of battle dolls created. It is depicted that he is stronger than Demon Eyes Kyo until near the end of the manga.</description>

<description>Tokugawa Ieyasu is the father of Benitora and the daimyo of the Tokugawa clan. In the manga he is portrayed as a middle-aged man and a ruthless daimyo. He pretended to be Hattori Hanzo and used a double, a fat balding lieutenant of the Tokugawa clan, to play his role. Following the Shogun Tournament, he reveals himself to Kyou and the others. Later on in the story, he entrusts the Hokuraku Shimon to Benitora and helps Kyou defeat the former Crimson King.
In the anime, however, Ieyasu`s appearance is that of the double in the manga, and the Hattori Hanzo in the anime is the real Ieyasu himself in the manga. In the anime, Ieyasu is secretly being controlled by Santera, and eventually turns into a Kenyou which is killed by his son Hidetada.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Akira is the first member of the Shiseiten to appear in the story. He was a peasant boy whom Kyou found in a village that he completely destroyed. Though Akira was very young and the only survivor, he refused to cry and instead faced Kyou with the intention of fighting him. Kyou was impressed with Akira`s fighting spirit and adopted him, promising to make him the strongest man in the world - after Kyou, of course. He was nicknamed the Twin Headed Dragon for two reasons: one, because his techniques require two swords, called Chisakatana (小さ刀, lit. Small sword, one shorter than the second as noted by Saishi), and two, because of his two personalities. One moment he is docile, kind, and gentle, and in a flash, he is a blood-thirsty killer akin to Kyou himself. Akira was incapable of unlocking his full potential because he didn`t have samurai/noble blood, but he overcame this limitation by intentionally blinding himself. He gained the "eye of the heart", making him even more perceptive than those who can see.</description>

<description>Migeira is not featured in the manga. His weapon, one of the Five Muramasas, is a 5-barreled gun called the Hashagou that he wears on his right arm. Its ammunition seems to be his soul or spiritual power. Migeira says that the first Muramasa was taken to China, and changed by Western alchemists into the form of a gun that he later tracked down. He also has the ability to see "the future" (or more correctly, the proper timeline that historically "should" have happened) and belongs to Kyou no Miyako, a secret order dedicated to governing the path of history. Because Kyou inhabits a body with two souls, this has caused a disturbance in the time line that Migeira seeks to rectify. He seems nonchalant most of the time, but sometimes gives wise advice to the characters or speaks passionately about his own sense of justice.</description>

<description>Hotaru was a member of the five stars of the Mibu and was sent to spy on Kyou. He has great admiration for the blood-thirsty and icy Kyou and resents Kyou`s softer side that has developed by coming into contact with Yuya. He also resents his older half-brother Shinrei (another member of the five stars) due to the fact that Shinrei is the valued "wanted son" while he, Hotaru, is the illegitimate son of a concubine.
Despite Shinrei`s ignorance of the truth, Hotaru`s entire life seems centered around his animosity towards his brother. All he does is counter Shinrei. Where Shinrei uses water (their father being a Master of the Muryou Saikyou Ryuu School, the water school of the Mibu), Hotaru devotes himself to fire. Where Shinrei swore to uphold the honor and wishes of the Mibu Clan, Hotaru rebelled. Where Shinrei sought strength through friendship and camaraderie, Hotaru sought strength through solitude. This prompts him to battle his former allies, the Shiseiten and Kyou, because he believes that they stand between himself and the solitude needed for true strength.</description>

In truth, however, Kotarou was temporarily controlled by the real Indara who caused him to attack Sasuke. Sasuke defended himself, but all Kotarou remembered was Sasuke attacking him. Makora has the ability to control shadow forces and hide under them. His attack, Kageochi, makes an opponent drown in his own shadow. Nevertheless, he was finally defeated by Sasuke after realizing that Sasuke did not want to kill him. They made a pact of becoming good friends when they were still living in Aokigahara. Once he learned the truth, Kotarou protected Sasuke from Indara`s attack which ultimately killed him.
In the anime, Makora lives and joins Sanada Yukimura and Sasuke`s forces in their fight against Benitora and his forces.</description>

<description>In the past, when he belonged to the "Sanada Juuyuushi", Shindara was called Sarutobi Sasuke. After being informed of Yukimura`s premature death and his failure to seize hold of the country through the Taishirou Tokito`s predictions, he left the Sanada and joined the Mibu to spy on them and to save Yukimura`s life when the time comes. He is called the immortal one because Hishigi modified his body so he can regenerate instantaneously. He faces Yukimura and loses, but his motivation behind his betrayal is revealed. Later, he saves Sasuke from death and dies from mortal wounds beyond the healing capacity of his regeneration.
After Bikara died, Shindara looked after Antera and acted as her parent keeping her at his side at all times.</description>
