<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="158891">Not sure if this was worth the time after the series - it didn`t add anything new. It skipped the first half of R2, barely mentioning what has happened, and changed some minor character stories/outcomes as well. It`s mostly a recap that tunes the setting only slightly to leave space for the series to have a sequel as well. If you watch the series and then want to watch the 4th movie, the differences introduced by this can be described in a single phrase :-)</recommendation>

<description>The http://anidb.net/ch15617 [Holy Britannian Empire] is a powerful nation that uses its military strength to expand its rule, and the small island nation of Japan is yet another victim. During a worldwide conflict in 2010 known as the Second Pacific War, the once proud country was reduced to rubble and mockingly renamed to Area 11.
Koudou (Initiation)
However, one student plans to free Japan from http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]`s control through an extraordinary rebellion. His name is http://anidb.net/ch103 [Lelouch Lamperouge], and he is fueled with hatred for the Empire, plotting to wipe its accursed name off the face of the planet. Lelouch`s malicious plans are unexpectedly accelerated upon meeting the mysterious woman http://anidb.net/ch45 [C.C.], who grants him a supernatural ability known as "http://anidb.net/t2243 [Geass]" that makes anyone Lelouch commands unable to defy his will.
Now armed with a devastating power, Lelouch assumes the persona of http://anidb.net/ch1697 [Zero], a revolutionary figure who carries the hopes and dreams of the oppressed around the world. He vows to restore the glorious nation of Japan and deliver divine retribution to Britannia.
Handou (Transgression)
Having achieved miraculous victories in a series of battles against the Britannian Army, Lelouch Lamperouge has brought the http://anidb.net/ch2353 [Black Knights], his paramilitary organization, to a more powerful state than ever before. Nothing seems impossible for him when he utilizes his military strength, intellect, and Geass power of absolute obedience.
However, obstacles in the face of the uprising never cease, putting Lelouch in a difficult predicament. Most worryingly, http://anidb.net/ch338 [Kururugi Suzaku]`s combat prowess and the appearance of a mysterious child named http://anidb.net/ch15618 [V.V.] threaten to put an end Lelouch`s great rebellion.
Oudou (Glorification)
Lelouch Lamperouge`s dreams of destroying the Holy Britannian Empire are slowly crumbling. His sister, http://anidb.net/ch2000 [Nunnally], has been kidnapped by http://anidb.net/ch1999 [Schneizel el Britannia], and Kururugi Suzaku is ignoring his desperate pleas for assistance. The Black Knights are slowly losing faith in Lelouch as their leader, and the http://anidb.net/ch15673 [United Federation of Nations] has declared global war on Britannia.
Having suffered numerous betrayals, a significant loss of power, and an ever growing resentment towards Britannian Emperor http://anidb.net/ch10629 [Charles zi Britannia], the crippled Lelouch makes a final decision: if he can`t destroy the Empire from the outside, he will take it for himself from within.

<description>The military, also known as the armed forces, are forces authorized and legally entitled to use deadly force so as to support the interests of the state and its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its citizens and the prosecution of war against foreign powers. The military may also have additional functions within a society, including construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding critical areas.

<name>immortality</name>
<description>Immortality is the ability to live in a physical or spiritual form for an infinite or inconceivably vast length of time. Humans, whose life span is limited and who die of age, disease and external trauma, have long sought ways to extend their lives; the Epic of Gilgamesh, considered one of the first great literary works created by mankind, is primarily the quest of a hero seeking to become immortal. The advances of science, in particular medicine and engineering, and especially in the last few centuries, have helped people extend their life span and may yet continue finding ways to do so.
In fiction, immortals are not quite as uncommon as in real life, and the possible implications of endless or very long lives are often explored. Such implications include, but are not limited to: repeatedly accompanying the deaths of those dear to them; having to hide their condition from the mortals surrounding them; becoming disillusioned with their lives and being unable to kill themselves; and even staying forever trapped in the body of a specific physical age, that body most often being that of a child. As such, while many may wish for immortality, it may be little more than a curse for the few who have it.</description>

<name>cyborg</name>
<description>A cyborg is a cybernetic organism (i.e. an organism that has both artificial and natural systems). The term was coined in 1960 when Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline used it in an article about the advantages of self-regulating human-machine systems in outer space. D. S. Halacy`s Cyborg: Evolution of the Superman in 1965 featured an introduction which spoke of a "new frontier" that was "not merely space, but more profoundly the relationship between `inner space` to `outer space` -a bridge...between mind and matter." The cyborg is often seen today merely as an organism that has enhanced abilities due to technology, but this perhaps oversimplifies the category of feedback.
Fictional cyborgs are portrayed as a synthesis of organic and synthetic parts, and frequently pose the question of difference between human and machine as one concerned with morality, free will, and empathy. Fictional cyborgs may be represented as visibly mechanical (e.g. the Cybermen in the Doctor Who franchise or The Borg from Star Trek); or as almost indistinguishable from humans (e.g. the "Human" Cylons from the re-imagining of Battlestar Galactica). The 1970s television series The Six Million Dollar Man featured one of the most famous fictional cyborgs. Cyborgs in fiction often play up a human contempt for over-dependence on technology, particularly when used for war, and when used in ways that seem to threaten free will. Cyborgs are also often portrayed with physical or mental abilities far exceeding a human counterpart (military forms may have inbuilt weapons, among other things).
Real (as opposed to fictional) cyborgs are more frequently people who use cybernetic technology to repair or overcome the physical and mental constraints of their bodies. While cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals, they can be any kind of organism.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Even though school clubs in Japan are not mandatory, there is some pressure from the social grid (e.g. fellow students, teachers) to participate in some kind of after-school activity, be it in sports or arts. Colleges also have clubs.
As a comedy element in anime, some students have joined too many clubs, and are thus constantly stressed out. There is also the element of social commentary, making it clear that you have to join a club, if you want to be part of the class. Since self-founded clubs need at least 3 members, the desperate search and advertising for new members can be cause for hilarity in anime.</description>

<name>thriller</name>
<description>The thriller is a genre of fiction in which tough, resourceful, but essentially ordinary heroes are pitted against villains determined to destroy them, their country, or the stability of the free world. The hero of a typical thriller faces danger alone or in the company of a small band of companions. The protagonist may be a law enforcement agent, a journalist, or a soldier, but typically he or she is cut off from the resources of "their" organization. More often the hero is an ordinary citizen drawn into danger and intrigue by circumstances beyond their control.

<name>racism</name>
<description>Racism is prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of an ethnically different background based on the pseudo-scientific belief that biological differences between peoples form so-called "races" and that one`s own "race" is superior to another, possibly also holding that members of different "races" should be treated differently. Some definitions include only consciously malignant forms of discrimination, and some views include discriminatory behaviors and beliefs based on cultural, national, ethnic, caste, or religious stereotypes. In works of fiction, this may also include similar actions against other sentient species.

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<name>talking is a free action</name>
<description>Time in comics is flexible. Each panel shows a single event, which is usually accompanied by a length of dialog, which must take some time to say. This disparity is usually accepted if it isn`t taken to extremes.
But often, characters will exposit when it`s most needed: at the story`s climax, when both the intricacies of the plot and the intensity of action hit their highest.
While the Heroes Outrun the Fireball, Mr. Exposition might explain why the Evil Overlord`s death caused the explosion. The Action Girl can deliver impressive lectures on why the monster`s Achilles` Heel will work, while still engaging in Waif-Fu. The Superhero can quip to his heart`s content and explain his abilities while dueling one insignificant mobster, or deliver a Kirk Summation during the course of a single Finishing Move. Sometimes even apparent mere mortals can give a lecture on what is happening when it would be a much better idea to simply run like hell.
Without stopping to breathe, apparently.

<description>Rebellion, uprising, or insurrection is a refusal of obedience or order. It may, therefore, be seen as encompassing a range of behaviors aimed at destroying or taking over the position of an established authority such as a government, governor, president, political leader, financial institution, or person in charge. On the one hand the forms of behaviour can include non-violent methods such as the (overlapping but not quite identical) phenomena of civil disobedience, civil resistance and nonviolent resistance. On the other hand it may encompass violent campaigns. Those who participate in rebellions, especially if they are armed rebellions, are known as "rebels".&#13;

<description>A term usually used to describe a situation, where a seemingly smart and cunning villain sets up a plan that seems grand and impressive, but is actually long winding, ridiculous, and convoluted. And all of that just to trick his opponent(s), like the hero or anybody else, into doing things exactly as he planned. Suffice to say that the villain could have reached his goal by much shorter and easier means, it just wouldn`t seem as awesome anymore.
The phrase is also known as the original Japanese "keikaku doori" where keikaku stands translated for "plan" or "schedule", and doori for "in accordance with ..." or "following ...".
The phrase is a reference to http://anidb.net/ch301 [Yagami Light] from http://anidb.net/a4563 [Death Note], and his love for plans.</description>

<name>Kouzuki Kallen</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kallen Stadtfeld is a Britannian-Japanese girl, who believes herself to be a Japanese person at heart and prefers to be known by her birth name, Kouzuki. Her father is Britannian and her mother is an Eleven; her father comes from a prestigious Britannian family, which Kallen benefits from. Her brother, Naoto Kouzuki, with whom she had a deep connection, was a former leader of her resistance cell before his death.
Kallen is a highly-skilled Knightmare Frame pilot, rivaling the abilities of even the Knights of the Round. She is acknowledged as the best pilot of the Black Knights by enemies and allies alike. Her codename, "Q-1," is the Queen`s starting spot in descriptive chess notation. In Lelouch`s assessment of the core members of the Black Knights, her "Combat Ability" score is 100 out of 100, matching that of Kyoshiro Tohdoh; she also has the highest possible "Loyalty" score of 100.
Even when piloting outdated Knightmare Frames such as the Glasgow, Kallen proves to be a dangerous opponent easily defeating numerous Sutherlands, despite the Sutherland being a more advanced Knightmare. With the radiation arm of her Guren Mk-II, Kallen can take down almost any Knightmare Frame in a single attack should they allow her to make physical contact, and later models also have numerous secondary attack modes for mid- and long-range combat. Her Knightmare Frame is also incredibly fast, allowing her to fight on the same level as some of the most advanced Knightmare Frames in the series.
Outside of a Knightmare, Kallen displays superior fighting abilities. She is nimble enough to swat a bee with a single swipe (and cut it in half), and on two occasions she defeats numerous armed men with little trouble. She is also apparently intelligent, since her grades in school are top of the class despite frequent absences.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Shortly after gaining the power of Geass from C.C., Lelouch assumes the secret identity Zero, a mysterious, masked revolutionary dressed in a black helmet and cloak. The helmet has a retractable plate over the left eye so Lelouch can use his Geass. In this guise, he forms the Order of the Black Knights, initially composed of the members of Kaname Ohgi`s resistance group. The goal of this vigilante group is a campaign against powerful individuals who oppress the helpless, which he eventually expands into reforming Japan as an independent nation.</description>

<name>Schneizel el Britannia</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Schneizel el Britannia is the Second Prince of the Holy Britannian Empire and the Prime Minister of Britannia. He is one of the primary antagonists of the series and a strategist on par with Lelouch, as he is the only person whom Lelouch was unable to beat in chess as a child. Schneizel is ruthless and cold as a strategist, willing to sacrifice lives without a second thought to achieve his ends, but he is also very charismatic and caring toward his subordinates. He seems to show disdain for force when it is unnecessary, as he negotiates a peace treaty with the Euro Universe despite dominating them in every military engagement.
When Lelouch becomes Britannia`s 99th Emperor, Schneizel, alongside the Black Knights and other soldiers opposing Lelouch, confront him. Upon Schneizel`s defeat, Lelouch uses his Geass on him to make him follow Zero`s orders, having anticipated that Suzaku would take on the persona after Lelouch dies.</description>

Lelouch believes that she may be able to see again someday. After the confrontation between Lelouch and the Emperor of Britannia about the murder of their mother, both Lelouch and Nunnally were exiled to Japan as political prisoners.</description>

<name>Charles zi Britannia</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Charles zi Britannia, at first only referred to as The Emperor of Britannia (ブリタニア皇帝, Britannia Koutei), born August 4, 1955 a.t.b., is Lelouch`s father and the 98th Emperor of the Holy Britannian Empire as well as one of the main antagonists of the series. He has 108 different consorts. A strong proponent of Social Darwinism, he views equality as an evil that must be dispelled, and to this end he encourages class conflict and military expansionism so as to maintain social evolution and progress. He also suffered a horrific childhood of his family murdering each other for succession, forging a pact with his brother V.V. to create a world without lies. Acquiring allies in Marianne and C.C., Charles created the Sword of Akasha, a weapon designed to facilitate the Ragnarök Connection, remaking the world into a place without lies by killing "God", which is the collective individual unconsciousness of all mankind.
However, when V.V. murdered Marianne and denied his part in her death, Charles was forced to alter the memories of Nunnally before sending her and Lelouch to Japan as political hostages during the sakuradite conflict. Since then, the Emperor focused more on his goals while having his remaining children deal with Britannian matters. Eventually after taking V.V.`s code to become immortal, Charles starts up the final preparations of the Ragnarök connection, revealing the entire truth and that C.C.`s code is the last piece to complete the plan. However, Lelouch sees Charles` ideal world to be nothing more than stagnation that would doom mankind rather than save it, and he uses his Geass to break collective unconsciousness from the connection while having his father dissolve into nothingness. With his last breath, Charles warns Lelouch his rejection of the world he envisioned would only allow Schneizel`s to become a reality.
The Emperor initially possesses a Geass power given to him by V.V. which allows him to suppress memories and create false ones through eye contact. It can also suppress the Geass power of the target, even if it is permanently active. This power, however, is not unbreakable. A victim`s true memories can be supplied by someone else or recalled by extraordinary force of will; doing so will break the Geass and restore any Geass the victim may possess. It can also be broken with a Geass Canceler. During Lelouch`s assault on the Geass Order, he takes on V.V.`s "Code," exchanging his Geass for immortality. The Code mark is situated on his right palm.</description>

<name>Ougi Kaname</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Ougi Kaname is the leader of the original resistance cell. He took over leadership following the death of Kallen`s older brother, Kouzuki Naoto (紅月ナオト), leaving his teaching job to do so. He is a somewhat reserved individual who lacks self-confidence, often questioning his ability to lead. However, he is also fairly perceptive, recognizing Zero`s intentions to a degree and even deducing some of the things he keeps secret from the organization. Kaname turns over leadership of his resistance cell to Zero after Zero proves himself the more competent and effective commander. When Zero reorganizes the Black Knights, he appoints Ohgi as deputy commander.
Following a battle in which the Japan Liberation Front is all but wiped out, Ohgi finds Villetta Nu left for dead at a ship dock. He nurses her back to health, and lets her live with him when she cannot remember who she is. Though he knows she has seen Zero`s face (Villetta having said so when he recovered her), he cannot bring himself to kill her or use Refrain to recover her memories. Over time, he falls in love with her. During the Black Rebellion, Ohgi is shot by Villetta, who has regained her memories.
Despite being captured in the Black Rebellion, Ohgi maintains his faith in Zero, knowing that Zero alone can liberate Japan. During the opening ceremony for the second Special Administration Region in Japan, he prevents Villetta from being shot. She suspects it is him, but he doesn`t confirm her suspicions and bids her farewell. Later, Villetta arranges a meeting with Ohgi, intending to kill him to erase her links to the Elevens. Ohgi comes knowing full well what she intends to do, and confesses his love for her. Villetta is captured during an altercation with Sayoko and held hostage by Diethard to ensure Ohgi`s loyalty, but is set free shortly after the second battle of Tokyo is cut short. She and Ohgi help convince the leaders of the Black Knights that Schneizel`s claims are valid. However, Ohgi adamantly insists that Japan be freed if they betray Zero, feeling that he couldn`t forgive himself if any less came of it. Diethard notes that it is in Ohgi`s nature to protect, not lead, and considers his new leadership role a "miscast." During the battle against Lelouch, he has Villetta stay on Horai Island, telling her that he was the first to acknowledge Lelouch and that he doesn`t want to get new lives involved, as she is pregnant. He marries Villetta at the end of the series, and is elected Prime Minister of Japan.</description>

<name>Tamaki Shin`ichirou</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Tamaki Shin`ichirou is the leader of the second special squadron of the Black Knights. He is hot-headed, carefree and the self-proclaimed best friend of Zero, quick to cheer others on when not doing the fighting but rash and impulsive when he`s on the front lines. His rashness is shown to border on recklessness, as he orders the execution of the Ashford Academy student council against Zero`s wishes, though extenuating circumstances prevent his orders from being carried out. He pilots a standard Knightmare during battles, but is rather inept at that; his frame is the first to be destroyed by Suzaku`s Lancelot in the first season and in all encounters after that, Tamaki is rather comically dispatched very early in battle, which ends up hurting his pride in the end of the second season (the only time Suzaku needs more than one strike to defeat him).
Tamaki dreams of being a bureaucrat, and states that if he didn`t have his dream to aim for, he would probably have become a Refrain user. He is initially skeptical about Zero, but comes to be one of his most vehement supporters, particularly after the Specially Administrated Zone of Japan fails. Even after being captured and imprisoned for a year following the failed Black Rebellion, he never gives up hope that Zero will rescue them, despite the fact that Zero was reported as dead.
Tamaki seems to be the most critical of C.C.`s involvement in the organization during the first season, due to her lack of an official position, and accuses her of being Zero`s lover. In the second season, this appears to have been lightened into simple back and forth banter. Tamaki also complains about his own lack of an official position in the second season (what happened to his old position is not revealed), wanting to be in charge of finances in some way (Lelouch relieved him of this responsibility early in the first season when he spent much of their money on frivolous dinners for recruiting). With the formation of the United Federation of Nations and the Black Knights` appointment as its unified army, Tamaki is made the Internal Cleaning Supporter. When Lelouch is exposed as Zero, Tamaki takes it the hardest, being the last to accept that Zero could have manipulated them all this time. At the end of the series, Tamaki opens his own bistro alongside Sugiyama, Minami, and Villetta and is last seen standing right next to Ohgi in Ohgi and Villetta`s wedding picture.</description>

She also acts as Lloyd`s conscience, not hesitating to scold him or physically punish him for his unintentionally rude remarks or treating Suzaku as a "part". Cécile is a capable Knightmare Frame pilot, managing to single-handedly hold the entire contingent of Black Knights sent to occupy Ashford Academy during the Black Rebellion at bay using a Sutherland modified with equipment from the Lancelot. Prior to joining Lloyd in the military, she studied at the Imperial Colchester Institute.[4] Following Lelouch`s ascension to the throne, she follows Lloyd and Suzaku and willingly accepts Lelouch as the new emperor. A recurring joke is that Cécile is a bad cook, though no one has the heart to tell her; her recipes include onigiri mixed with blueberry jam and sandwiches made with ginger, sugar and wasabi.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Diethard Ried is the head of information, espionage, and public relations for the Black Knights. A graduate of the Imperial Britannia Central University`s Faculty of Law, Diethard is a former producer and member of the press staff at Hi-TV, a Britannian television station. Following the appearance of Zero and the announcement of his goals, Diethard joins the Black Knights, wishing to witness and document Zero`s campaign to overthrow Britannia. Like Kallen Stadtfeld, he shows fierce loyalty to Zero, whom he views as his source of inspiration. He harbors contempt for the Britannian Imperial Family and its supporters, on occasion commenting to Rakshata Chawla that "Britannia is a finished product" and that he would rather take part in creating something new.
Diethard has proven himself to be highly perceptive, easily picking up on the likely outcomes of Zero`s plans. He recognizes immediately that Zero is responsible for the destruction of the Japan Liberation Front`s tanker ship, a fact of which Zero never made the organization aware. However, this same trait also causes him to overreach himself, most evident in his ordering an assassination attempt on Suzaku Kururugi after being instructed otherwise by Zero. When Kallen wonders if he can be trusted, Lelouch replies that Diethard is dedicated to making Zero a god, which makes him predictable and thus easy to control.
Despite possessing some knowledge of who Lelouch is and of his power, Diethard remains loyal. Only when Lelouch is exposed in front of the leaders of the Black Knights does he finally betray him. He claims that he would rather have watched Zero topple Britannia, but will settle for a hero`s death instead. When finding Lelouch proves difficult following his escape, Diethard suggests reporting him as dead, noting that even if Zero came back he would have no credibility without support. He defects to Schneizel following this, deciding that Schneizel and his plans are more interesting than Zero`s. When Schneizel is placed under Lelouch`s control, Diethard flies into a rage, holding Lelouch at gunpoint and claiming that Zero`s story is dead. Schneizel shoots him in the heart before he can pull the trigger. In his dying moments, Diethard asks Lelouch to use his Geass to kill him, to which Lelouch responds that Diethard isn`t worthy of having a Geass order cast upon him.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Lloyd Asplund is an earl of the Britannian nobility and the head of the scientific research team Camelot, which is responsible for the development of the elite Knightmare Frame Lancelot. To keep from being reminded of the fragility of human lives and friendship, Lloyd immerses himself in science and comes to view people as nothing more than tools — he regards Suzaku, for example, as a mere component of the machine that he pilots. He has a tendency to mock others and is often rebuked for this behavior by Cécile Croomy, his assistant. Prior to joining the military, he attended the Imperial Colchester Institute.[4] Lloyd`s research organization, Camelot (キャメロット?), is an irregular division of the Britannian Military that has permission from Prince Schneizel to operate outside the command structure and regulations of the regular Britannian armed forces.
Rakshata refers to Lloyd as the Earl of Pudding (プリン伯爵?), as pudding is his favorite food. He is engaged to Milly Ashford in the first season, having agreed to the union mostly in the hope that he might obtain the designs of the Knightmare Frame Ganymede. As such, he is forced into doing nice things for her by Suzaku, though Milly breaks off the engagement after she graduates in order to become more true to herself.
After the second battle of Tokyo, he is confronted by a distraught Nina after she realizes the fatalities caused by her F.L.E.I.J.A. Lloyd tells her that she has to make a choice between saving her heart and morals or discard them for science. When asked by Nina if he had already made that choice, he replies that he never had such a problem due to himself being a sociopath. He willingly joins Lelouch`s new regime, remarking that he and Cécile have become "parts" without ever realizing it. He and Cecile are among the few who know the details of the "Zero Requiem", Lelouch`s plan to unite the world. He expresses an interest in studying Lelouch`s Geass, but he is warned off by Jeremiah. He works with Nina and Cécile to create a countermeasure to F.L.E.I.J.A. and assists Sayoko during the rescue of the hostages on board the Avalon (as ordered by Lelouch). He and Cécile are last seen in Ohgi and Villetta`s wedding picture.</description>
