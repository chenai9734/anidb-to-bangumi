<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<description>The anime will fit this category if some or all of the action takes place on another planet which is supposedly in the same universe as Earth, not a complete fantasy world; usually there has to be some concept of space travel. The Latin name for Earth - Terra, would also pass the condition of being in the same universe as Earth. Basically, even mentioning of Earth existing or having existed would be enough.

<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>space opera</name>
<description>Space opera is a sub-genre of fiction that emphasizes romantic adventures in space. Space opera generally involves large-scale conflicts between opponents with powerful abilities and technology. The genre will often be melodramatic, sometimes playing music that can be nothing short of awesome. Warfare and a battle of wits are usually less emphasized, preferring romance (with exceptions, e.g. Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu). Some space operas tend to be formulaic and sometimes even prosaic, often employing very simple devices and somewhat obvious strategies. An example of this would be the infamous laws of physics in the Macross universe, in which the main male lead will hardly ever get hit in battle.</description>

She meets the child Basara as he gives her some food (which he had gotten by initially trying to trade his guitar to a baker, who just gave him the bread because he liked Basara`s music).

This plan comes to the fore when he learns that the singing of Anima Spiritia, and in particular the band http://anidb.net/ch49391 [Fire Bomber], causes humans to regenerate their spiritia: he lures first the Macross 5 and then the Macross 7 fleets to an Earth-like planet (dubbed Lux by the crew of the former fleet), intending to trap and corral them there. Although the planet is ultimately destroyed, he has by this time transported the citizens of Macross 5 back to Varauta IV, intending to capture and use the band to create an endless supply of spiritia.Source: wiki</description>

<description>The Uraga Class Escort Battle Carrier is the next generation stealth carrier built to replace the Guantánamo Class Stealth Carriers. The Uraga Class, built with weaponry, armor and maneuverability comparable to a cruiser, is often used as the flagship of small fleets. At 550 meters long, the Uraga Class ships are much larger conventional spacecraft but still significantly smaller than the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] or the later New Macross Class ships. The Uraga is built with a stealth composition and features a dual deck launching system for variable fighters; one deck running the latter dorsal two-thirds of the ship and an internal deck underneath with a launching deck in the forward third. This efficient deck design allows rapid deployment of multiple craft simultaneously and has become common on many UN Spacy carrier vessels.
These ships are rare among colonization fleets due to their high costs compared to the http://anidb.net/ch48791 [ARMD] carriers but the UNG remains committed to replacing the older http://anidb.net/ch48791 [ARMD] carriers one by one with Uraga Class vessels. As more Uraga Class Escort Battle Carriers are built, they are poised to become the mainstay combat and carrier ship for the UN Spacy. Many Uraga Class vessels are part of Earth`s defense fleet in 2040 and are found serving as command ships for large groups of Guantánamo Class Stealth Carriers and Stealth Frigates. Several Uraga Class Escort Battle Carriers are also in active service with the 37th Long-Distance Colonization Fleet, serving as defensive stations docked to unarmed core ships such as the Riviera and Hollywood.

<description>In the years following Space War I, the United Nations Government (UNG) quickly rebuilt much of the lost infrastructure and soon the UN Spacy was rebuilding the fleet. Impressed with the initial combat performance and multi-functionality of the http://anidb.net/ch48791 [ARMD] Class Space Carriers, the UN Spacy pursued design and construction of a next generation http://anidb.net/ch48791 [ARMD] Class vessel. The result is the Guantánamo Class Stealth Carrier, an improved space carrier with stealth capabilities and its own Space Fold System for interstellar travel. As a carrier, the Guantánamo Class has a large launch bay in the forward section, a dock in the aft section of the ship (to link with large vessels) and large external fuel tanks with stealth covers. Though this class of vessel utilized many new technologies, the economy of design proved relatively inexpensive and the UN Spacy deployed massive numbers of Guantánamo Stealth Carriers. These ships are found primarily as the main-force carrier in the colonization fleets, but the Guantánamo Class Stealth Carrier is also used extensively for planetary defense. In 2040, Earth has a vast defense fleet stationed in orbit consisting of numerous vessels that included the Guantánamo Class ships as well as thousands of armed defense satellites spread amongst the fleet.

<description>The smallest of the UN Spacy ships of the line, the Northampton Class Stealth Frigate is an easily constructed vessel and functions as the main-force warship for colonization fleets. The main engines are built around the center circumference of the rear hull and supply the 250-meter long frigate with excellent speed and maneuverability that compensates for a lack of heavy firepower. Like many of the next generation space vessels of the UNG, the stealth frigate features a stealth composition and functions as a carrier ship for variable fighters. In battle the stealth frigate utilizes several concealed launch bays for the fighters and has several anti-ship missile launchers and converging energy beam cannons. The widespread use of this class has lead to the deployment of numerous modified Bolognese frigates such as firepower-enhanced, reconnaissance and early-warning variants. The stealth frigates have also been adopted by Zentradi crews and these ships feature more Zentradi technology with distinctive hull designs. The stealth frigate fulfill a primary operational role and thus there are large numbers of these ships serving in the UN Spacy fleets, from planetary defense around Earth to far reaching colony fleets like the 37th long-distance colonization fleet. Stealth Frigates serve as the first defensive line in the emigration fleets, with aircraft carriers forming the second defense line. Additionally, a squadron of stealth frigates will operate as "pilot fish" for surveying routes and securing supplies ahead of a emigration fleet.

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>In the mid 2020`s the U.N.G. was already invested in the development of the VF-11 Thunderbolt, but motivation was high for the continuing innovation of new OverTechnology applications in the hopes of building even better variable fighter craft. Ever a company known for pushing the envelope, General Galaxy was contracted by the U.N.G. to build a different type of variable mecha and thus began the development of the VF-17 Nightmare in 2026. While the VF-11 took first flight after only six years of design, the complicated and exacting research of the VF-17 didn`t produce a viable craft until the variable fighter`s first flight 2035. With the success of the flight tests, the U.N. Spacy adopted the VF-17 as a second line variable mecha and included squadrons on many of the colonization fleets, notably the 37th long-distance colonization fleet lead by the 7th Battle Class Stealth Space Attack Carrier in 2038.
The VF-17 Nightmare is a radically different variable fighter than previous generations, featuring completely new wing and transformation systems. Primarily designed as a special operations variable fighter and heavy battroid, the VF-17 is both larger and heavier than most other valkyries and features minimal atmospheric control surfaces subsequent to its primary role as a space fighter. To offset the nearly 12 ton weight, the VF-17 operates two extremely powerful Shinnakasu Heavy Industry/P&amp;W/Roice FF-2100X thermonuclear turbine engines with over twice as much thrust as the VF-11B. These incredibly powerful engines produce enough thrust for the VF-17 to achieve orbit unaided (the first production model variable fighter to do so) while also making the craft an ideal space superiority fighter. In addition to these powerful flight characteristics, the Nightmare is also designed as a stealth mecha and utilizes internally stored weaponry. As was typical following the success of a variable fighter, the VF-17 was eventually fitted with several equipment packages from Radomes and Fold Boosters to customized weaponry and Super Pack systems (though the VF-17 generally avoides the use of Super Parts and external weapons to maintain passive stealth capabilities).
The VF-17 was built in several different versions, but the VF-17D in service during the early 2040`s is the most distinguished model. Notable U.N. Spacy pilot http://anidb.net/ch41155 [Gamlin Kizaki] piloted a VF-17D Nightmare during his service in Macross 7`s elite unit Diamond Force until his promotion to Full Lieutenant when he was assigned a VF-17S. It was originally the intention of the UN Spacy that the VF-17 Nightmare be replaced as the primary special operations fighter of the UN Spacy by the VF-22S Sturmvogel II, also a General Galaxy design. However, by 2050`s the UN Spacy itself would undergo organizational changes as the New UN Spacy (NUNS) and priorities would also change. General Galaxy redesigned the VF-17 Nightmare into the VF-171 Nightmare Plus, a new main fighter/bomber for the New UN Spacy forces (circa 2059).

<description>The colonization of space that began in 2012, though initially beset by misfortune, was proving largely successful for the human race. Mass cloning provided significant population growth and the Megaroad Class ships were regularly carrying colonists to inhabit planets in the far reaches of space. Eventually, the growth of both the population and resources of the United Nations Government (UNG) demanded larger, more sophisticated ships to continue the colonization of space. The New Macross Class Super-Massive Colonization Battleships were designed and constructed. In 2030, the next major colonization fleet departed for the unknown with the first New Macross Class ship in command. With a total fleet population of over one million people, these massive colony fleets would quickly become the standard for the new wave of space colonization in the 2030`s.
The Battle Class Stealth Space Attack Carrier vessels are designed primarily as flagships for super-long-distance colonization fleets. Though armed for heavy anti-ship combat the primary role of the Battle Class is acting as mobile command center and the largest spacecraft/aircraft carrier in the fleet. The powerful main gun is a super beam weapon built as a mobile gunship separable from the ventral hull of the ship. The gunship is built with its own reactor and is capable of independent navigation if required. Like the SDF-1 Macross Class Super Dimension Fortress ships that preceded them, the Battle Class vessels are fully transformable ships that can convert into a humanoid-shaped Attack mode. The main gun is supplemented with four beam cannons but no additional turret weapons or missile launchers are found in most ships of this class. The Battle Class instead carries a large number of over 700 variable fighters, attack craft and bombers that can engage enemy fleets and any enemy attack craft. For rapid deployment of all aerospace craft, the Battle Class has twelve total standard catapults; six on the forward deck, three on the center deck and three on the aft port side angled deck. The ship is also equipped with three additional electromagnetic catapults and a command liaison hatch mounted just forward of the main bridge for immediately launching interceptor-fighters (typically VF-17D Nightmare fighters). For defense, the Battle Class has a pin-point barrier system and a short range full barrier system to defeat incoming enemy fire. In accordance with UN Spacy military doctrine for all ships of the line, the Battle Class has a stealth composition.
The City Class ships are designed as the super-long-distance colonization vessels of the New Macross Class. These ships almost always remained docked to the Battle Class vessels except in time of battle when the carrier will detach from the power plant docking unit mounted at the fore of the City ship. Inside the City Class ships is a fully functional city of roughly 350,000 people beneath the main dome. Outside the main city dome there is docking bay island (approximately 300 meters long) and the event dome. The City ships are powered by a separate reactor and even feature a basic space fold system for short-range interstellar travel. The City Class ships have no weapons and the City ship docked with the first Battle Class, Macross 1, had no defensive system. However, later City Class ships are all designed with a defensive shell that covers the city section of the craft in times of emergency (though both docking bay island and the event domes remain uncovered by the shell).
Perhaps the most distinguished of this ship class is the Macross 7 of the 37th long-distance colonization fleet that took part in the Protodeviln War in 2045. The 37th long-distance colonization fleet consisted of 1 x Battle 7/City 7 (Macross 7), 1 x Einstein Research Experimental Ship, 1 x Hollywood Amusement Ship, 1 x Riviera Resort Ship, 1 x Sunnyflower Agricultural Ship, 1 x Three Star Factory Ship, 1 x West Point Class Macro-Training Base Ship, one or more Mark Twain VII Resort Ships, 45 x Guantánamo Class Stealth Carriers (for use in space), 20 x Uraga Class Escort Battle Carriers (for use in air and space) and lastly 120 x Northampton Class Stealth Frigates (for use in air and space). The ship-carried aircraft/spacecraft for the entire fleet consisted of approximately 1,800 x variable fighters (mostly VF-11C Thunderbolts), 600 x variable attack craft, 9 x variable bombers, 120 x electronic reconnaisance fighters, 60 x cargo plane/freight transports and 100 x liason craft. Total fleet count is 194 large ships and 2,689 small craft. Commanded by Maximillian Jenius, the Battle 7 participated in numerous engagements against the Varauta Army throughout the war. Both the crew of the Battle 7 and the colonists of City 7 worked together during the ProtodevilnWar to develop a highly specialized sound technology that was used by several City 7 citizens to combat the Protodevlin. The infamous variable fighter unit Sound Force was stationed onboard the Macross 7 and the pilots - who together formed the rock band Fire Bomber - lived in the "Akusho" (or Acshio) area, the docking bay island section of City 7.

<description>As the main variable fighter of the U.N. Spacy in 2038, numerous VF-11C Thunderbolts are stationed aboard the 37th long-distance colonization fleet as it is lead by the 7th New Macross class battleship. This version of the Thunderbolt variable fighter features enhanced navigational electronic equipment (this upgrade was eventually installed in all VF-11 fighters from 2040 onward, starting with the first squadron). In 2045 the VF-11C squadrons are deployed in combat regularly since the outbreak of hostilities against the Varauta. Originally the VF-11C benefited from improved safety features which jettisoned the entire cockpit section of the craft in the event of the variable fighter`s destruction. However, this feature has not improved pilot safety in combat against the Varauta and many ejected pilots find themselves subjected to the Spiritia draining weaponry of Varauta mecha. Nonetheless, the VF-11C remains the backbone of the UNS forces for deep space colonization fleets. With hulls painted in bright blue-white, the VF-11C variable fighters of the Macross 7 fleet serve with distinction under command of Captain Maximilian Jenius.

<description>The colony ships that pioneered the great migration into space eventually grew into entire fleets of vessels with populations in excess of a million people. As the size of these colonization fleets increased the time spent traveling through space became a more important consideration for the effect upon the populace. Specialized vessels were built to help fulfill the needs of the colonists who could be traveling to habitable planets for years before settling. The Riviera Resort Ships were designed as vacation vessels, with hotels and casinos for high-class leisure. These large spaceships are over 6 kilometers long and are designed for marine life cultivation and breeding. Underneath a massive transparent dome an artificial 3.6km diameter ocean has been built with a coastline over 10 kilometers long. The forward section includes a large starport for visiting craft and numerous searchlights dot the exterior hull.
As large and important vessels carrying some 100,000 people, the Riviera ships feature defensive options to be used in the event of an emergency. The transparent dome can be covered with an armored shell to protect the population inside and the forward section of the ship is built with a dock to accommodate an Uraga Class Escort Battle Carrier. When the 7th New Macross-Class battleship departed with the 37th long-distance colonization fleet in 2038, a Riviera Resort Ship was among the vessels under its command. The Riviera was also part of the Milky Road inter-ship network which helped ferry small passenger and transport ships in between the vessels of the fleet.

<description>Guvava is a Gyarashi from the planet Pukirases V. He is an intelligent rodent whose fur is so thick he resembles a tribble with eyes. He also has a tail, which he can use to swing and propel himself with, and short legs. Guvava was rescued from his predator-rich environment by Maximilian Jenius in 2036, who found him injured and alone while on a mission. Upon returning home, Max gave him to his youngest daughter, Mylene, to care for. Mylene, then five years old, immediately fell in love with Guvava and helped nurse him back to health. Though Guvava was initially withdrawn, Mylene always stayed close to him, taking him with her almost everywhere, even to school, and the two soon became good friends. Guvava grew to become fiercely devoted to his "mistress" and can often be seen perching on her shoulder. He is telepathically linked to her and can seek her out when they are separated, and understand her speech, though he can only communicate in squeaks. In the presence of danger he rears up, his fur developing angry spikes, and he will even leap to attack if provoked. During Macross 7, set nine years later (in 2045-46), Mylene and Guvava are almost always together, even during concerts and space battles. Mylene states that Guvava is not simply a pet but rather, is a part of herself and she cares for him as much as she does for her human/Zentraedi friends and family.
Despite his small size, Guvava helps to protect Mylene as much as Mylene protects him. In episode 12 of Macross 7, Mylene is kidnapped by infiltration agents of the protodeviln. Guvava uses his telepathic ability to transmit Basara`s music to her and she begins to sing. Guvava is then able to lead Basara and Ray to her location. In Macross Dynamite 7, Mylene is invited to dinner by a woman who works to promote her music. However, the woman secretly drugs Mylene with the intention of sexually molesting her. Guvava immediately runs off to alert Mylene`s friends, Veffidas and Ray, who quickly arrive and smash their way into the room to save Mylene. Ray later states that if it hadn`t been for Guvava, the woman would have likely succeeded in forcing herself on Mylene.

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>The VF-19 Custom is a remodeled unit that was utilized for preliminary testing preceding the adoption of the mass production model VF-19 Excalibur. A goal of the VF-19 Custom was emphasis on maneuverability and stability in contrast to that of the original YF-19 prototype. The VF-19 Custom featured a modified version of the prototype fuselage that balance the high performance inherited from the original unit. The VF-19 aimed to improve the balance by reworking the fuselage structure, but the VF-19 Custom daringly maintains high maneuverability by following the original YF-19 concept. However, it was "singing" that characterized the principal objective of the VF-19 Custom far more than the outstanding operating performance. The craft was entrusted to Basara Nekki of the rock group "Fire Bomber" through Ray Lovelock. Granting operation of the VF-19 Custom to Basara and Lovelock was for the purpose of verifying application of the craft to the top-secret military program "Project M", aimed researching song energy. On the battlefield the VF-19 Custom would bask in the media limelight. Behind the scenes, the military operated data collection on the VF-19 Custom and the craft was supported by the military via thorough maintenance.
On board the Macross 7 fleet in 2045, a special paramilitary unit made use of a customized VF-19 variable fighter with a bright red colored hull. This VF-19 Custom was built by the UN Forces and given to Ray Lovelock as part of Operation M, a classified mission to test the combat effects of culture via music upon a potential enemy. The unduly decorative design matches the brashness and audacity of Nekki Basara, the singer/pilot assigned to the VF-19 by Lovelock. The VF-19 Custom features minimal offensive weaponry and is armed with only a pair of laser cannons (mounted in the wing roots) and two internal missile launch systems (mounted in the engines/lower legs). The primary armament of the VF-19 Custom is an external speaker-pod-firing launcher pod with sensor, fore grip and stock magazine (mounted on ventral fuselage section in Fighter mode or in manipulator in GERWALK and Battroid mode). The shoulders/dorsal engine nacelles have installed audio and speaker systems as well as lightup projector systems. With the launcher pod and sound systems, Basara fires armor-penetrating speaker-pods into enemy mecha and directly transmits his music to the enemy pilots inside. For defense, the VF-19 Custom features a pin-point barrier system like all VF-19 variable fighters. The cockpit of the VF-19 Custom is redesigned to utilize a non-conventional control stick resembling a guitar, an instrument that singer/pilot Nekki Basara manipulates skillfully to operate the myriad controls of the variable fighter in combat.
The VF-19 Custom was originally intended as a first strike weapon for use against non-cultured Zentradi still engaged in hostilities across the galaxy with the Supervision Army. With this variable fighter, the UN Forces could directly assault and confuse the Zentradi forces by exposing them to culture through music, a completely foreign experience that proved very disruptive to their strictly military life. However, the VF-19 Custom and Nekki Basara in particular played a much larger role during the Protodeviln War in 2045. The Varauta Army consisted largely of brainwashed humans and Zentradi of Earth origin as well as Protodeviln possessing humans directly. The Protodeviln and their Varauta Army were vulnerable to particularly high intensity sound energy produced by certain individuals via life energy called Spiritia. These individuals, like Nekki Basara, were known as Anima Spiritia to the Protodeviln and greatly feared. When Sound Force was established, the spiritia of Basara and his band Fire Bomber were transmitted to the enemy via the Sound Energy Converter and Sound Booster technologies. These systems proved very effective in combating not only the Protodeviln themselves, but also in hampering function of the Varauata Army`s technology.

In December of 2045, the Einstein became very active after the discovery of Protoculture Ruins on the planet Rax. The extensive facilities aided the UN Forces as they examined all information gathered from the Protoculture temple. Advisor Exedol was a key figure in researching data gathered about the Protoculture and the Protoculture connection to the Protodeviln. All this research was conducted on the research ship and Exedol remained aboard the Einstein up until the end of the Protodeviln War in 2046.

Piloting this variable fighter http://anidb.net/ch14046 [Mylene] participated in numerous sorties against Varauta forces along with http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Nekki Basara] in the http://anidb.net/ch49268 [VF-19 Custom] and http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Ray Lovelock] and http://anidb.net/ch14970 [Veffidas Feaze] in the http://anidb.net/ch49490 [VF-17T Custom].
The VF-11MAXL Custom is lightly armed, like most of the variable fighters modified for use in the Sound Force unit. The head cannon and gun pod were removed, leaving only four missile launchers in the dorsal/shoulder sections, two internal engine/leg launchers and two laser cannons. The primary weapon is a speaker-pod-firing launcher pod mounted on the ventral fuselage in fighter mode or in the manipulator in GERWALK and Battroid modes. http://anidb.net/ch14046 [Mylene] uses this weapon to fire speaker pods into enemy mecha and transmit sound energy directly to the enemy pilots. The variable fighter is also equipped with a high performance audio system and speaker system (speaker units mounted nose in Fighter and GERWALK modes or front torsoin Battroid mode) and a lightup projector system. The VF-11MAXL has also been modified with enhanced engines and more powerful vernier thrusters for faster performance and greater maneuverability.

<description>http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Ray Lovelock] was approached by the UN Forces to once again serve in the military after his retirement under distressing circumstances. http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Ray] accepted the unique proposal and became involved in Operation M, commanded by Macross 7 Captain http://anidb.net/ch41156 [Maximillian Jenius]. Originally involving only two members (http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Lovelock] himself and http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Nekki Basara]) the initial mandate of Operation M involved the deployment of only one customized VF-19 variable fighter, piloted by http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Basara]. Later in 2045, the paramilitary unit Sound Force was established and http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Ray Lovelock] was assigned to his own variable fighter, a custom VF-17T valkyrie. The Special Technologies Group onboard the Macross 7 extensively modified a two-seater VF-17T with an internal sound system and more powerful engines. http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Ray Lovelock] would pilot this VF-17T Custom into combat along side Sound Force, with http://anidb.net/ch14970 [Veffidas Feaze] as copilot.
The VF-17T Custom is primarily deployed as a Sound Energy variable fighter. The VF-17T Custom is not a direct combat unit (similar to the http://anidb.net/ch49268 [VF-19 Custom]) and as such carries only two laser cannons and four micro-missile launchers for emergency use only. The primary offensive weapon is a speaker-pod-shooting launcher pod (mounted with exit port in ventral fuselage/lower legs, ejecting from lower leg section into manipulator for Heavy Battroid mode). These armor-penetrating speaker pods can pierce through the hull of enemy mecha and transmit audio from the Sound Energy Converting system oboard the VF-17T Custom directly to the enemy pilots. http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Ray Lovelock] and http://anidb.net/ch14970 [Veffidas Feaze], as part of the rock music band http://anidb.net/ch49391 [Fire Bomber], participated in numerous sorties with the Sound Force unit.

He increases in size when he absorbs spiritia—which he can drain from lower life forms such as humans and Zentradi and even cause massive dehydration, but the energy of Anima Spiritia causes him to shrink, and after several encounters he flees instinctively from it. Lacking any discernible intelligence of his own, he is frequently given instructions by http://anidb.net/ch43863 [Gavil], the other half of an even more powerful being.

<description>The largest and newest carrier in the Varauta fleet. Equipped with numerous anti-ship and anti-fighter weapons, the New Giant Carrier has the same firepower as a heavy cruiser. However, the New Giant Carrier`s greatest asset is the capability to hold some 200 variable fighters. These fighters are released from 8 scramble catapults that can accommodate the launching of 3 fighters per catapult for a maximum of 24 simultaneous fighter launches. All 200 variable fighters can be prepared and launched within 20 minutes.

<description>As the primary transport carrier for the Varauta forces the Large Battroid Transport Carrier is somewhat deceptively named in contrast to it`s ubiquitous deployment. Though it transports Battroids, the Transport Carrier can also operate as a support carrier for launching fighters (with many linear catapults) and features fighter command and control equipment. The Transport Carrier also possesses powerful weaponry and heavy armor that allows the ship to engage other warships in combat. In a transport role, the Large Battroid Transport Carrier can hold up to 100 vehicles stowed in the cargo bays.

<description>A mechanical replacement for http://anidb.net/ch43881 [Valgo] after he was destroyed, the Natter-Valgo unit appears in http://anidb.net/a443 [Macross 7: The Galaxy`s Calling Me] as backup to http://anidb.net/ch43863 [Gavil] and http://anidb.net/ch49520 [Glavil]. It combines with them (in what http://anidb.net/ch43863 [Gavil] calls the "forbidden technique") to form a creature even bigger and more invulnerable than http://anidb.net/ch49594 [Gavigla], though the time for which they can remain merged is limited.

<description>Owned and operated by http://anidb.net/ch41428 [Emilia Jenius], daughter of Space War I heroes http://anidb.net/ch41156 [Max] and http://anidb.net/ch41157 [Milia Jenius], the Queadluun-Quilqua is a highly modified http://anidb.net/ch49048 [Queadluun-Rau] battle suit. Emilia herself underwent the micloning process to become giant sized and operates the Queadluun-Quilqua design for a giant-sized pilot. The battle suit features an armament nearly identical to the http://anidb.net/ch49048 [Queadluun-Rau] of the Zentradi Army and includes numerous micro-missile launchers on the back torso and lower legs. http://anidb.net/ch41428 [Emilia] has also installed several multi-colored smoke projectors in the battle suit to enhance her singing and stage prescence, long ago inspired by both her mother http://anidb.net/ch41157 [Milia] and singing idol http://anidb.net/ch7418 [Lynn Minmay]. At some time later in the Protodevlin War, http://anidb.net/ch41428 [Emilia]`s song energy attracted the attention of the Macross 7 fleet and http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Nekki Basara] left to investigate the origin of the energy. He arrived upon the UNG colony world Veil and encountered http://anidb.net/ch41428 [Emilia] in her Queadluun-Quiqua battle suit. Luckily the two came to an understanding just as the other members of Sound Force arrived, including http://anidb.net/ch41428 [Emilia]`s younger sister http://anidb.net/ch14046 [Mylene Jenius]. The Varauta forces detected the Spiritia disturbance and sent units to investigate. The two forces clashed in a battle in which http://anidb.net/ch41428 [Emilia] herself fought. http://anidb.net/ch41428 [Emilia] and Sound Force defeated the enemy Protodeviln forces, but her Queadluun-Quilqua was destroyed trying to prevent a mountain flood that resulted from the battle. Fortunately, http://anidb.net/ch41428 [Emilia] survived and remained on Veil.
