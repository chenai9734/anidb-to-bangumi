<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="264216">This is a really good anime though regretfully, it ended with only 12 episodes.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="402833">The concept/background regarding the censorship is not THAT far-fetched, just the counter-censorship method taken seems very unlikely to happen. The animation is very good, and you really enjoy the show as it has romance and a lil` bit of action and comedy. I loved the special episode as well.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="157883">Overall dramatic arc feels contrived, but I love the characters, and the chemistry between the two leads is very moe-kyun :)  I totally have a crush on Dojo.  Touches of comedy sometimes feel cliche, but never awkward or inappropriate.  Overall, a cute show, but the weak storytelling never really makes you feel immersed in the world.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="421413">Far-fetched because of going to battle for books?
Sadly, we can fully understand their resolution to fight against censorship now, with arrival of ACTA (ironically signed in Japan) ...I have to say it creeps me out how close to it we are in just 2012.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="2975">Original idea, unrealistic setting, nice romance and heroism.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="278370">Interesting if a little far-fetched concept, helped by genuinely interesting characters and setting.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on a light novel series by http://anidb.net/cr17923 [Arikawa Hiro], illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr11130 [Adabana Sukumo].
Toshokan Sensou tells the story of http://anidb.net/ch2601 [Kasahara Iku], the first woman to join the Library Task Force. In the near future in Japan, the Media Enhancement Law has been forced upon the population censoring all books and media. To counter this, the Library Defense Force was created. To protect themselves against the Media Enhancement Law Commission, all major libraries are fully equipped with a military Task Force, who take it upon themselves to protect the books and freedom of media of the people. This anime follows Iku and her fellow soldiers as they protect various special books and artifacts from the oppression of the Media Enhancement Law Commission. A love story, war story, and comedy all rolled into one.

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>noitaminA (ノイタミナ) – Animation written backwards – is a Fuji Television programming block, devoted to anime, broadcast each Thursday night from 00:45 to 1:15. It was launched with the intention of expanding the target audience beyond the typical young male demographic.
The timeslot was expanded from half an hour to a full hour in 2010, and now airs Thursday nights from 00:45 to 1:45.
noitaminA aired its first non-anime series in 2010, with the premiere of the live-action adaptation of Moyashimon. On April 15, 2010, Fuji TV and FUNimation announced an agreement that allows FUNimation to simulcast series from the noitaminA block in North America within an hour of their airing in Japan.</description>

A JDrama (Japanese drama), also called "terebi dorama" ("television drama") or "dorama" for short, is a Japanese live action television series.
Japan produces many drama series every year, from a huge variety of genres. Like anime, they generally air in three-month seasons or multiples thereof, with new shows airing every season. Some kinds of drama, especially the morning or afternoon ones, tend to be broadcast daily, while evening ones tend to be broadcast weekly, also like anime.
In exceedingly rare instances, a specific episode of a new original work anime can also be adapted.</description>

<name>Kasahara Iku</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Initially ranked Librarian First Class, but is later promoted to Chief Librarian. She joined the Library Defence Force`s Kantou Library Base in 2019 after being inspired by a high ranking Kantou Library Defence Force member who saved a book she wanted to buy that was targeted for censorship. She holds this unknown person in high regard, thinking of him as her "prince", and she wants to be an "ally of justice" as he was for her. As such, she has a strong sense of justice when it comes to freedom of expression and is willing to put her life on the line for the books she has sworn to protect. When she enters into recruit training, however, she finds it to be very challenging, made especially so by her drill instructor Atsushi Dojo who pushes her harder than most other recruits.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Dojo Atsushi is a twenty-seven-year-old member of the Library Task Force and is ranked Library Officer Second Class. He is 165 cm, though is thought to be too short for Kasahara, despite her only being 5 cm taller. He is very rough on Kasahara due to her not inspiring enough trust in him, and the fact that he believes he did not give her adequate recruit training. Part of the reason why he pushes Kasahara so much is that he sees his old self in her, and he is angry that she is bringing that back to him with such emotional force, despite him trying to forget about it.</description>

<description>A member of the Library Task Force, and is ranked Library Officer Second Class.

He is partly responsible to Kasahara being drafted into the task force.</description>

<description>A member of the Library Task Force and is initially ranked Librarian First Class, but is later promoted to Chief Librarian. He is drafted into the Library Task Force at the same time as Kasahara, though shows himself to be much more capable in terms of knowledge gained in lectures, clerical work in the base`s library, and in typical combat. He finds it hard to give credit to Kasahara in the beginning since she is not up to what he considers to be the standards of a Library Task Force member, though he later recognizes her improvement.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Captain of the Library Task Force and is ranked Library Supervisor Third Class. It is partly due to him that Kasahara is drafted into the task force, though since he is the captain, he had the final say. He is very strong, and Kasahara even thinks he has enough brawn to take on a bear full force. He is skilled in military command operations and in politics, such as giving Media Betterment Act agents books and magazines the Library Defence Force had copies of during an operation so that they do not leave empty handed either.</description>

<description>The commander of the Library Defence Forces, in direct charge of the Kantou Library Base and has been involved with the conflict between the Media Betterment Committee and the Library Defence Force since early on.

Inamine was caught in the middle of the conflict and lost his wife and his right leg because of it.</description>

<summary>Iku Kasahara joined the Kanto Library Defense Force because she wanted to protect books. How`s she supposed to do that when her instructor, Atsushi Dojo, has it out for her? Though she wants to be like her "prince," who gallantly protected her favorite children`s book from censorship, Iku`s got a long way to go before she catches up to him!
