<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="132945">Finally an anime tv series of this epic long running manga, to those who enjoy reading the manga, it is finally here. Finally.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="205511">if any of you have watched the ova, then this is a must watch on your list.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="560327">This series is a perfect introduction to the awesome Jo Jo Storyline, I`ve seen many things copied from this series but nothing ever better than the original. It may seem fast paced but everything goes literally by the manga, they also made it look more intense keeping that manga style look and effects that made this story so great in its time. If your a fan of anime and looking for a amazing adventure that might even make you say "WTF DID I JUST SEE" more than once this is for you.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="740913">While "Phantom Blood" isn`t the best part of the series, it is where it got its start. It`s a nice watch but even if you dislike it, I`d recommend you to sit through all nine episodes before starting "Battle Tendency" where it would fel much more rewarding with a better protagonist in Joseph Joestar.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="539006">WRRRYYYYYY</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="275472">The thing about JoJo is that it`s seperated into many parts, which all focus on a different member of the Joestar family. For example, the first part of the story involves Jonathan, a true gentleman, and the second part involves his grandson, Joseph. So, some people might like a certain member a little more. Personally, I like Joseph more because he`s a cunning badass, and I thought the first part was a little boring, but now I`m hooked! Just be patient and enjoy this bizarre adventure!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="48697">It`s definitely unique :D
12 episodes in, and i`m not sure if it is awful or actually good. Worth a watch just for that.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="165460">I`ve always heard about jojo, but never actualy read it. And now i must say i`m shocked, Never before a fighter anime has left me so satisfied. 

And while i usualy abhor sequels, i really hope to see more of this in the future. Literaly a must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="289333">one of the best adaptations out there, and simply one of the best shows in last couple of years, must see for any shounen fan.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="281995">A true classic! The animation might seem weird at first, but it`s clearly done with the intention of resembling the original as much as possible, and when you get used to it, it`s quite cool. The story is simple, but exciting and captivating. You can`t help but love the main characters in each saga.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="391389">Amazing Anime.. Feels a bit like hokuto no ken but that is not a bad thing.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="232559">Your Hamon is not strong enough! To compensate, you must watch this, now!</recommendation>

<description>* Based on a manga by http://anidb.net/cr981 [Araki Hirohiko], originally serialised in Weekly Shounen Jump from 1987 to 2002, before being transferred to the monthly Ultra Jump in 2004.
An epic horror-action-adventure! Spanning the generations of the Joestar family, each arc focuses on a certain member of the family and his/her battles with vampires, super vampires, and other Stand users.
Phantom Blood stars http://anidb.net/ch2068 [Jonathan Joestar] and the ambitious http://anidb.net/ch895 [Dio Brando]. It shows how the stone mask was found and how Dio first obtained and utilized his powers. Once Jonathan and http://anidb.net/ch47869 [Robert E. O. Speedwagon] realize Dio`s intentions, they must team up with http://anidb.net/ch47870 [Will A. Zeppeli] and learn Ripple (Hamon) to stop Dio.

<name>immortality</name>
<description>Immortality is the ability to live in a physical or spiritual form for an infinite or inconceivably vast length of time. Humans, whose life span is limited and who die of age, disease and external trauma, have long sought ways to extend their lives; the Epic of Gilgamesh, considered one of the first great literary works created by mankind, is primarily the quest of a hero seeking to become immortal. The advances of science, in particular medicine and engineering, and especially in the last few centuries, have helped people extend their life span and may yet continue finding ways to do so.
In fiction, immortals are not quite as uncommon as in real life, and the possible implications of endless or very long lives are often explored. Such implications include, but are not limited to: repeatedly accompanying the deaths of those dear to them; having to hide their condition from the mortals surrounding them; becoming disillusioned with their lives and being unable to kill themselves; and even staying forever trapped in the body of a specific physical age, that body most often being that of a child. As such, while many may wish for immortality, it may be little more than a curse for the few who have it.</description>

<name>vampire</name>
<description>A vampire is a mythological or folkloric nocturnal undead. Vampires use long fangs to penetrate the necks of people, usually young females, to drink their blood, both as a form of nourishment and to turn the targets into slaves.
In the classic vampire stories, they are thought to have no reflection in mirrors, are able to shapeshift into bats (sometimes also wolves or some form of fog), have unlimited lifespan and superhuman strength, reflexes and senses, and may only be killed by silver bullets, silver blades, a stake through the heart, fire, or exposure to sunlight; on the other hand, they cannot tolerate garlic, holy water, or Christian crosses (sometimes expanded to religious symbols in general).
In modern anime, these limitations are usually dropped, and they become far more powerful and fearsome opponents than usual. A human bitten, or sometimes even scratched, by a vampire typically becomes a slave, eventually dying as if poisoned, and becoming a vampire, ghoul, zombie, or other form of undead after death, often staying under the command of the vampire who originally bit them.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>The Victorian era of British history was the period of Queen Victoria`s reign from 20 June 1837 until her death on 22 January 1901. The Victorian Era style of clothing, however, ended in 1912. It was a long period of peace, prosperity, refined sensibilities and national self-confidence for Britain. Some scholars date the beginning of the period in terms of sensibilities and political concerns to the passage of the Reform Act 1832.

<name>World War II</name>
<description>World War II, or the Second World War (often abbreviated WWII or WW2), was a global military conflict which involved most of the world`s nations, including all great powers, organised into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. The war involved the mobilisation of over 100 million military personnel, making it the most widespread war in history. In a state of "total war," the major participants placed their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities at the service of the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Over seventy million people, the majority civilians, were killed, making it the deadliest conflict in human history.
The start of the war is generally held to be September 1, 1939, with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by most of the countries in the British Empire and Commonwealth, and by France. Many countries were already at war before this date, such as Ethiopia and Italy in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War and China and Japan in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Many who were not initially involved joined the war later, as a result of events such as the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the attacks on Pearl Harbor and British colonies, and subsequent declarations of war on Japan by the United States, the Netherlands, and British Commonwealth.
In 1945, the war ended in a victory for the Allies. The Soviet Union and the United States subsequently emerged as the world`s superpowers, setting the stage for the Cold War which continued for the next 46 years. The United Nations was formed in the hope of preventing another world conflict. The acceptance of the principle of self-determination accelerated decolonization movements in Asia and Africa, while Western Europe itself began moving toward integration.

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Racism is prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of an ethnically different background based on the pseudo-scientific belief that biological differences between peoples form so-called "races" and that one`s own "race" is superior to another, possibly also holding that members of different "races" should be treated differently. Some definitions include only consciously malignant forms of discrimination, and some views include discriminatory behaviors and beliefs based on cultural, national, ethnic, caste, or religious stereotypes. In works of fiction, this may also include similar actions against other sentient species.

<description>Time in comics is flexible. Each panel shows a single event, which is usually accompanied by a length of dialog, which must take some time to say. This disparity is usually accepted if it isn`t taken to extremes.
But often, characters will exposit when it`s most needed: at the story`s climax, when both the intricacies of the plot and the intensity of action hit their highest.
While the Heroes Outrun the Fireball, Mr. Exposition might explain why the Evil Overlord`s death caused the explosion. The Action Girl can deliver impressive lectures on why the monster`s Achilles` Heel will work, while still engaging in Waif-Fu. The Superhero can quip to his heart`s content and explain his abilities while dueling one insignificant mobster, or deliver a Kirk Summation during the course of a single Finishing Move. Sometimes even apparent mere mortals can give a lecture on what is happening when it would be a much better idea to simply run like hell.
Without stopping to breathe, apparently.

<name>gore</name>
<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<description>Somewhere down the line, it became the "norm" that boys don`t cry. The scenario does not matter; shedding tears is the ultimate no-no in terms of what you can and cannot do as a man (at least in the West, anyway). But there comes a time when a man`s emotions do get the better of him, and they pour forth - as prerequisite an impassioned speech may or may not be present - by cascading down his cheeks. These are what we like to call "manly tears". Extremely powerful. Not limited but often used in hot-blooded / super robot shows. Examples include Yuusha Ou GaoGaiGar, Getter Robo and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.
The opposite of manly tears are "girly tears".</description>

<description>Kuujou Joutarou has a very tough exterior, and is even rather rough and delinquent, but he also is very dedicated, intense, and loyal. He is intelligent, but usually lets his (or Star Platinum`s) fists do the talking with the enemy, even though he often has to rely on his wits to deal with stand users` attacks. Joutarou has a perpetual cooler-than-thou, slightly disinterested attitude, although he loves his mother and respects his grandfather. It is not that he is unaware of his own love and/or respect; rather, he thinks anyone can tell his emotions just by looking at him, and probably thinks further effort in portraying how he feels to be a waste of time. In the manga, he`s constantly chased by adoring girls, whom he ignores or tries to drive away. He is the main target of http://anidb.net/ch895 [Dio], who realises that Joutarou is his greatest threat.</description>

He is also ambitious, narcissistic, arrogant and megalomaniacal. He will do anything to get what he wants, even if it means trampling people, like he did to Jonathan Joestar when they were young, and relinquishing his humanity in favor of becoming a vampire. However, Dio shows a good side to those who are good to him. In particular, he has shown favourable attitudes towards Enrico Pucci, who also showed loyalty in return. Dio also has a passion for reading, as he is found in the library of his Egypt mansion many times.</description>

<summary>Three days after the incident, JoJo awakens to find Erina nursing him back to health in the hospital. As they rekindle their friendship, they encounter a strange man named Will A. Zeppeli, who performs a technique on JoJo which allows him to soothe the pain of his broken arm. Zeppeli tells JoJo about the technique, known as the Ripple, which uses the energy of ones own body to perform impressive feats of strength. He also reveals that Dio still lives, and it is JoJo`s fate to go against the stone mask. As JoJo ponders about not getting Erina involved, Zeppeli notices the ripple energy residing within him. Meanwhile, Dio continues to prowl London, recruiting the vilest men he knows into his undead army, including Jack the Ripper. As Zeppeli trains JoJo to master the Ripple, he explains how he was one of the first to discover the stone mask and witness its dark powers, dedicating himself to mastering the Ripple in order to destroy it. Just then, Speedwagon informs them of people going missing in Windknights Lot, so the three of them travel there. Whilst passing through a tunnel into the town, they are attacked by Jack, and Zeppeli enters into a fight with him to give JoJo his one and only lesson into how to use the Ripple. As Jack tries to lure them into a trap, JoJo is tasked by Zeppeli to finish him off without spilling any of the wine he has poured into a glass. Using the wine, JoJo comes to understand the Ripple, allowing him to kill Jack from the other side of a wall using his own Ripple technique: Overdrive.</summary>

<summary>Having found an antidote and given it to George, JoJo prepares to turn Dio in to the police. Dio tries to get JoJo`s guard down by saying he will turn himself in, but Speedwagon, who has followed JoJo from London, sees through Dio`s lies, presenting the druggist who sold Dio the poison, whilst George reveals that he has heard everything. As JoJo attempts to handcuff Dio, Dio attempts to stab him, only to stab George who got in the way to protect JoJo. With George`s blood, he activates the stone mask on himself before the police shoot him. Before passing away, George gives JoJo his late mother`s ring, admitting that he knew of Dario`s true nature before taking Dio in. Just then, Dio comes back to life as a vampire, proving invincible to firearms and draining the blood of one of the cops. As JoJo prepares to fight Dio, believing he can defeat him by destroying his brain, the cop comes back as a zombie, though JoJo manages to kill it. As several attempts to kill Dio fail, JoJo sets the mansion ablaze and leads Dio to the roof so Speedwagon can escape. JoJo attempts to kill Dio, dragging him into the flames of the mansion with him and with a powerful scream, manages to use the mansions layout to both land safely and impale Dio on a statue, assuming that he has been killed. However, as the druggist attempts to grab the mask from the burnt ruins, a charred hand kills him and drains his blood.</summary>

<summary>Seven years later in 1888, JoJo and Dio are supposedly getting along, though JoJo is still fearful of Dio after what happened all those years ago while Dio plots to take over the Joestar family. Meanwhile, George is sick with an ailment, which JoJo believes is more than a simple cold. While doing research on the strange mask, JoJo discovers a letter from Dario Brando, which describes his own symptoms that lead to his death which JoJo realizes are the same as George`s. Confronting Dio and successfully using his own pride against him, JoJo deduces that Dio is attempting to kill George the same way he killed his own father by poisoning him. After managing to overpower Dio, JoJo sets off to London to discover the origins of the poison, leading him to the dodgy Ogre Street. JoJo is attacked by a man named Robert E. O. Speedwagon, but after JoJo manages to defeat him without going as far as killing anyone, Speedwagon recognizes his determination to help his father and he decides to help him search for the Oriental druggist behind the poison. Meanwhile, Dio, believing his plans will be ruined if he cannot stop JoJo before he returns, steals the Stone Mask, believing he can use it to kill JoJo. After having a run in with two drunks, Dio decides to test the mask out, forcing it onto one of them and spilling the other`s blood onto it. However, instead of killing the man, the mask transforms him into a super powerful vampire who overpowers Dio and starts draining his blood. Dio only just manages to survive thanks to the sunlight killing the vampire, turning it into dust. Returning back to the mansion, Dio is confronted by JoJo.</summary>

<summary>England 1868. A thief tries to raid an overturned carriage, but discovers that two of the occupants, a man and his young son are still alive. The man, George Joestar, claims he will forever be indebted to his savior, who reveals himself to be Dario Brando. Twelve years later, George`s son Jonathan, nicknamed JoJo, is a young man with the intent to become a gentleman, such as fighting for a woman`s honor even if he will not win. Meanwhile, Dario is on his deathbed and he tells his son Dio to move in with the Joestar family to fulfill George`s life debt. Dio does so, but on his own volition that he will become the Joestar heir, particularly if it means turning JoJo into a pariah in his own home. Dio is welcomed into the family and begins to outshine JoJo in various gentlemanly tasks, and even bests JoJo in the boxing ring, all the while spreading lies about JoJo to his would be friends. Even JoJo`s childhood love with Erina Pendleton is not safe from Dio, who takes her first kiss and makes her unable to even look JoJo in the eye. Upon this discovery, JoJo flies into a rage and fights Dio who believes he has the upperhand until JoJo surprises him. Caught off guard, some of Dio`s blood is spilled on an ancient stone mask that seems to react until the fight is broken up by George. Later, the Joestar butler discovers that JoJo`s beloved dog Danny was somehow trapped in the incinerator, while JoJo knows that Dio is the one to blame.</summary>

<summary>As Bruford manages to barely avoid JoJo`s attack, JoJo is once again ensnared by his hair. However, JoJo manages to block Bruford`s attack and channel an Overdrive attack through his sword, disintegrating one of his arms, before unleashing a barrage against him. As Bruford`s body starts to disintegrate, he regains his human soul, feeling at peace and leaving JoJo his sword before completely disintegrating. Tarkus then attacks, but JoJo and Zeppeli manage to get Speedwagon and Poco to safety using a bunch of leaves as a hangglider. As they make their escape, Zeppeli recalls how he learned to control the Ripple from a man named Tonpetty. As Tarkus leaps after them, they touch down at a knight`s training ground in order to stand against him. JoJo is pulled inside the grounds by Tarkus, thrusting him into a Chain Neck Deathmatch, in which one must decapitate the other in order to free himself. Realizing JoJo will be killed if no one does anything, Poco overcomes his nerves and enters the grounds via a window, managing to unlock the door so Zeppeli can get inside.</summary>

<summary>Upon arriving in Windknights Lot, JoJo`s group is pickpocketed by a talented young boy named Poco who JoJo and Zeppeli manage to catch using their ripple powers. However, as the sun falls, they find themselves confronted by Dio, who had hypnotised Poco to lure JoJo`s group to the graveyard where they are attacked by his legion of zombies. Zeppeli attempts to use his ripple attacks on Dio, but he counters by freezing his veins. After also managing to freeze JoJo`s hand, Dio summons two powerful zombie knights, Tarkus and Bruford, to finish the job for him. As JoJo struggles against them, Speedwagon uses his body heat to thaw Zeppeli`s arm. As JoJo is forced by Bruford, he manages to use an air pocket from under a rock to utilise his ripple energy and launches an Overdrive attack at him.</summary>

<summary>In 1938, 49 years after Jonathan Joestar`s death, Speedwagon and Straizo travel to Mexico, where they discover an underground room filled with similar looking masks and a petrified body believed to be the being who created them. Meanwhile, in New York, Jonathan`s grandson, Joseph Joestar (also nicknamed "JoJo"), saves a young pickpocket named Smokey Brown from some corrupt policemen using the Ripple. Smokey is then taken in by Erina. Back in Mexico, Speedwagon is betrayed by Straizo, who uses one of the masks to become a vampire. After dealing with a mafia henchman at a restaurant, Joseph, Erina, and Smokey meet a mafia acquaintance of Speedwagon`s who informs them that Speedwagon has been murdered by Straizo, with Erina deducing to have something to do with the mask. Later, Joseph is confronted by Straizo, making the first move with an over-the-top Tommy Gun attack.</summary>

<summary>As Dio falls following his battle with JoJo, he decapitates himself before the ripple reaches his head, which is recovered by his zombie servant Wang Chung. Meanwhile, with the Stone Mask destroyed, JoJo marries Erina and they head off on a honeymoon to America on a cruise across the Atlantic Ocean. As JoJo and Erina enjoy their cruise, JoJo discovers that Wang Chung has snuck aboard, meaning Dio is still alive. As JoJo comes face to face with Dio, who wants his body to replace his own, Erina arrives on the scene just as JoJo receives a near-fatal attack to his neck. Meanwhile, the ship starts to run amock with zombies after Wang Chung spreads the infection. Using the last Ripple energy he has, JoJo manages to decapitate Wang Chung, making his body obstruct a piece of the cruise ship`s mechanism, setting the ship on a path to explosion. As Erina resolves to die by JoJo`s side, JoJo tells her to live on so she can protect a baby whose mother was killed. As the ship starts to explode, Dio makes a last ditch attempt to take JoJo`s body, but JoJo stops him, passing away with Dio`s head in his arms whilst Erina and the baby hide in Dio`s bomb-proof coffin to protect them from the explosion. Erina is eventually rescued near the Canary Islands a day later, and vows to pass on the truth of what happened on that night, 8 February 1888, through the generations, starting with the child she conceived with JoJo before his untimely death.</summary>

<summary>After Poco hears that Peggy has gone out to search for him, Dio sends a zombie named Doobie to attack Peggy after she refuses to join his legion. Luckily, JoJo and the others arrive in time to save her. Doobie soon reveals that his head is filled with poisonous snakes, managing to deliver a few bites to JoJo`s face, but neither the venom nor Doobie stands up to JoJo`s power. With Poco and Peggy reunited, JoJo goes on to face Dio. Dire decides to face him first and launches an attack, but he is caught by Dio`s freezing ability and is shattered into pieces, though with his last breath, he manages to shoot a ripple-powered rose into Dio`s eye. As Dio learns from that sacrifice how he can damage Dio using the sword he received from Bruford, he goes on to confront Dio whilst Tonpetty and Straizo take on his undead army. JoJo manages to slice his sword straight through Dio`s body, but Dio uses this opportunity to freeze his sword and attack JoJo`s neck. However, JoJo manages to thaw himself by heating the sword with a torch, though Dio manages to protect himself from JoJo`s attack. Just then, JoJo sets his fists on fire to counter Dio`s freezing and manages to break through his defenses with an Overdrive attack. As his body melts and he falls into the abyss, Dio launches a final attack which pierces JoJo`s hand, but appears not to do much more. With Dio presumed dead, JoJo takes a long earned rest from his battles.</summary>

<summary>Zeppeli recalls how Tonpetty foretold where his death would take place; in the very place he is in right now. Knowing this, Zeppeli fights against Tarkus with the intention of finding a way to free JoJo. However, Tarkus ensnares him with a chain and rips his body into two. Using the last of his strength, Zeppeli transfers the last of his Ripple energy to JoJo, allowing him to heal his injuries, break free from his chains, and obliterate Tarkus. Following the battle, Zeppeli tells JoJo that he has accepted his fate and has passed his will onto him before passing away. As JoJo, Speedwagon, and Poco make their way back to Windknights Lot, they meet Tonpetty, along with his other students, Dire and Straizo. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Poco`s sister, Peggy, has been kidnapped by Dio.</summary>

Meanwhile, Stroheim manages to awaken the pillar man, naming him Santana. To test him, Stroheim sends a vampire after Santana, which he absorbs into his body to feed itself. To Shorheim`s shock, Santana manages to escape his cell by twisting his body through the air vents and confronts him, quickly learning and killing Stroheim`s men.

<summary>As expected, Straizo recovers from Joseph`s attack and uses the laser eye attack Dio used to seemingly pierce through JoJo`s head and neck. However, this turns out to be a clever trick by Joseph, who manages to attack Straizo with the Ripple. Straizo manages to block it using a scarf woven from beetle muscles, but Joseph manages to sneak some grenades onto his person. Despite being blown apart, Straizo manages to pull himself back together, forcing Joseph and Smokey to retreat to a bridge. As Straizo catches up with them, he takes a woman hostage in order to goad Joseph into facing him. Straizo once again attacks Joseph with his laser, but Joseph manages to reflect it back at him before striking him with the Ripple. As Joseph tries to get information out of him, Straizo warns Joseph about a `Pillar Man` who will soon awaken before killing himself with his own Ripple. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Speedwagon is alive but he is being held captive in Mexico, where a German military general named Rudol von Stroheim interrogates him about the Pillar Man, which they have excavated from the cave and intend to revive. Meanwhile, Joseph also makes his way to Mexico, unaware that he is being followed by a strange assassin.</summary>
