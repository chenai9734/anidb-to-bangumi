<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>henshin</name>
<description>Japanese for "transformation" (metamorphosis or disguise).
A "henshin anime" is any anime, where the characters or their costumes transform, such as Sailor Moon. The henshin switches on the character`s special powers, and is frequently accompanied by a costume change. Often the change of clothing is the only outward indicator that the character has changed and yet nobody seems to notice the hero`s true self.
Most henshin heroes have a special item which they use to change into their heroic form. These items are usually activated by a command phrase (which is often in Engrish, for some reason), triggering a transformation sequence.</description>

<name>Mr. Satan</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Mr. Satan (known as Hercule in the English adaptations) is a flamboyant martial artist. After http://anidb.net/ch2103 [Gokuu] and his companions stop attending the Tenkaichi Budoukai, Mr. Satan starts winning them and becomes the reigning champion for many years.
On a Q&amp;A with mangaka http://anidb.net/cr1902 [Toriyama Akira] published in Super Exciting Guide - Character Volume on April 3, 2009, it is revealed that Mr. Satan is just a stage/ring name and that his actual first name is "Mark". While it seems like a common name, it is actually written out in katakana as マーク (maaku). If you rearrange the syllables, as you would with many names in the series to derive their puns, you end up with akuma (meaning "devil" or "demon"), which is in concordance with his daughter`s name being a pun on the English word "devil".
During the Cell Games, he attempts to fight http://anidb.net/ch24822 [Cell], but even after being swatted away, he is given credit for Cell`s death by the media. He is soon called a world hero, gaining great wealth and a city named after him. Though Gokuu and his companions find his inflated ego and arrogance very annoying, he becomes close to them after befriending the good http://anidb.net/ch41758 [Majin Buu] and by helping defeat Kid Buu by using his appeal to the people of Earth to get energy for the Genki Dama. His daughter, http://anidb.net/ch12209 [Videl], marries http://anidb.net/ch9915 [Gohan].</description>

<name>Jinzouningen 18 Gou</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Jinzouningen 18 Gou (Android #18 in the English adaptations) is a fictional character who first appears in the Dragon Ball manga created by http://anidb.net/cr1902 [Toriyama Akira], followed by the shows http://anidb.net/a1530 [Dragon Ball Z] and http://anidb.net/a233 [Dragon Ball GT]. She is a mass murderer in http://anidb.net/ch13302 [Future Trunks]` timeline.
Originally a human, she and her brother were modified into cyborgs by http://anidb.net/ch18381 [Dr. Gero].
On a Q&amp;A with mangaka http://anidb.net/cr1902 [Toriyama Akira] published May 2nd, 2014 it was revealed that her human name was Lazuli.
After http://anidb.net/ch20915 [Cell] is defeated, http://anidb.net/ch11414 [Kuririn] uses the Dragon Balls to wish for her and her brother to be turned into humans; http://anidb.net/ch7015 [Shenron] is unable to perform this task because of the unfathomable differences in power between him and the duo, so he wishes instead for their self destruct devices to be removed. Kuririn pursues her and, at some point, they marry and have a daughter named http://anidb.net/ch30874 [Marron].
To clear up the heavily espoused misconception that she is a pure android and therefore could not have a child, Kuririn went on to explain to http://anidb.net/ch2103 [Son Gokuu] during the Tenkaichi Budoukai Saga that she was originally human but that Dr. Gero just "remodeled her a little bit."</description>
