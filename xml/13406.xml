<description>The great Buddha gave the eminent Jade Emperor the task of ruling the celestial and mortal worlds. However, mortal human beings did not have an awareness of time, which spelt calamity. To avert this, the Jade Emperor gave a celestial order: "Let it be known in the mortal world, that I, the Imperial Jade Emperor, shall appoint 12 animals to ascend to the celestial world. These 12 species of animals shall represent a cycle of 12 years with each animal representing a year. Any humans born in a particular animal`s year shall bear that animal`s mark and his strength. This representation shall be known as the Zodiac."
But deep in the dark swamps, the thousand-year-old tree spirit, determined to thwart the plans of her long-time enemy, the Jade Emperor, sets forth to prevent the success of the Race by impeding the 12 chosen ones.
