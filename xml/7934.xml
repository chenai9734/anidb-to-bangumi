<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="391848">One of the rare shows that features high school delinquents in an exaggerated and cliched manner. Fans of delinquents would probably find it worth sitting through just to watch it for that reason alone.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="572320">If you`re looking for an anime that`s really funny with no flipping skirts or falling to girls huge breast. Ect, the typical stuff then this anime for ya.
Yes, this anime is super funny and full of action!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="716480">A good one for those who like comedy. Have some good fights but pretty short ones and the story doesn`t really get going. But pretty good laughs all over the series. 
A season for idle times, nothing serious they just kind of abandon it in the end.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="310513">A terrible adaptation to one of the best manga around. Poor voice acting, poor animation quality, lame fillers; it will hardly garner many fans aside from the a proportion of the fans from the manga, unless of course, they decide to improve the sectors mentioned above.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="311537">didn`t like the anime, but the manga was very good.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on a manga by http://anidb.net/cr20954 [Tamura Ryuuhei], serialised in http://anidb.net/cr5372 [Shounen Jump].
http://anidb.net/ch21279 [Oga Tatsumi], the strongest juvenile delinquent, is a first year at Ishiyama High, the school for delinquents. He tells the story of how he found baby http://anidb.net/ch21273 [Beelbou] to his best (and only) friend http://anidb.net/ch21274 [Furuichi Takayuki]: One day while fishing by the river (actually, taking revenge on people trying to kill him in his sleep), he sees http://anidb.net/ch21271 [Alaindelon] floating down it, he pulls him to shore and the man splits in half revealing a baby boy. This boy is the son of none other than the demon king http://anidb.net/ch21276 [Daimaou] and Oga has been chosen as the one to raise it with the help of the baby`s maid http://anidb.net/ch21272 [Hilda].
Since Oga can no longer part with Baby Beel — without almost dying — they visit the delinquent school together from then on. An inconvenience, that Oga attempts to `pass on` to other students at Ishiyama — the theory is that if Oga can find someone more evil and stronger than himself, Baby Beel will `attach` to that person instead. After subsequently fighting and defeating all members of the Touhoushinki and in the process, destroying Ishiyama High itself, Oga and company are transferred to Saint Ishiyama Academy, a carefully monitored school that does not have any delinquents, yet...</description>

<name>horny nosebleed</name>
<description>In Japanese media, healthy young men who have no other sexual outlet will often suffer nosebleeds upon seeing the naked female body, or even just a pair of well-filled panties.
The nosebleed is, of course, a visual shorthand/euphemism for sexual arousal. It is commonly interpreted that way for males and females, with little trickles of blood indicating mild arousal, and gushing fountains of blood indicating erection/extreme arousal in both sexes. It can also be interpreted as shorthand strictly for erections in males. In that case, when blood shoots from the nose explosively, and in ridiculous quantity, the implication would be an ejaculation.

<name>delinquent</name>
<description>Delinquents - Every school has them, but not all anime with school setting make delinquents a central topic. There are several versions of these delinquents, though some are grounded on a misunderstanding:
* The student with a really bad image and attitude, based on his real criminal actions outside of the school and is even feared by teachers.
* The primitive "class bully" that pushes around ("clobbers") his classmates for no apparent reason, possibly extorting lunch money.
* The student with an sinister complexion or "evil eye", but is actually a "good" student (unfoundedly feared character).
* The rebellious student, who does not care for studying, but is otherwise docile. Called a "delinquent" as a joke.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<name>absurdist humour</name>
<description>Surreal humour, also known as absurdist humour, is a form of humour predicated on deliberate violations of causal reasoning, producing events and behaviours that are obviously illogical. Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, non-sequiturs, irrational or absurd situations, and expressions of nonsense.
The humour arises from a subversion of audience`s expectations, so that amusement is founded on unpredictability, separate from a logical analysis of the situation. Its appeal stems from the fact that the situation described is exceedingly ridiculous or unlikely.
On an analytical level, all jokes contain a certain amount of incongruity, but while regular jokes carry an incongruity that the audience accepts as compatible with expectations, absurd jokes are characterized by a disproportionate amount of it, with the punch line delivering a situation incompatible with the world as we know it and failing to resolve the matter in the audience`s eyes.

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>An onsen is a term for hot springs in the Japanese language, though the term is often used to describe the bathing facilities and inns around the hot springs. Often the cast of a show somehow ends up going to an onsen because of various reasons, such as winning a lottery ticket. 
Usually used for fanservice purpose as it gives the staff the opportunity to draw the characters nude and raise the DVD sales.
Another cheap variant is the http://anidb.net/t4290 [sentou episode].

<name>be careful what you wish for</name>
<description>Be careful what you wish for... your wish may actually come true. This is an age-old philosophical problem of what human beings think they want and what is actually good for them. The power to wish for anything can be very dangerous and usually — as a moral lesson — yields unexpected / unwanted results.
A contract with the devil is a specific case of this; receiving great power, especially from a devil, is usually a double edged sword.</description>

Another use of narration comes in the form of a dominant voice belonging to one of the protagonists, intended only for the viewer and revealing the intimate thoughts to whom it belongs. This type of narration occurs frequently throughout the duration of the episode or movie.</description>

<name>gangs</name>
<description>A gang is a group of people, through the organization, formation, and establishment of an assemblage, share a common identity. In current usage it typically denotes a criminal organization or else a criminal affiliation. In early usage, the word gang referred to a group of workmen. In the United Kingdom the word is still often used in this sense, but it later underwent pejoration. The word gang often carries a negative connotation; however, within a gang which defines itself in opposition to mainstream norms, members may adopt the phrase as a statement of identity or defiance.
The word "gang" derives from the past participle of Old English gan "to go". It is cognate with Old Norse gangr, meaning "journey."</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Hilda is an attractive blonde woman with green eyes and a well endowed bust. Her clothes are mostly black with white quillings and thus resemble Lolita Fashion. She is seen outside this outfit on usual occasions. One occasion being right after she wakes up, wearing a modest pink, night gown with her hair down.
In one chapter, she was shown wearing a yukata while playing with fireworks along with Lamia. When Hilda was shown to wear a Yukata.
Another being when she infiltrates Oga`s current school, dressing in the Saint Ishiyama High`s uniform, though she complains that the shirt is "a little tight".
Hilda commonly displays a cold and impassive demeanor, a character trait that she breaks only on rare occasions. (excluding her interactions with Be`el). Toward Be`el she is very affectionate and protective, acting as the role of the mother and preforming the task a mother would such as cooking for and washing Be`el. She often knows more about the current situation than any of the other protagonists and is easily able to manipulate the others into doing what she sees best.
She is shown to be just as bloodthirsty and violent as Oga, a trait that earned her the nickname "Oga`s Bride" at Ishiyama. In a fight she displays a complete confidence in her own skill and power, regarding her opponents calmly and often taunting them in mid battle.
She enjoys teasing and tormenting Oga, frequently making marks about his intelligence and (in her own mind) poor parenting skills. In the beginning of the series she is openly dissaproving of Oga as Be`els` parent but after the delinquent defeats Toujou she becomes much more accepting and warmer towards him, even thanking him after. But she still bickers with him.
In Chapter 104, it is hinted that her time with Oga and Baby Beel has changed her, as Isabella noted that her personality has changed since coming to human world and wonders what kind of human is responsible for this change.

<name>Kunieda Aoi</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kunieda Aoi is 17 years old, a second-year student and the third leader of the "strongest ladies of Kantou", the Red Tails. She is first introduced in disguise at the park taking care of her baby brother, Kouta, who is constantly mistaken as being Aoi`s own child by the mothers at the park. She is the daughter of a local temple keeper. Her nickname is Queen because she is the protector of all the girls at Ishiyama High from the men`s "grubby hands". Because of Oga`s dense personality, he has yet to realize that the girl he befriended at the park and Kunieda are one and the same. Despite her tough personality, she has a rather girlish crush on Oga but refuses to admit this fact to others. She can feel Saotome using his demon power, which shows she has notable strength for a human.
Kunieda differs from the other thugs at Ishiyama in that she has formal martial arts training from her grandfather, the master of the shingetsu style. She is also not a bully, and steers the leadership of the Red Tails towards preventing unnecessary fights in the school. This is what puts her first in collision course with Oga, as the latter is deemed by her to be responsible for most of recent violent events in the school. They have two exchanges: in neither does Oga return her attacks, limiting himself to evade them, first to let baby Beel assess her strength and thus find out whether she is a potential replacement for him; later, because a failure in communication leads Oga to believe that Kunieda`s condition to take Beel is that he should resist her charges. She is greatly impressed by Oga`s speed and power, and misunderstands his advances on her (to get rid of Beel) as romantic interest. After he saves her from a plot by the MK5, she decides to leave the Red Tails and become a more disciplined person, and at the same time her crush on Oga increases. Later, she and the Red Tails intervene to stop the whole male student body of Ishiyama from attacking Oga, allowing him to proceed to a confrontation with Toujou unhindered.
She at first harboured some jealousy against Hilda, seeing her as a potential rival for Oga, but on discovering the truth about her and Baby Beel`s true nature, their animosity disappears.
She is a skilled swordsman and martial artist, and possesses an immense amount of vitality and stamina, as well as impressive speed that is above Sakaki Mitsuteru`s, who is known to be able to wield his sword at 250 km/h (however, she is not fast enough to hit Oga, who manages to evade even her best attacks with minor injuries). She can use any weapon she chooses in battle, and has even been shown to fight with nothing more than a ruler. She has shown the ability to assess opponents`s strengths and weaknesses very quickly.</description>

<description>A leading member of the Red Tails. Chiaki rarely speaks and dispatches her enemies swiftly with a pair of modified air-guns hidden under her skirt.

She is the first to recognise that Kunieda is in love with Oga and thinks it very cute, as opposed to Nene.</description>

<description>A first year student who looks up to thugs and gangs and wants to become a delinquent himself. He deeply admires Oga as the best hoodlum around and their first contact is when Oga and Kunieda save him and his friend Azusa from harassment by Teimou students. He then kowtows to Oga and begs to become his underling. After some insistence and flattery, Oga ends up accepting his company. He also admires Furuichi, to the latter`s delight, calling him "general Furuichi", for being the only man able to follow Oga. His plot role so far has been mostly comic relief and as an information source on the Six Knights.</description>

<name>Lamia</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A demon doctor who is very small. Lamia comes to the human world in her capacity as Dr. Rachmaninoff`s assistant to help in treating baby Beel and later takes care of Oga`s wounds after a confrontation with a demon. Like her boss, she can read minds, even baby Beel`s, although she does not do it very often. She disapproves of Oga as Beel`s parent, but reluctantly accepts it after his battle with Toujou. Although she seemed cold and hostile upon their first encounter, she thanks Oga for saving her after the incident in the demon world. She is very protective of Baby Beel and greatly respects Hilda, whom she refers to as "Hilda-nee-san." Her name is possibly an allusion to the mythological demon. Later in the series, she seeks Furuichi`s help to find Lord En on Hilda`s request. Furuichi suspects her of being a tsundere character. Lamia carries a pistol loaded with bullets containing demonic concoctions that can erase memories, force a person to do one`s bidding or, in the case of Oga, trap him in a psychic loop. She is always accompanied by two small muumuu pets, one of which sits atop her head and often mimics her mood. Her age is unspecified, but her appearance is that of a pre-teen girl. Her mother is general Laymia of the 34th Pillar Squad.</description>

<description>A former imperial doctor to the royal family. He has the appearance of a tall, dark-haired man, but in the human world he takes up a provisional body due to his contempt of humans. This body is similar to one of Lamia`s "muumuu" pets, a random mass with a pair of eyes that can float above the ground at times. He is able to read minds. A highly skilled physician, he is first brought by Hilda in order to diagnose baby Beel, and is able to devise a cure for the kid by restablishing his bond to Oga. He comes back later to treat Hilda`s wound. Furcas and Saotome know each other, but the nature of the acquaintance, as Saotome`s connection to the demon world, is currently unknown. His name is probably a reference to a demon of the same name. It is later revealed that Furcas current position is as doctor to the 34th Pillar Squad.</description>

<description>A spellmaster, a human who made a contract with a demon and becomes capable of using their powers, who is assigned to Oga`s class. The difference between simple contractors and spellmasters is not clear and may be just a matter of experience. It is not known which demon made the contract, but it is implied to be a member of the royal family, as Hilda recognises the seal on his hand. He seems to have made the contract a number of years before, as a very young Toujou remembers seeing the spell on his shoulder. He wears a bandana, long, black dishevelled hair and is always seen smoking. He is also quite perverted, shamelessly flirting with Kunieda and her subordinates, peeking up Hilda`s skirt and also groping her breasts during their fight.</description>

However, he is outmaneuvered by Himekawa and ends up agreeing to the condition of removing the Horsemen`s authority in case Ishiyama win the volleyball match, which they do.

<description>Baby Beel`s elder brother, sent by their father to help in destroying mankind. He is a very spoiled, pompous child and a video game addict. However, he seems to be extremely powerful, on par with his brother: if he cries, he will destroy everything in a radius of 15 km in a sea of flames. He is also lazy and a crybaby, and is not as interested in destroying mankind as he is in clearing video games. Lord En seems to have a crush on Lamia and even calls her his wife, but she does not reciprocate. His juvenile canine teeth are actually fangs and the left one is slightly longer. He has green hair like his brother and is attended by three wet nurses.</description>

In contrast to Hilda, she has a femme fatale attitude. It is later revealed that she is a dimensional transfer demon like Alaindelon; her powers are said to be even greater than his, and she is able to distort dimensions and create sections of space detached from the physical world.</description>

<description>Hecadoth is the 8th Pillar. He begins his attack on Oga and the others by imprisoning Kunieda with the intention to use her blood to forge a demon contract; it is understood that the already powerful demons increase their power in the human world considerably if they find a contractor. It seems that the contract itself is not necessarily consensual.</description>

<description>Naga is first introduced alongside Graffel (see below) when the latter attacks Izuma and Toujou, but maintains a detached attitude that contrasts with Graffel`s violence. He rushes with Graffel to Hecadoth`s aid against Saotome, only to be dispatched to the demon world by the teacher. It is later revealed that he is known as the Water Dragon King and his power is way above Hecatos` and Graffel`s. His black aura often takes the shape of a dragon. He is probably named after the Hindu deity. Naga is eventually defeated by Oga and Beel`s Super Milk Time.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Graffel, the 7th Pillar, also works under Naga and is first presented when he interrupts Toujou and Izuma`s fight, having been attracted to it by Izuma`s demonic energy. He is very proud of his power and considers humans and lower demons inferior, and nearly kills Toujou and Izuma before sensing Saotome`s attack on Hecatos and rushing to his aid. He is sent back to the demon world by Saotome. He is later the first victim of Oga and Beel`s Super Milk Time.
Graffel is general Yata`s younger brother, although Yata considers him a good-for-nothing. Despite this assessment, his loyalty to Lord En is such that, alongside Hecadoth and Naga, he takes the initiative to kill Oga without authorisation from the Squad`s leadership, and is ready to give his life to attain that goal. After their second defeat, he and Hecadoth are seen imprisoned in Akumano High`s dungeon.

<description>The shy young daughter of the keeper of the Mapputatsu shrine, she is first introduced when Grandpa Kunieda takes Oga and the others to spend the night there. She immediately recognises Baby Beel`s true nature and is greatly scared of him. She is described by Kunieda as very spiritually aware and, besides demons, can detect the presence of ghosts and perform exorcisms. Kunieda requests her help to learn how to defeat a demon, with a view to fighting the 34th Pillar Squad, as Oga and Toujou. Isafuyu then introduces Kunieda to the minor god Koma.</description>
