<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="442930">Pretty average for overall enjoyment.  Great animation, but everything else is average or below.  Definitely watch it if you enjoyed the series, it`s a nice top-off.  Not worth the time as a stand-alone movie.</recommendation>

<name>military</name>
<description>The military, also known as the armed forces, are forces authorized and legally entitled to use deadly force so as to support the interests of the state and its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its citizens and the prosecution of war against foreign powers. The military may also have additional functions within a society, including construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding critical areas.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Super Robot Wars</name>
<description>Super Robot Wars is a series of tactical role-playing video games produced by Banpresto. The main feature of the franchise is having a story that crosses over several popular mecha anime, manga and video games, allowing characters and mecha from different titles to team up or battle one another. Due to the nature of crossover games and licensing involved, only a few games have been released outside Japan, and in English; early English-language games only feature Banpresto`s original characters and mecha, and a flagship installment were to never be released until 2016, with the English release of Super Robot Wars V in Southeast Asian countries. The franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2016.

<description>Celestial Being is a private paramilitary force founded by the scientist Aeolia Schenberg. It pursues the complete eradication of armed conflict mainly through the deployment of the revolutionary Gundam units, as well as other mobile units in aggressive, sometimes indiscriminate armed intervention. It acts upon the advisory of the artificial intelligence Veda, and its preferred mode of operation resembles guerilla or maneuver warfare. As of the initiation of its publicly visible activities in 2307, Schenberg appeared in a taped worldwide broadcast announcing the organization`s existence and intentions. Many people of Earth began a love/hate-like relationship with Celestial Being, though everyone does not desire war. Some people, like Marina Ismail of Azadistan, believe that they create only more conflict by intervening.</description>

<description>Louise Halevy is the daughter of Barry Halevy, the leader of a fossil fuel export regulation watchdog group. Because of her family`s wealthy lifestyle, she possess somewhat of a selfish behaviour and often demands people to get what she wants. A year before the event of the anime series, both she and her father were protected by Celestial Being when a terrorist organisation are planning to target Louise`s father for assassination. This was Setsuna F Seiei`s first task since joining the organization to prevent the assassination of Barry Halevy and protecting his daughter. Although Louise and her father were protected by Setsuna, they have never met each other face-to-face, until a year later she was introduced to him by Saji Crossroad.</description>

<description>As the daughter of Ian, she was part of Celestial Being by default and learned much about engineering, GN Technology, and programming while growing up, and now joins the crew of the Ptolemaios. Normally at the operator`s chair but also a mechanic with the inherited knowledge and skill of her father. She brightens up her surroundings with her cheery expressions and behaviour; she particularly appears to enjoy asking others if they are lovers based on her "maiden`s intuition." Her carefree behaviour even when the situation is bad constantly makes Ian angry and scolds her about it.</description>

<name>GN-0000+GNR-010 00 Raiser</name>
<gender>none/does not apply</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>Because 00 is a experimental MS, the unit also suffers from power stability issues and requires constant maintenance. 00`s Twin Drive System was imperfect and requires 0 Raiser (00 Raiser) to safely execute Trans-Am and provide protection upon the GN Drives. 00 Raiser became the mainstay form of 00 Gundam to effectively combat A-Laws and Innovators enemy mobile units. As 00 Raiser, the unit has greater GN particle generation and the use of the Raiser System.
The Raiser System allows 00 Raiser to execute powerful attacks such as a mega beam saber called Raiser Sword, hyper vector close range combat, and utilize Trans-Am with greater power and duration. 00 Raiser originally needed both its GN Swords to produce Raiser Sword, but was later upgraded with GN Sword III. The new sword was able to utilize the power of the Raiser System to generate a refined Raiser Sword. The power of 00 Raiser is further enhanced with the neural interface of an Innovator pilot. The Innovator pilot can execute Trans-Am Burst, which results in a massive burst of GN particles within a large area of space. Overall, 00 Raiser is a Gundam that exceeds in performance to all mobile suits.
00 Gundam can combine with GNR-010 0 Raiser to become 00 Raiser, the binders detach and combine onto 00`s GN Drive shoulder mounts and it`s main body combines with back of 00 Gundam, giving it an mechanical/angelical-like form. Its primary function is to stabilize the operation of the Twin Drive System and Trans-Am System, allowing the 00 to effectively harness its massive particle production (which is too much for the 00`s frame alone) and utilize its full potential. With the constant need for 00 Gundam`s full capabilities, 00 Raiser became the mainstay form in combat. In its 00 Raiser form, 00 can generate 300%+ GN particle efficiency.
00 XN Raiser is the combination of a variant version of 0 Raiser and 00 Gundam. The docking system and appearance is similar, however there are notable differences. In flight mode, XN Raiser has the appearance of a X-Wing-like configuration. XN Raiser carries a pair of GN Buster Sword IIIs and have a series of extended wing-fins for aerodynamic flight. The GN Buster Sword IIIs act as a second pair of wings while in flight. XN Raiser`s binders doesn`t dock into 00`s twin GN Drives, they instead fold up during docking mode. The entire system docks onto 00 Gundam`s back as a weapons backpack.</description>

<name>Haro</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Haro is the mechanical mascot of the Gundam science fiction anime metaseries, and is the only character that appears in more than one timeline.
The original Haro is a little robot companion built by the main character Amuro Ray. It is a cute testament to Amuro`s exceptional talent for machines. Haro`s features include a limited range of speech, and the ability to hover (in environments with atmosphere and low gravity) by flapping its ear-like appendage coverings. Haro can usually be found rolling behind Amuro`s next door neighbor Frau Bow. The ability to detect brain waves is also one of Haro`s functions; in one of the episodes, Haro actually claimed that the brain wave of Amuro was lowered/different.
In Zeta Gundam, a mass-produced Mk-II version of Haro ends up in the hands of that series` main protagonist Kamille Bidan, who initially suspects it to be the original. He repairs the robot, only to have it constantly address him as Amuro.
During the events of Char`s Counterattack, Amuro gives a "third-generation" Haro to Hathaway, the son of his captain Bright Noa.
Haro continues to permeate the Gundam franchise, having appeared in Gundam SEED as Lacus Clyne`s multi-colored horde of simple-speech robot pets, built for her by Athrun Zala. These Haros are roughly 1/4 the size of their Universal Century counterparts and are similar in function, however a few possess certain abilities such as unlocking doors. Lacus`s favorite Haro is a pink machine that she refers to as "Pink-Chan" (often translated as "Mr. Pink" or "Pinky"). Another notable Haro in Lacus`s collection is "Navy-Chan", a navy blue robot on which she paints a mustache bearing a distinct resemblance the facial ornament of the ∀ Gundam of the CC (正歴 Seireki) calendar system. The rest of Lacus` Haros have been seen in yellow, orange, blue, green, and black. The parody comic Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Club Yonkoma states that Athrun has built a total of 35 Haros for Lacus.
In Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Celestial Being had produced unknown numbers of Haros as an assistant of daily maintenance works. Currently at least 6 unique Haros have appeared in the animation production. The Haros in the series took much more maintenance and combat role than any other series` counterpart, usually seeing them operating with various machines, including mobile weapons.</description>

<description>The estranged son of Sergei Smirnov and member of the A-Laws. Andrei holds a grudge against his father for not protecting his mother 14 years before the beginning of the second season and joins the HRL military and later the A-Laws to forge his own path. Andrei meets Louise Halevy and develops a relationship as he sees her more suited as a lady then a soldier, often protecting her in battle.
After the AEU`s orbital elevator collapse as a result of a coup d`état by the Federation`s military, Andrei kills his father in a fit of rage when Andrei assumes that Sergei sided with the coup d`état forces. He eventually comes to terms with his father`s actions and in the epilogue, continues to serve in the Federation army in relief efforts in order to live up to his mother and father`s hopes for the world.</description>

<name>Amia Lee</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Amia Lee is one of the infected victims of the ELS in Mobile Suit Gundam 00 The Movie: A Wakening of the Trailblazer.
In 2314 AD, the ELS had come to Earth to assimilate humans with quantum brainwaves. During the ELS`s attack, Amia was in her teens and was also a latent Innovator.
One day, returning home from school, Amia was attacked by the ELS. She encountered an ELS in the form of a Ribbons-type Innovade, who had assimilated her house. She tried to open her own home door after her door security lock didn`t recognize her fingerprint, the Ribbons-type attempted to assimilate her through the other side of the door. As soon as she made contact with the door knob, her right palm was partially infected with ELS cells. To free herself, she ripped a layer of her flesh and fell to the ground. Unfortunately, she was unable to escape in a state of high anxiety. The ELS-Sky came out of her home, of which the inside had been turned to metal, and assimilated the left side of her body as she screamed in fear. She was left unconscious and was saved by Celestial Being Gundam Meister Leonard Fiennes and Innovade Lars Grise, who happened to be a friend of Sky`s. The ELS Sky transformed into a airplane as Leonard gave chase in GN-007/AL Arios Gundam Ascalon. Amia was later picked up by ESF authorities. She was later taken into a ESF Research facility to be treated and observed by Billy Katagiri and his colleagues. During the appearance of a huge number of ELS on Jupiter, she was shown reacting to it, eventually revealing her awakening as an Innovator. It is unknown if her Innovation was caused by Setsuna`s Trans-Am Burst two years prior or her half-assimilation by the ELS.
Nothing is shown from her ever since, until 50 years after the ELS Conflict. In AD 2364, 50 years later, Amia became a part of a deep exploration expedition team and prepping to depart on the Sumeragi. Though technically a woman in her 60s, her Innovator physiology ages much slower than a regular human, granting her the physical appearance of a woman in her early 20`s. Additionally, she also has a small patch of silver hair and skin, indicating that her body is partially infused with ELS.
