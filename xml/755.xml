<recommendation type="Must See" uid="555927">This Gundam is quite underrated - it has solid plot (at the level of the rest gundams), it`s full of action and even has a bit of romance.
If you`re a gundam fan - you definitely must watch it.
If you`re just looking for a nice postapocalyptic sci-fi  - give it a try, probably you won`t be disappointed.

Too bad that it has too little episodes compared with another gundam series.</recommendation>

<name>military</name>
<description>The military, also known as the armed forces, are forces authorized and legally entitled to use deadly force so as to support the interests of the state and its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its citizens and the prosecution of war against foreign powers. The military may also have additional functions within a society, including construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding critical areas.

<description>A robot is an automatically guided machine, able to do tasks on its own. Another common characteristic is that by its appearance or movements, a robot often conveys a sense that it has intent or agency of its own.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>post-apocalyptic</name>
<description>An anime that takes place on future Earth (or it could be an alternative universe) after a major cataclysm has occurred. World War III, an alien invasion, plague, global warming or some other general disaster are common themes to build a post-apocalyptic world upon, where the effects were severe enough that mankind barely survived.
The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologised). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in an agrarian, non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of technology remain. There is a considerable degree of blurring between post-apocalyptic fiction and that which deals with false utopias or dystopian societies.</description>

<name>impact event</name>
<description>An impact event is a collision between celestial objects causing measurable effects. Impact events have physical consequences and have been found to regularly occur in planetary systems, though the most frequent involve asteroids, comets or meteoroids and have minimal impact. When large objects impact terrestrial planets like the Earth, there can be significant physical and biospheric consequences, though atmospheres mitigate many surface impacts through atmospheric entry. Impact structures are dominant landforms on many celestial solid objects and present the strongest empirical evidence for their frequency and scale. In fiction, an impact event is a common way to end the world as we know it, either through the impact itself or through its aftermath, and it may happen either naturally or through human hands; this may include man-made objects, such as space debris and fictional space colonies.

<description>Super Robot Wars is a series of tactical role-playing video games produced by Banpresto. The main feature of the franchise is having a story that crosses over several popular mecha anime, manga and video games, allowing characters and mecha from different titles to team up or battle one another. Due to the nature of crossover games and licensing involved, only a few games have been released outside Japan, and in English; early English-language games only feature Banpresto`s original characters and mecha, and a flagship installment were to never be released until 2016, with the English release of Super Robot Wars V in Southeast Asian countries. The franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2016.

Initially he defeated Garrod with the RMSN-008 Bertigo, severely damaging the Gundam X, but later falling to the upgraded Divider and a recovered Garrod. After the New United Nations Earth is established, he joins an anti-UNE militia in the North American continent, later intercepting a convoy carrying the Freeden Gundams and rescuing the Vulture crew. He later takes part in the final battle and becomes a peace ambassador for his country.</description>

For much of the series, he nurses a fairly obvious crush on Tiffa but does not act, fearing that the Tiffa would be unnerved by his advances, since she was denied most of her childhood. His love for her is what drives him to pilot the GX-9900 Gundam X, the GX-9900-DV Gundam X Divider, and later the GX-9901-DX Gundam Double X. At the end of the series, he and Tiffa go off together when the crew of the Freeden disband.</description>

<description>The Freeden chief mechanic, and a (self-styled) technical genius at the age of 12. He strives for high quality and professionalism in his work, and will push himself to work beyond exhaustion. He also has an impulsive side; specifically, he can hardly resist tinkering with Mobile Suits and other large mechs. His grand ideas, however, led to the powerful upgrades for the Freeden Gundam complement. At the series` close, he, along with Shingo, Paula, and his two subordinates Lokoko and Nine open a repair shop and salvage yard called "Freeden III".</description>

<description>The captain of the Freeden, a Vulture ship. He was once a Newtype pilot of the old United Nations Earth who piloted a Gundam X in the 7th Space War, and it was also him who fired the fatal shot which changed history. Now he searches the Earth for Newtypes to rescue and protect. It seems that he has had feelings for a fellow Newtype named Lucille Lilliant for many years, and at the end of the series he gets together with his advisor Sala Tyrrell and works as a liaison between the Earth Governments and the Space Colonies.
Jamil Neate and Lancerow Dowell`s rivalry mirrors that of the Newtype aces Amuro Ray and Char Aznable. Their final battle in 7th Space War is similar to the final clash of the original Gundam series between the Gundam and the Zeong. However, Gundam X goes to an alternate way at the last, where Lancerow saved Jamil`s life and worked as the representative of the SRA in the peace conference after the war.</description>

<description>The GX-9900 Gundam X (GX) is one of three advanced mobile suits created by the United Nations Earth Space Force to fight against the Space Revolutionary Army. The Gundam X was the most powerful of the three models mainly because of its powerful weapon, the Satellite Cannon, which was specifically designed to destroy space colonies. Three GX units are known to have survived the 7th Space War. One was found and piloted by 15-year-old Garrod Ran, who later joined the crew of the Frieden. The second was found by the New United Nations Earth, which studied it and develop the Double X. The third was found by Vultures Rick Arel and Rosa II, aboard a sunken UNE submarine.</description>

<description>In October A.W. 0015, the 8th Space War began between the New United Nations Earth and the Space Revolutionary Army. The crew of the former Vulture landship Freeden wanted to intervene and end the conflict, but they needed a way to get off the Earth first. That way presented itself at a New Orleans military base controlled by anti-New UNE opposition forces. The Freeden crew stole a battleship from the New Orleans base, which they named Freeden II. After reaching space, the Freeden II was caught in the middle of the fighting between the New UNE and the SRA, but it broke a path through the battlefield to reach the Moon where D.O.M.E., and the ultimate secret of Newtypes, lay.</description>

<description>In the chaos following the apocalyptic end of the 7th Space War, Vultures roamed the Earth gathering old technology left over from the United Nations Earth and the Space Revolutionary Army. Many Vultures used land battleships such as the Alps class on their scavenging journeys. The Alps class ship Freeden was captained by Jamil Neate, a former Newtype who fought as a UNE soldier during the 7th Space War and piloted the GX-9900 Gundam X that destroyed a space colony and set off the SRA`s massive colony drop. Although the Freeden`s crew collected old mobile suits like other Vultures, Jamil had another purpose in mind - find and protect Newtypes. One such Newtype was Tiffa Adill, whom Jamil rescued from the Alternative Company`s research lab in April A.W. 0015. After Garrod Ran joined the crew with his Gundam X, the Freeden set out on a worldwide journey to find Newtypes and contact them. During this journey, the Freeden encountered the New United Nations Earth military, which was conquering the world to unify it. After the New UNE is founded in July A.W. 0015, the Freeden makes landfall in South Asia and joins the People`s Republic of Estard in its fight against the New UNE. Following the fall of Estard, the Freeden traveled to the New UNE`s Newtype Research Facility, where Tiffa was kidnapped by an SRA spy and taken to space. While fighting to send Garrod and his GX-9901-DX Gundam Double X, the Freeden was destroyed when it rammed into the New UNE`s land fortress Bandaal.</description>

<description>During the military chaos wracking Earth in A.W. 0015, a band of Vultures based on the land battleship Freeden encountered a remnant of the Space Revolutionary Army in the form of the powerful RMSN-008 Bertigo mobile suit and its Newtype pilot, Caris Nautilus. Garrod Ran`s GX-9900 Gundam X was severely damaged by the Bertigo`s remote bit weapons, and it had to be overhauled and rebuilt to return to combat readiness. Its satellite cannon was damaged beyond repair and had to be scrapped, but Kid Salsamille, the Freeden`s resourceful young mobile suit mechanic, rebuilt the GX and gave it an extra beam sword, a salvaged, space battleship-grade 2-barrel beam machine gun, extra vernier thrusters, and a "divider" shield which not only mounted 13 linked beam guns (also called a "beam harmonica"), but also mounted thrusters and control surfaces to put it back into the air. Renamed the GX-9900-DV Gundam X Divider, this rebuilt mobile suit would prove to be even more effective than its namesake in terms of conventional maneuverability and firepower. Initially, the GX Divider still required the G-controller unit for activation and operation; however, with the absence of the satellite cannon (and the Freeden crew`s only handy G-controller being needed to operate their newly-captured GX-9901-DX Gundam Double X), Kid soon modified the GX Divider`s cockpit panel so that it could be activated without a G-controller. With Garrod piloting his newly stolen Double X, the GX Divider was passed down to Jamil and served as his personal mobile suit throughout the rest of the military conflict in A.W. 0015.</description>

<description>As the New United Nations Earth consolidated its power in its plot for world domination during the post-7th Space War in the After War Era, the military began development of advanced new mobile weapons. When the crew of the Vulture land battleship Freeden learned of the existence of a new mobile suit equipped with the devastating satellite system and went to investigate, they were forced to surrender at the New UNE`s Zonder Epta base under the threat of the new GX-9901-DX Gundam Double X. However, the Freeden crew soon managed to make their escape, and Vulture pilot Garrod Ran captured the Gundam Double X for their own use.
The Double X was a great improvement over its GX-9900 Gundam X predecessor. It mounted a much more powerful twin satellite cannon, as well as improved hyper beam swords and a wide variety of hand armaments. However, one critical difference between the Double X and the GX was its lack of a flash system; instead, the recorded brainwaves of Jamil Neate - stored in the computer of his wrecked original Gundam X which was recovered by the New UNE - were recorded in the Double X`s control computer, allowing a non-Newtype pilot to activate the satellite system and fire the Double X`s twin satellite cannon. Like the Gundam X, a G-controller unit was required to activate the Double X and fire the twin satellite cannon. Fortunately for Garrod, his G-controller that he used on his old GX was compatible with the Double X, allowing him to use its devastating weapon. In the last battle of the 8th Space War, the Double X was severely damaged in a final duel with the Frost brothers.</description>

<description>During the 7th Space War, the United Nations Earth developed and deployed three advanced new mobile suit designs to counter the Space Revolutionary Army. One of these new units was the GT-9600 Gundam Leopard, and like its brethren GW-9800 Gundam Airmaster and GX-9900 Gundam X, it was equipped with a "flash system", enabling a Newtype pilot to mentally remote-control a large number of bit mobile suits (or "mobile bits") - in the Leopard`s case, the FT-9600 GT-Bit. Although incapable of atmospheric flight, the Leopard was equipped with a set of gliding wheels in its feet, allowing it to "drive" on the ground at high speeds. The Leopard was also massive armored and armed, with its primary weapon being a large-caliber "inner arm Gatling" which was fitted over the left arm when in use. A multitude of additional armaments, including various missiles, grenade launchers, and shell-firing weapons, made the Gundam Leopard a literal walking fortress.
Although an unknown number of Leopards were manufactured, only one unit is known to have survived the war. This last remaining Leopard would find its way into the hands of Vulture mercenary pilot Roybea Loy, who operated this heavily-armed Gundam during the military chaos occuring in A.W. 0015. Later that same year, Kid Salsamille, the ingenious young mobile suit mechanic aboard the Vulture land battleship Freeden, developed an optional "S-1" booster, allowing the Leopard to operate underwater like an amphibious mobile suit. The unit would later be upgraded to the GT-9600-D Gundam Leopard Destroy after being heavily damaged in a battle with Milra Draido`s NRX-010 Gable.</description>

The Airmaster was also unique in that it was one of the first mobile suits to be equipped with the "TransSystem", a design concept which enabled the Airmaster to transform into a fighter-like craft capable of atmospheric flight. Although only lightly armed with vulcan guns and a pair of "buster" beam rifles, the Airmaster was quite nimble as an aerial combat unit.
Although an unknown number of Airmasters were manufactured, only one unit is known to have survived the war. This last remaining Airmaster would find its way into the hands of Vulture mercenary pilot Witz Sou, who operated this transforming Gundam during the military chaos occuring in A.W. 0015. While fighting the New UNE in the Asian nation of Estard, it became apparent that the Airmaster`s aging design was not performing well against new designs such as the NRMA-006 Gadeel mobile armor. After being damaged in battle, the Estard government offered its resources and upgraded the unit to the GW-9800-B Gundam Airmaster Burst.</description>

<description>During a battle against the New UNE`s massive (and beam weapon-proof) NRX-010 Gable mobile suit, Roybea Loy`s GT-9600 Gundam Leopard was heavily damaged, as his was the only unit among the Freeden`s mobile suit complement armed with a significant number of conventional, non-beam weapons. Following the battle, the Freeden`s ever-resourceful mobile suit mechanic, young Kid Salsamille, set to work to rebuild Roybea`s suit. The refurbished unit was renamed GT-9600-D Gundam Leopard Destroy, and its weaponry loadout was overhauled, replacing many of its old conventional arms with a greater number of beam weapons. As a result, the Leopard Destroy`s armament was now considered more "well-balanced", thus helping Roybea to better use his Gundam against the increasingly powerful New UNE military.</description>

<description>While the crew of the Vulture ship Freeden were aiding in the defense of the People`s Republic of Estard against an invasion by the New United Nations Earth, Witz Sou`s GW-9800 Gundam Airmaster was heavily damaged during an intense dogfight against the New UNE`s superior NRMA-006 Gadeel mobile armors. After the battle, the Estard government offered to assist the Freeden crew with their repairs and supplies, and Witz accepted the offer. Kidd Salsamille, the Freeden`s young mobile suit mechanic, worked side-by-side with engineers in the Estard military to rebuilt Witz`s trashed mobile suit. The result was the GW-9800-B Gundam Airmaster Burst, sporting not only a snazzy new blue-on-white paint job, but an increase in armor and firepower. The original Airmaster`s nose vulcan guns were replaced with beam guns, and a pair of additional beam cannons were mounted on each wing. Although the Airmaster Burst was heavier than its original form, speed and maneuverability were not sacrificed, as additional jets were also installed in the wings to compensate for the extra bulk as well as improve performance. With these improvements, Witz`s reborn Airmaster Burst was more than capable of holding its own against the New UNE`s Gadeels and other aerial combat units.</description>

<description>During the 7th Space War, the United Nations Earth created the GS-9900 G-Falcon as a support fighter for its line of Gundam mobile suits. The G-Falcon was capable of docking with a Gundam to provide added firepower and mobility. Despite being produced during the 7th Space War, the G-Falcon was still compatible with the New United Nations Earth`s latest mobile suit, the GX-9901-DX Gundam Double X. The G-Falcon itself was armed with a pair of scattering beam cannons, two vulcan guns and an array of infrared homing missiles. Long after the war, a G-Falcon unit was salvaged and rebuilt by Satelicon, a guerilla group fighting against the machinations of the Space Revolutionary Army. In September A.W. 0015, the SRA destroyed Satelicon`s asteroid base after the group attempted to assassinate colonial leader Seidel Rasso. Afterwards, G-Falcon pilot Pala Sys helped Garrod Ran foil the SRA`s Operation Dahlia by destroying a converted colony laser. Pala then joined Garrod`s Vulture group just as the 8th Space War began between the SRA and New UNE.</description>

<description>During the 7th Space War, the Space Revolutionary Army developed various mobile suits and armors for use by Newtype pilots. One such suit was the RMSN-008 Bertigo. This agile mobile suit carried the standard armament of beam rifles, machine cannons and beam sabers, but its most powerful weapon was the bit. These remotely operated beam guns could only be operated by a Newtype, but their power was devastating. The ability of the bits to create an all-range attack would prove too be nearly impossible for a non-Newtype to beat. Before the war`s end, the SRA planned to bring a swift end to the battle with its Operation Lilac. In this operation, five Bertigos were supposed to escort the massive Newtype mobile fortress MAN-003 Patulia down to Earth to attack the United Nations Earth headquarters. However, the five Bertigos were destroyed in atmospheric combat, and the Patulia changed course and crashed elsewhere. It is not known how many Bertigos survived the war, but at least one unit survived until A.W. 0015 and was piloted by artificial Newtype Carris Nautilus. The effectiveness of the Bertigo was displayed in battle when Carris severely damaged Garrod Ran`s GX-9900 Gundam X, which was later repaired and upgraded to the GX-9900-DV Gundam X Divider. After the fall of Fort Severn, Carris helped to rebuild the city and later joined resistance forces fighting against the New United Nations Earth in North America. After rescuing the former crew of the Freeden, Carris joined their fight in space during the brief 8th Space War.</description>
