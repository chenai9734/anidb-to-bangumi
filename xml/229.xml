<description>Centuries in the future, in the year After Colony 195, Earth is surrounded by orbiting space colonies. The colonists are cruelly oppressed by the Earth Alliance, which uses huge humanoid fighting machines called "mobile suits" to control the populace. Behind this tyranny is the secret society called "Oz," which has infiltrated the Alliance military and steered it towards its repressive course.
Now, the space colonies are ready to strike back. Five young pilots, equipped with advanced mobile suits called "Gundams," are sent to Earth to wage guerilla war against Oz and its Alliance puppets. The war to decide humanity`s destiny begins...</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Space Travel usually refers going to space or travelling there with or without a spacecraft.

<description>The anime will fit this category if some or all of the action takes place on another planet which is supposedly in the same universe as Earth, not a complete fantasy world; usually there has to be some concept of space travel. The Latin name for Earth - Terra, would also pass the condition of being in the same universe as Earth. Basically, even mentioning of Earth existing or having existed would be enough. Although Moon is a moon, it also qualifies as Other Planet.</description>

The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<name>footage reuse</name>
<description>Footage reuse is the employment of a sequence of frames many times, generally as a side effect of a constrained anime production budget. This can happen by using the same footage once at a time, but many times over the course of the show, or by directly looping it. Types of scenes that tend to get reused include: transformations, such as those typical of superheroes or magical girls, characters that change into powered-up versions of themselves, or robots changing shape; attacks, especially when involving a series of steps that must be followed before the attack can be launched; and any kind of action that involves repeating the same movement.
This tag does not apply if the footage changes significantly between iterations. An example of that is the infamous Endless Eight arc of http://anidb.net/a6367 [the 2009 iteration of Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu]; even as the plot repeated itself, each episode of the arc showed it in different ways.</description>

<description>A circus is a company of performers that may include clowns, acrobats, trained animals, trapeze acts, musicians, hoopers, tightrope walkers, jugglers, unicyclists and other object manipulation and stunt-oriented artists. The term circus also describes the performance which has followed various formats through its 250 year modern history. 
Philip Astley is credited with being the father of the modern circus when he opened the first circus in 1768 in England. Early circuses were almost exclusively demonstrations of equestrian skills with a few other types of acts to link the horsemanship performances. Performances developed significantly through the next fifty years, with large scale theatrical battle reenactments becoming a significant feature. [...]

<description>The most common example is that of a voice, either that of one of the characters or entirely unrelated, that appears at the beginning of an episode to offer a summary or introduction, and at the end of an episode for closure or for a preview to hint upon what to expect next.
Another use of narration comes in the form of a dominant voice belonging to one of the protagonists, intended only for the viewer and revealing the intimate thoughts to whom it belongs. This type of narration occurs frequently throughout the duration of the episode or movie.</description>

<name>melodrama</name>
<description>A melodrama is a dramatic work that exaggerates plot and characters in order to appeal to the emotions, often with strongly stereotyped characters. Language, behaviour, or events which resemble melodramas are also called melodramatic. In scholarly and historical musical contexts melodramas are dramas of the 18th and 19th centuries in which orchestral music or song was used to accompany the action.
Melodrama is a style of drama that has been applied on the stage, in movies and television, and radio formats, from the 18th century to the present. Because of the long timeframe in which the style has existed, it is difficult to derive a precise definition. The term melodrama is most often used pejoratively, to suggest that the work to which the term is applied lacks sophistication or subtlety.
The term originated from the early 19th-century French word mélodrame, which is derived from Greek melos, music, and French drame, drama (from Late Latin drāma, which in turn derives from Greek drān, to do, perform).

<description>Sometimes normal just doesn`t cut it. Eating: you put food in your mouth and chew. Playing sports: you throw a ball around. You need to make it awesome, no matter how mundane it is.
Let`s throw in some gripping orchestral music, lighting changes, different camera angles, something! Don`t write like a man, write like an evil overlord! Exaggerate your expressions and gestures, speak with excessive intonation, and if all else fails, throw in some close-ups, slow motion, and ominous Latin chanting! With practice, even you can turn something like eating chips into an epic battle of light and dark, blinding the viewer with sheer awesomeness.

<description>Super Robot Wars is a series of tactical role-playing video games produced by Banpresto. The main feature of the franchise is having a story that crosses over several popular mecha anime, manga and video games, allowing characters and mecha from different titles to team up or battle one another. Due to the nature of crossover games and licensing involved, only a few games have been released outside Japan, and in English; early English-language games only feature Banpresto`s original characters and mecha, and a flagship installment were to never be released until 2016, with the English release of Super Robot Wars V in Southeast Asian countries. The franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2016.

<description>e a forty-man private army of Arabian mobile suit pilots. The name means "family" or "relative" from the Tagalog word, mag-anak (inspired by the Filipino and Arab workers in the middle east, specially, Saudi Arabia, most of them are engineers). Led by Rashid Kurama, they are often seen at Quatre`s side, who they refer to as "Master Quatre". In Episode Zero, Quatre saved them and they`ve been at his service ever since. Almost all the Maganac have the same mobile suit, but each of the squad leaders have their own personalized touches, the most notable being Rashid`s wing-shaped antenna atop his suit`s head.</description>

<charactertype id="3">Organization</charactertype>
<description>The Specials were formed in AC 176 as an elite branch of the Alliance forces and were the first forces to use mobile suits. They are the ones with the most advanced equipment and the best training and tactics. What no one knows is that the Specials are really a secret organization known as the Organization of the Zodiac, or OZ for short. OZ is the youth movement of the Romefeller Foundation, and is the primary target of the Gundam Pilots and Operation Meteor. The manga prequel Gundam Wing: Episode Zero reveals the original leader of OZ was General Catalonia, but was succeeded by Treize Khushrenada following his death.
Treize Khushrenada later sets up the deaths of the Alliance leaders, then his forces launch Operation Daybreak, a coup against the Alliance. OZ takes over the Earth and finally takes center stage. Their clever plan of using General Septem to blame the Gundam Pilots for the deaths of the Alliance Leaders causes the pilots to lose all support from the colonies. OZ goes into space and is able to take over the colonies by telling them that they will liberate them from the Alliance`s tyranny.
OZ is known for their many mobile suits, almost all named after Zodiac signs and the creation of the Mobile Doll, a fully automated mobile suit that needs no pilot. The second meets with great disapproval from Treize, who believes that it takes all the honor and beauty out of battle. This becomes a nuisance to Romefeller, who eventually bullies Treize out of power. They still fear his influence and keep him under house arrest in his Luxembourg mansion.
After Treize`s resignation, OZ splits into two parts, Romefeller and the Treize Faction, who are loyal to and agree with Treize. The two fought and the majority of the latter`s forces are destroyed in a battle at Luxembourg. Many of the surviving members continue to operate underground (with some supporting Treize in his own bid for power in the wake of White Fang`s emergence). A few of them joined the Sanc Kingdom`s defense force. Of particular note, where a Treize Faction unit that were chased into the Sanc Kingdom by the Romefeller Foundation. After assisting Noin, Quatre and Heero in defending the nation, the unit joined the defense force. Others, in space join the White Fang, though many regret this once Treize comes to power on Earth.</description>

<description>European aristocrats came together many years ago to create the industrial combine known as the Romefeller Foundation. They backed the Alliance and funded its forces, as well as OZ`s, and it was they who began production of mobile suits for military use in AC 176. Their main goal, however, is to gain control of the entire earth.
Romefeller spearheads the movement to bring mobile dolls into the OZ forces. Treize Khushrenada disagrees with it, and Duke Dermail, head of Romefeller, pushes him to resign. When this happens, OZ splits between those loyal to Romefeller, which now come out of the background of the world scene, and those loyal to Treize. Romefeller is the dominant power, crushing its opposition. It then sets its sights on the countries that oppose its rule, calling this military action Operation Nova. One of these countries attacked is the Sanc Kingdom, which had influence over Romefeller`s supporters. Its ruler, Relena Peacecraft, dissolves the nation to avoid the bloodshed.
The general public greatly dislikes Romefeller, so Dermail decides to install Relena as a puppet ruler. She accepts, becoming Queen, and made a rousing speech about how they could now peacefully rule the earth as a World Nation. Surprisingly, with the exception of Dermail, all the Romefeller members take her side. Dermail goes off into space to gain support there, but his shuttle is destroyed by members of the newly formed White Fang and he is killed. Following the destruction of Libra, the Romefeller foundation is eventually dissolved.</description>

<description>In AC 133, after decades of war between the various nations on Earth, the United Earth Sphere Alliance was formed, uniting every country on Earth under one rule, securing peace. Every country on Earth had a representative in the Alliance. Separatist nations who seceded from the Alliance, deciding not to submit to their rule, were destroyed by the UESA forces. The orbiting space colonies resisted, and formed a pacifistic colonial alliance under the leadership of Heero Yuy. Heero Yuy`s ideology of total pacifism was embraced by a number of national leaders on Earth, notably the Sanc Kingdom`s governing Peacecraft Monarchy. After the assassination of Heero Yuy by OZ in AC 175, the Alliance used military force to seize control of the colonies, on the basis of securing "justice and peace". All contact between individual colonies was severed and the colonists were oppressed. In AC 182, a few years later, the peaceful Sanc Kingdom was also invaded, and the Peacecraft family executed, in order to prevent secessionist intentions. By now many, in the colonies and on Earth, saw the UESA as having turned into an iron-fisted dictatorship.
The Alliance was funded largely by the Romefeller Foundation, which covertly influenced its actions and had a special military force of mobile suit pilots known as the Specials, secretly the OZ organization, within the Alliance Mobile Suit Corps. On May 19, AC 195, top Alliance leaders met at the New Edwards Base in California, to discuss a peace treaty with the colonies at the behest of Field Marshal Noventa, the pragmatically pacifist Supreme Commander of the Alliance military. In the middle of the proceedings, the Gundam Pilots attacked, going on information that top OZ officials were meeting at New Edwards. The leaders tried to escape in shuttles, but Treize Khushrenada was able to trick Gundam pilot Heero Yuy, into destroying the shuttle holding all but one of the leaders. The remaining officer, General Septum of the Alliance space forces, was kept alive only long enough to publicly confirm that the Gundams were responsible for the assassination of the Alliance leaders.
During the resulting chaos, the Specials revealed their true identity as OZ began attacking UESA forces across the globe, and, in a bloody coup d`état known as Operation Daybreak, quickly annihilated surprised Alliance troops and took control of a large portion of the Earth in a single day. The war between OZ and the Alliance would last for several months, which the Alliance ultimately lost. Afterward, all that was left of the Alliance were small remnants in space, such as Gwinter Septum`s (son of the late General) space force stationed at colony D-120. Many of these remnants were destroyed one by one as OZ ventured into space, while some joined the White Fang.
Certain former Alliance units on Earth formed paramilitary groups after the UESA`s collapse in order to continue to fight against OZ and Romefeller. Of particular note were the members of the former Alliance Deep Sea Unit which assisted former Alliance Major Sally Po in locating the XXXG-01W Wing Gundam after its pilot, Heero, had departed for outer space, leaving the mobile suit behind. Other members joined the Sanc Kingdom`s defense force.</description>

<description>In late AC 195, a militia group forms, composed of Treize Faction members, remnants of the United Earth Sphere Alliance, and discontent colonists. Headed by Quinze, a mysterious man who worked behind the scenes for Operation Meteor, they want total independence for the colonies.
To this end, the rebel group starts what they called the Artemis Revolution. In this swift movement, they take control of the powerful colony-sized Battleship Libra, and kill Romefeller`s Duke Dermail as he tries to gain power in the colonies. Probably their most vital victory is the takeover of Romefeller`s Lunar Base, and the mobile doll factories within. They seize Chief Engineer Tsuberov, but he manages to escape, and is killed in an explosion as he tries to activate the dolls to attack the intruders.
Quinze finds Milliardo where he went off alone with Epyon after the fall of the Sanc Kingdom, knowing that he is a charismatic leader loved by many, as well as a powerful warrior and ruthless military mind. He offers Milliardo the chance to become leader of the White Fang, which he accepts.
In his new position, Milliardo declares war on Earth, calling it the force which conflicts with space. The World Nation, headed by Treize, goes to space, and the Eve Wars begin, a long and horrible battle between the two. Treize is killed in the battle, and the World Nation surrenders, but the colonies declare that they are not supporting the White Fang. Peacemillion rams into Libra, destroying the cannon it planned to use on the planet. The White Fang then plans to drop Libra on the surface, creating an eternal winter, but Heero Yuy and the Gundams destroy Libra before it enters the atmosphere. Milliardo disappears in an explosion while destroying Libra`s power core and is presumed dead, and the remnants of the White Fang are mostly destroyed by the Gundams.</description>

<description>The Sanc Kingdom (also spelled as Cinq, French for 5) is a fictional country in Northern Europe, somewhere in Scandinavia. They held the belief of total pacifism that the colony leader Heero Yuy held before his assassination in AC 175. Unfortunately, the Alliance did not like their advocation of total pacifist beliefs, and decided to silence them. In AC 182, the Alliance attacked, and the capital fell in one day. King Peacecraft, and much of the ruling Peacecraft Family were killed, with only the King`s two children surviving. Relena Peacecraft was adopted by the King`s aide, who would later become Vice Foreign Minister of the Alliance and an integral member in Operation Meteor. Milliardo, the King`s son, seems to disappear.
Thirteen years later, after the assassination of Vice Foreign Minister Darlian, Relena learns of her true heritage from him just before he dies. After the Alliance is overthrown by OZ, Milliardo, now known as Zechs Merquise, returns with men loyal to him from before the country`s fall and liberates the country from Alliance control. Relena, after a failed attempt to kill Lady Une to avenge her foster father`s death, is rescued by Lucrezia Noin and taken back to the Sanc Kingdom, where Relena resurrects the country under her leadership and her father`s ideals. Milliardo, after discarding his Zechs persona, heads for space as the kingdom`s ambassador to the colonies.
The country`s strong pacifist beliefs are quickly seen as a threat to the Romefeller Foundation as it begins to influence other nations. Duke Dermail, one of Romefeller`s leaders, comes to see the nation as an obstacle to his plans and incites the foundation to initiate Operation Nova to force the country to comply. The Sanc Kingdom falls under attack several times, defended only by Gundam pilots, members of the Treize Faction and former members of the Alliance. To save the lives of her citizens, Relena Peacecraft eventually dissolves the country and offers herself as a prisoner to OZ.</description>
