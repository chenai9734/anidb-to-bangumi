<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>Sousuke is one of the three children who survived the destruction of Ootsuka village 5 years prior. He did not have relatives and thus was raised with http://anidb.net/ch49442 [Shino] and http://anidb.net/ch49444 [Hamaji], the other two survivors, as if they were siblings.
He has a peony-shaped birthmark on the back of his neck. Ever since the accident he has an ability to transform into the dog Yoshiro, who makes up half of himself.
His real other half is manifested in Ao, his shadow, causing Sousuke`s memories and body parts to be split between the two. This causes Sousuke to not remember everything from his past, as well as slowly losing the ability to feel pain, and the sight in his left eye.
He is the holder of the Duty bead.</description>

Unlike her pretty appearance, she often manipulates Shino and Sousuke, but in heart, she cares about them.

The buck has been slain by Ao, who is now a vessel to him. The seal of Yana on his left upper arm is proof of that.
Later Murasame eats the spirit, making Shino bear the seal.
Yana takes form as a huge two-headed dragon when whole. It`s original duty was to grant the wish of its vessel. Instead over the years the vessel has become the fullfiller of wishes for the villagers.
After becoming whole again and fullfilling its original duty, Yana was bound to vanish, instead it was able to live on in Ao, requested by Shino.</description>

Since Yana Hime knows them for so long, she sees them as her siblings and not just her guardians.
She carries the seal of Yana, the local deity, on her body since birth. Because of that she is not able to leave the shrine. The villagers call her the living god, as well as Yana`s bride. Yana Hime never knew her parents, nor the day she was born. When she dies, there will be another child born with the seal, and become a living vessel.</description>

<description>There are four Houses, the animals of those houses being the fox, the wolf, the snake, and the cat (or panther in this case), called the Four Sacred Beast Houses. The wielders of the Sacred Beasts are very powerful and tend to be feared, which is why the Church chose to take them in; so that they could control them. The wielders also tend to be ostracized by their families, even being called disgraces for some reason, so they are usually alone except for each other. The members are chosen by the beasts before their birth, and protect them from then on. They all live together in a huge mansion.</description>
