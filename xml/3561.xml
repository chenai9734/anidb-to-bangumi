<description>In the third movie, the classical Japan-Europe match becomes intercontinental. This time they arrange a world cup with 4 teams: Japan, USA, "All Europe", and "All South America". In the first match, Japan easily defeats the USA 3:0 and in the second match Europe loses 2:3 against South America. In the final round S.A. shows their "soccer cyborg" Carlos Santana, a more than supreme player who seems to be undefeatable. All their classical tricks like Hyugas "Tiger Shot" or Tsubasas "Top Spin" seem to be totally worthless, but in a hard and spectacular match the Japanese learn more and more to play in unison and finally they get the win.

Note: While it is in fact the fourth movie, in some countries this movie was released and named the third movie.</description>

<name>association football</name>
<description>Football is a sport that involves kicking a ball in order to score a goal, while the other team tries to stop you by kicking the ball in the other direction to score a goal of their own. In the United States, this sport is known as soccer; the inappropriately titled "American" football (which in fact is played with the egg-shaped "ball" being carried around) is some kind of rugby for babies.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Wakabayashi Genzou is an extroardinary goalkeeper who can catch almost anything thrown at him. Not many shots can come past Genzou. A charismatic guy, Genzou is also loyal to his friends and he is firm with his decisions. Genzou always keeps his feelings to himself and people close to him as seen in Shin Captain Tsubasa, when he`s willingly criticize his teammates` performance in order to make them realize that football in Europe is different than what they play in Japan. His actions caused a lot of Japanese players to dislike him and Genzou only told Tsubasa his true intentions. From early childhood, he has aimed to be the best goalkeeper in the world. He tended to be selfish, and brag about his skills before he met and played a couple of games against Tsubasa. After his match against Tsubasa, he has learned to enjoy the game with his other teammates.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>To help his family, Hyuuga Kojirou wants to be a professional player, an ace striker. His devotion to football and his persistence to shoot the goal is outstanding. He was both Tsubasa`s and Genzou`s top rival. A great guy, Hyuuga is not only strong, he is also tough but at the same time caring. Can be a bit impulsive at times, though. He was once famous because of his roughness and many players were scared of him. But, Hyuuga is actually a kind boy who cares about his family and friends. In the World Youth series, Hyuuga was one of the 7 players to be excluded from the Japanese National team after they lost 3 group matches with Real Japan 7 (R.J.7). Determined to get back into the team, Hyuuga developed a new shot, the Raijuu shot, a shot which is a bit similar to Tsubasa`s Drive Shoot, except that Hyuuga`s Raijuu Shot is a ground shot that will curve upward, unlike Tsubasa`s Drive Shooter which will go up then curve downward.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The "Karate Keeper", Wakashimazu Ken is a goalkeeper on par with http://anidb.net/ch2084 [Wakabayashi Genzou], but more offense-oriented. As his nickname implies, he is an expert karateka since his father is the master of a dojo. His father originally disapproved his efforts to become a footballer and his opposition to become the heir of the dojo.
Wakashimazu became interested in football when http://anidb.net/ch8344 [Hyuuga Kojirou] invited him to join the Meiwa team after being impressed by his abilities in a one-on-one duel that Wakashimazu lost. Since then, they are close friends.
Despite being an excellent goalkeeper, he originally was a forward and only became goalkeeper because Meiwa didn`t have competent goalkeepers.
A reliable partner of Hyuga while in the Meiwa and Toho teams, he and Wakabayashi regularly alternate in the goalkeeper position with the Japanese team.</description>
