<description>Under the scorching summer sun, the chirping of cicadas can be heard at a school building. A young girl is crouching down with her back turned to you. The girl notices you there, stands up, and starts talking to you. “Ever since that summer, I`ve been waiting for you...” The truth about “that summer” slowly becomes clear as she speaks. The person I wanted to see was the person I must not see... An original work created for VR.</description>
