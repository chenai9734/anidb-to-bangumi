<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<description>Space Travel usually refers going to space or travelling there with or without a spacecraft. There are different forms of space travel like Interplanetary travel, Interstellar travel or Intergalactic travel. Since it isn`t possible to travel faster than light, most anime series involve some sort "sub-space travel mechanism" as a way to travel faster than light.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>parallel world</name>
<description>A parallel world, parallel universe, or alternative reality is a self-contained separate reality coexisting with our own. Because "alternative reality" sometimes implies that the reality is a variant of our own, like for example a mirror world, we use the term "parallel world/universe" which is more general, without any connotations implying a relationship (or lack thereof) with our own world/universe (meaning a fictional world can just as well have an alternative reality, it doesn`t need to be our reality). To put it more simply, this category is to show if more than 1 world/universe/reality is present in the anime.
Multiple timelines of the same world/universe/reality are NOT considered parallel worlds. For example, in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate] the cast travels through multiple "World Lines", which are defined as parallel timelines of the same universe had various events occurred with differing outcomes.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>adventure</name>
<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

Yuuko has mentioned that the Mokonas were created a very long time ago by herself and Clow Reed, in preparation for a future event - the arrival and subsequent journey of the Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle group - as well as to stop Fei Wong Reed`s plans and save "two futures".</description>

<description>Sakura`s given name (桜) means "cherry blossom". Her surname, Kinomoto (木之本), literally means "the origin of wood".
At the start of the series, Sakura is 10 years old and living in a fictional town called Tomoeda in Japan, located not far from Tokyo. One day in early April, shortly after her birthday and only slightly into her fourth grade year at Tomoeda Elementary School, young Sakura stumbles across a mysterious old book called The Clow in her father`s study. Instantly upon touching the book, a confused Sakura mistakenly awakens one of the card`s guardians, Cerberus who was sleeping on the front cover where he was supposed to be guarding the Clow Cards: a deck of 52 magical cards with incredible powers. Upon emerging from the book, Cerberus admits to having let the cards slip away as he slumbered, and, realizing Sakura`s magical potential, cunningly tricks her into becoming the "Cardcaptor" and duty bound to collect all of the missing cards and return them to the book where they will then be under her control.</description>

She had been living with her grandparents in Wakayama while she went to elementary school, but saved up money that her mother had been sending her while she was away so she could afford to go to middle school in Tokyo. She worries about the fact that she is small and nonathletic, and is sometimes mistaken to be in elementary school, but sees Angelic Layer as a way to prove to others and herself that there is nothing wrong with being small. She started playing Angelic Layer after seeing the white angel Athena on a video screen outside of Tokyo Station. Her angel is Hikaru and she is known as the "Miracle Rookie". She is nicknamed Misakichi (みさきち) by her friend Tamayo to make her name sound cute.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kept asleep in a liquid chamber at Fei Wong Reed`s palace, with his left eye covered by an eyepatch, his hands and arms by binding spells and wearing clothes marking Fei Wong Reed`s bat symbol. In fact, this Shaoran is the original while the Shaoran at Sakura`s side is only a clone that Fei Wong Reed created. This Shaoran is of Clow Reed`s bloodline, the son of Sakura and Shaoran from another dimension (from CCS), and can thus use magic.
He gave his eye and with it half of his heart to his clone to stop Fei Wong`s plan temporarily, hoping that this action could create a true heart in the clone. Because he had given his eye Shaoran was able to witness all the events the clone did. He was depicted as a villain (it was believed that he was controlling the clone`s actions, while it was only the clone`s true nature showing) until it was discovered that the protagonist Shaoran is his clone. Now the real Shaoran is the story`s protagonist. This Shaoran is able to summon a sword, the same one used by his father and he also uses the same spells.</description>

<name>Shaoran</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>An excellent martial artist and an aspiring archaeologist with extensive knowledge of various languages, histories, and artefacts. His right eye is blind; sometimes, in mysterious dreams, he can see out of the eye and look at a person he recognises as himself in endless mirrors. Shaoran was found in his childhood wandering the streets without a memory, before he was discovered and adopted by Fujitaka (Sakura`s father in Cardcaptor Sakura), who recently passed away, leaving his foster son to continue his great work. He obtained his sword Hien during his stay at Ooto, which he learned to use from Kurogane, and learned his fighting abilities from now-enemy Seishirou, who can also travel between worlds and says he is looking for vampires.
As a clone, he has no mind or consciousness and exists only to collect all of Sakura`s feathers and to return them to her. Of all the clones created by Fei Wong Reed, he is the closest to what Fei Wong Reed intended. Although he has no magic of his own, he does, however, possess the ability to store and use magic. After the real Shaoran was released and arrived in Tokyo to face him the clone gouged out one of Fay`s eyes in order to absorb his magical power.</description>

<name>Sakura</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The Princess of Clow Country. Sakura is a cheerful, selfless, and stronghearted being. She states if there was ever something that she could do, she would try her absolute best. She possesses a mysterious power, namely her "wings" that can actually change the world, though no-one understands what that means. Her wings are the manifestation of her soul, namely her heart and memories. She is targeted by Fei Wong for that very power. After losing her memories, Shaoran gave up their relationship in order to save her. Meaning, even if she regains all of her memories, the one that she would never retrieve would be the knowledge of Shaoran`s existence. She is unusually excellent at games of chance, whether it`s her mysterious power or, as Chun Hyang mentioned in the Country of Koryo, extremely lucky from being "a favourite of the gods," meaning she gets such good fortune from being one of the gods` favourite daughters. Her main goal is to find the clone of Shaoran, who has now separated from the group.</description>

<description>A rough-mannered ninja from the world of Nihon, a world based on ancient (Japan), exiled for his recklessness. He originally possessed the replica of Ginryuu, a sword, before giving it to Yuuko as price for his deal with her. He obtained a new sword in Ooto called the Souhi, and taught Shaoran the skills of sword fighting and sensing attacks from the left. In the grand scheme of the series, he is considered `Yuuko`s pawn`. Fei Wong Reed murdered Kurogane`s mother in an attempt to make a deal with him, his servitude for the return of his mother. However, this plan was thwarted by Yuuko and Tomoyo when Yuuko warns Tomoyo of this event. This warning leads to Tomoyo ending Kurogane`s mad rampage and Kurogane becoming one of her ninjas. He also acquired the Ginryuu replica from Tomoyo as the original was to be buried with his mother in place of his father`s corpse.</description>

<description>Syaoran is a distant relative of Clow Reed (on Clow`s mother`s side), the creator of the Clow Cards. As a member of the Li clan of sorcerers from Hong Kong, of which Clow`s mother was a member, Syaoran believes that he should be the one to inherit the Clow Cards, not Sakura Kinomoto. He first appears as an antagonist in the story, capturing a few cards for himself in the anime (though none in the manga). He acted cold and nonchalant to Sakura. He never even says her name until the third season. As the series progresses, and especially after Sakura is officially deemed the new master of the Cards, Syaoran drops his rivalistic attitude towards her and becomes her ally and friend, eventually falling in love with her. However, Sakura is completely oblivious to these feelings and thinks of him simply as a close friend.</description>

Once Cerberus is awakened (he was napping on the front cover) and released from the book he discovers the Clow cards have vanished, and appoints Sakura the title of Cardcaptor, and sends her off to retrieve the cards.</description>

<name>Ashura</name>
<gender>none/does not apply</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The protagonist of the series and the last living member of the Ashura clan, Ashura was born after Taishakuten had killed his father and seized the throne. His mother, Shashi, at the same time gave birth to Taishakuten`s son Ten-Ou, and tried to kill Ashura, whom she believed must stand in her way to rule Heaven at Taishakuten`s side. However, Ashura`s powers protected him and enclosed him in a cocoon where he slept undisturbed for three hundred years, until Yasha-Ou awoke him.
Upon being freed from his cocoon, Ashura first appears as a baby, but grows rapidly to a child of maybe eight years. At first outgoing and friendly, he soon becomes aware of his cruel destiny, as Taishakuten has almost everyone with whom he has associated killed. Feeling guilty for their deaths, he vows to become strong enough to defeat Taishakuten himself.
However, Ashura has another side: He is, in fact, the "true Ashura", the merciless god of war whose wish is the total destruction of Heaven, Earth and Hell. This side was suppressed by several seals, one of which is the distribution of his true power among the Six Stars, but is freed upon their meeting. Only his love for Yasha-Ou, his adoptive father, finally triumphs over his lust for destruction.
As a punishment for his father`s sin, Ashura was born genderless so he cannot continue the royal line of Ashura, which Ashura-Ou so desperately wished to preserve that he tried to defy destiny. Languages which do not have a gender-neutral pronoun usually refer to him by either the male or the female pronoun; the choice of either is often a source of much contention.</description>

<description>Head of the Yasha clan and one of the strongest warriors in Tenkai, Yasha-Ou serves as the bushinshou of the north. Wanting to prove his friend Kuy-Ou the stargazer`s prophecy, he awoke Ashura and became his protector even though she had also predicted that Ashura would kill him and knowing that this act of rebellion would anger Taishakuten. As a result of his not turning over Ashura to Taishakuten, his entire clan was declared renegade and slaughtered by Bishamonten.
When Yasha-Ou was still a child, Ashura-Ou (knowing that Yasha was the one who would awaken Ashura) asked him what he would do if the most important person in the world to him was fated to bring him disaster. Yasha replied that he would "protect him". Ashura-Ou then told him to become strong so as to protect the one thing that he would value above all others in the future. His real name is Yama, having taken the name of Yasha-Ou when he became the leader of his tribe.</description>

<description>Queen of the Kendappa tribe in the east, Kendappa-Ou is the royal musician. Despite her favoured position at Taishakuten`s court, she hid Souma in her flying castle after her tribe was wiped out and also helped Yasha-Ou and Ashura when they passed through her kingdom. However, she does not believe that the Six Stars can triumph over Taishakuten, who she says is the strongest person in Heaven. Instead of allying herself with her friends, she reveals herself to be one of Taishakuten`s shitennou, Jikokuten, the shitennou and bushinshou of the East - a position her father had held before being killed by Taishakuten. Impressed with Taishakuten`s strength, the only trait which she admires, she swore herself to his service when she was just a small child. Her harp, her constant companion, serves also as the hiding place for her sword.
Unable to go back on her word, believing that all of the Six Stars will be killed anyway, she decides to kill Souma, whom she is in love with, herself. She commits suicide right after, saying there is no point in living in Heaven without her.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kohaku is a rather accident-prone angel who has come to Earth in search of her mentor, Hisui. When she gets trapped in a tree and attacked by a crow, she is rescued by Shuichirou, a young doctor. As a result, she feels indebted to grant him one wish but finds the kind doctor is satisfied with all aspects of his life. Thus, she remains with Shuichirou in hopes of repaying him somehow (subsequently getting in other sticky situations as a result).
Because she is only a trainee angel, Kohaku can only maintain a full-size form during the day - at night she shrinks and is only about a foot tall, looking rather like a chibi character. As an angel, she cannot consume anything that came directly from a living organism (ie meat, vegetables, bread) with the sole exception being milk and occasionally honey.
Note: Although most resemble stereotypical bishounen, the angels in Wish are genderless. However, in the English translation, they are assigned male or female genders, to avoid calling them "it".</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Fuu is a very demure but very intelligent young girl (though this goes more for book-smarts than street-smarts) who hails from a prep school and is generally the voice of reason.
Always very polite and considerate, she frequently speaks formally, even to Hikaru and Umi, though she sometimes has her comic moments (occasional weird quips and her tendency to chat with Umi on off-topic matters). Still, she is a valuable friend and trusted ally.
Fuu adapts relatively easily to Cephiro, seeing it much like a role-playing game (a favorite pastime of hers). She is part of an archery club, so she shows skill with her initial weapon: a bow and arrow. But interestingly, Fuu`s Magic Sword turns out to be a huge broadsword that is taller than she is. Fortunately, its magic powers also make it light enough for her to wield.
Fuu is the second to revive her Guardian, and she has fallen in love with the mysterious swordsman Ferio.
She is the Magic Knight of Wind and her name translates to "Wind of the Phoenix Temple".</description>

<description>Umi is the only child of a rich family and goes to a school for "privileged" girls.
She is quick-tempered and at first uncaring and selfish, though perhaps the best-suited for the task at hand, but is also the most reluctant. As Magic Knight Rayearth progresses, she starts to care for other people and better understand the Magic Knights` situation. Perhaps this is because she is a "privileged" girl.
Interestingly enough Umi is the first Magic Knight to revive her Guardian.
She is the Magic Knight of Water and her name translates to "Sea Dragon Blossom".</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Hikaru is pretty much what you expect in an anime redhead: fire in her eyes, energetic and assertive almost to the point of aggressiveness. She`s a girl of action.
She`s also a girl of emotional extremes. She`s normally upbeat and happy all the time. Having a dog back home, she takes to the cute Mokona instantly. She is however vulnerable to bouts of deep depression, especially when something really shakes her to the core. She also looks a little young for her age and is a bit naive.
Hikaru is the most willing of the three (at first) to become a Magic Knight, and Hikaru`s magic sword is the most traditional, resembling a broadsword.
Her family runs a kendo dojo, so she`s the quickest to get into the swing of things.
Interestingly, though, she`s the last to revive her Guardian (Rayearth).
She is the Magic Knight of Fire and her name translates to "Light of the Lion Shrine".</description>
