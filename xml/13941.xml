<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>Riko</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Riko is a trouble-prone 12-year-old girl who wants to emulate her late mother, a legendary Cave Raider named http://anidb.net/ch89868 [Lyza] the Annihilator who disappeared in the Abyss ten years ago.
Currently she is a Cave Raider-in-training at the Belchero Orphanage, and as a rookie bears the rank of Red Whistle. She has secretly taken possession of one of her finds, the Star Compass, which she hopes to use in her exploration of the Abyss.
Her need for glasses results from an effect from the Curse of the Abyss, which she caught while her then-pregnant mother went on a descent and Riko was born inside the Abyss.

His mechanic arms can shoot and extend to grab hard to reach objects as well as shooting out a deadly straight heat beam that can melt objects at a distance which Riko names "Incinerator".

Dropped to and retrieved from the sixth layer along a young girl and close friend called http://anidb.net/ch91602 [Mitty], http://anidb.net/ch91601 [Nanachi] became partially inhuman, with their features becoming somewhat rabbit-like. Since escaping from Bondrewd`s facility, they have devoted their life to caring for http://anidb.net/ch91497 [Mitty], who lost all of her humanity and became a grotesque, immortal assortment of flesh and misshapen limbs. Even before being transformed into a Hollow, Nanachi always used gender-neutral pronouns and Nanachi`s gender was never stated.
