<description>* The omnibus film contains eight short anime segments from production studios http://anidb.net/cr755 [Bones] (Prototype), Casio Entertainment (The Package), http://anidb.net/cr721 [Production I.G] (The Duel), http://anidb.net/cr749 [Bee Train] (Homecoming), http://anidb.net/cr738 [Studio 4°C] (Origins, The Babysitter), and http://anidb.net/cr1834 [Toei Animation] (Odd One Out).
Prototype (13 minutes — animation by Studios Bones) — Troubled by his inability to protect the junior members of his strike team, the sole survivor of the mission is still haunted by terrible nightmares. Assigned to a new unit, sergeant Ghost finds himself caught up in a bloody offensive by the Covenant. In desperation, he defies his mission orders and uses a prototype armoured-suit to provide covering fire to allow the rest of his team to withdraw safely. But his orders are for him to destroy the suit and he does not intend to disobey...
The Package (14 minutes — animation by Casio Entertainment) — A small group of genetically enhanced soldiers known as Spartans are sent on a near impossible mission to recover an important item known as "the package" that is hidden somewhere within a Covenant fleet.
The Duel (15 minutes — animation by Production I.G) — A soldier of the Covenant questions the actions of the elders and finds himself accused of dissension and branded as a traitor. With only his honour to guide him, he finds himself battling members of his tribe while remembering the troubling events that led him to this situation.
Homecoming (15 minutes — animation by Production I.G) — While defending the battered remnants of a distant colony, a group of soldiers are surrounded by Covenant forces and face defeat, only to find themselves rescued by a Spartan warrior. The story of their desperate withdrawal is broken by flashbacks of how the Spartan warrior came to be assigned such a hopeless mission.
Origins I (10+ minutes, animation by Studio 4°C) — A researcher studying some ancient ruins files a report that tells of how one hundred thousand years ago, an ancient race known only as the Forerunners found themselves facing an enemy they called the Flood. The Flood behaved like a virus, feeding on sentient life and was apparently unstoppable. Facing their imminent defeat, they created a terrible weapon called the HALO and set in motion a number of events that would one day give rise to the other races.
Origins II (12+ minutes — animation by Studio 4°C) — The rise of humanity and their ability to travel the stars has not settled their disharmony and aggressiveness. Only when confronted with destruction by an alien enemy called the Covenant do they find a unity of purpose, as they struggle to protect and preserve the human race. But the rise of an ancient enemy soon overshadows the differences between Humanity and the Covenant, and forces the two races to share a common goal.
Odd One Out (11+ minutes — animation by Toei Animation) — A Spartan solder named 1337 becomes stranded on an isolated planet where he encounters a group of human kids and has to fight off a Covenant super warrior.
The Babysitter (18+ minutes — animation by Studio 4°C) — An elite ODST team is tasked with infiltrating a Covenant controlled planet and assassinating a Covenant Prophet, but they are unhappy that the strike will be under the command of a newly assigned Spartan.
Note: Several episodes were initially aired on Halo Waypoint (a central hub for Halo content on Xbox Live) as a promotion prior to the DVD/BD release on 16.02.2010. These episodes were The Babysitter, The Duel, The Package (aired in 2 parts on different dates) and Origins I. The episode ordering was different for the DVD/BD release, and used the following line-up: 4-5, 2, 6, 8, 7, 1, 3.</description>

<description>The military, also known as the armed forces, are forces authorized and legally entitled to use deadly force so as to support the interests of the state and its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its citizens and the prosecution of war against foreign powers. The military may also have additional functions within a society, including construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding critical areas.

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>content indicators</name>
<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<description>Space Travel usually refers going to space or travelling there with or without a spacecraft. There are different forms of space travel like Interplanetary travel, Interstellar travel or Intergalactic travel. Since it isn`t possible to travel faster than light, most anime series involve some sort "sub-space travel mechanism" as a way to travel faster than light.</description>

<description>The anime will fit this category if some or all of the action takes place on another planet which is supposedly in the same universe as Earth, not a complete fantasy world; usually there has to be some concept of space travel. The Latin name for Earth - Terra, would also pass the condition of being in the same universe as Earth. Basically, even mentioning of Earth existing or having existed would be enough.

<description>Humanoids are aliens, intelligent beings who do not originate from Earth, but have a striking similarity to humans or at least show the basic body layout, i.e. two arms and legs, head with two eyes and ears, one nose and mouth.

<description>Parasites are life forms that feed off other beings in some way. In anime, they are often aliens and usually intelligent. For shock value, and to avoid having to draw aliens all the time, their prey is preferably human; they may see humans as food, as puppets for mind control, or simply as temporary body hosts. In every case, the human is the victim of a "merging", which is not to be confused with the more "amicable" symbiosis.</description>

The level of modification will vary from subtle changes in "look" (e.g. super-human beauty), to mental enhancements (PSI powers), to more or less atrocious adaptations to extreme environments (breath under water, radiation resistance). Note that changes in Aliens would be difficult to pinpoint, after all they are alien.</description>

<description>The lead female character has a strong personality and plays a part that is not the typical damsel-in-distress role. 
This is the exact opposite of the “damsel in distress” tag.</description>

<name>episodic</name>
<description>An episodic anime consists of many successive short arcs that are generally 1-2 episodes in length, with strong plot continuity within each arc but generally little continuity from one arc to the next. For long shows (well upwards of 50 episodes), the episode count constraint is less tight; for example, a show with close to 250 episodes would also be considered episodic if it consisted of a majority of arcs of up to 3 or maybe 4 episodes and possibly also very few slightly longer arcs.</description>
