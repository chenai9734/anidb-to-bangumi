<name>Mithril</name>

<charactertype id="3">Organization</charactertype>
<description>Mithril is a paramilitary (non-governmental) organization possessing advanced technologies and weapon systems superior to that of any national armed forces. It was founded around 1992-1993, following the detonation of a nuclear warhead in northern Iraq in the then waning Gulf War. It is named after the fictional metal, Mithril, from the The Lord of the Rings written by J. R. R. Tolkien. The organization`s purpose to halt regional conflicts, in addition to securing the Whispered. As such, it is one of the few organizations aware of the Whispered and Black Technology.
Mithril remains an extremely secretive organization, its existence unknown to all but the most senior of military and political personnel. Its motives, funding, structure, and personnel are all kept secret. Its secrecy is vital for its continued existence, as Mithril is a specialist organization dependent on fast surgical strikes with small numbers. They do not possess the numbers or capacity to withstand a conventional war of numbers.
The story of Full Metal Panic primarily follows one section of Mithril, the Pacific Fleet Battle Group Tuatha de Danaan.</description>
