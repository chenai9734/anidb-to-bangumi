<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="272004">Totally underrated, just the spoofs of both openings and endings alone make this show well worth your time. Still, I`d say it`s really just for fans of the main show, because outside of that context, this spin-off is just not as funny.</recommendation>
</recommendations>

Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>comedy</name>
<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>STAFF MISSING</name>
<description>This anime is missing staff credits. If you can, please assign staff credits to the anime accordingly and then remove the tag.
If the tag is set on an anime level, please assign preferably all credits and then remove it from the anime. If that is not feasible, please assign, at a minimum, credits for all the major/key staff and then transfer it to all relevant episodes (broadly speaking, regular episodes and S-type episodes containing animation). If the tag is already set on an episode level, please assign all credits, including minor staff, to the episode and then remove the tag from it.
Likewise, this tag should either be applied on an anime level, when it is missing key staff (in full or in part), or to all relevant episodes, when key staff is present but at least some episodes don`t have full staff.
For further information on assigning staff credits, please see http://wiki.anidb.net/Content:Staff_Credits [the AniDB Wiki article on them].</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Cocytus is the Guardian of the 5th Floor of Nazarick.
Cocytus is the personal creation of Warrior Takemikazuchi, one of the 41 members of Ainz Ooal Gown. Cocytus was created to personify the perfect warrior both in body and spirit. Cocytus is loyal to a fault to the Supreme Beings but he`s not just a dumb muscle and is willing to learn in to better serve his lord. Amongst the denizen of Nazarick, he`s more accepting of outsiders provided they share the same strength, honor, and warrior spirit that he epitomizes.
Cocytus design is based on the Gelugon, a type of ice-devil from D&amp;D. He has the highest offensive capabilities of melee fighters in Nazarick backed up by ice-elemental skills. Cocytus have no need for armor as his exoskeleton serves as a living armor. His creator, Warrior Takemikazuchi, has equipped Cocytus with many of his own personally crafted weapons and has programmed Cocytus with the knowledge of all of the Divine Weapons own by the Supreme Beings.
Cocytus seems to prefer the company of other insectoids like him from Nazarick. He also hold good relations with Demiurge and often asks the demon for advice too difficult for himself to understand.</description>

<description>Shalltear Bloodfallen is the first, second and third floor guardian. She is a true vampire and the Floor Guardian of the first to third floors in the Great Tomb of Nazarick. She was created by Peroroncino.
Shalltear is the strongest of the floor guardians and is completely loyal to Ainz and is also a love rival to Albedo for his affections. She takes great joy in being able to prove her worth and fantasizes about the praise she expects to receive. When a situation doesn`t go in her favor, she panics about the scolding she believes that she will get.

<description>Demiurge is the Guardian of the 7th Floor of the Great Tomb of Nazarick.
Demiurge is the personal creation of Ulbert Alain Odle, one of the 41 members of Ainz Ooal Gown. Ulbert created Demiurge as the personification of evil. As such, Demiurge relish in acts that embodies this twisted morality scripted onto him. He is cruel and uniformly incompassionate to all beings who do not belong to the Tomb of Nazarick and thinks little more of them than tools and toys to amuse himself with. However, to all of his comrades, Demiurge demonstrate true care and loyalty. Demiurge suffers an existential crisis, more than other denizens of Nazarick, due to his fear of losing Ainz Ooal Gown as the last remaining Supreme Being.
Demiurge is amongst the weakest of the Floor Guardian in pure destructive power. However, he has an extremely high intellect and excel at long term strategic planning. Often, he can predict the actions of people with high standing on a national level and equally high hubris down to the exact detail. Though his own personal power is low, Demiurge commands the Demon Lords, a group of high level subordinate whom themselves command legions of inferno demons.
Though he`ll get along with anyone who`s a comrade in Nazarick, Demiurge have an unexplained dislike of Sebas Tian. Unbeknownst to both NPCs, they`ve inherited the conflict from the personal dispute of their own creators.</description>

She`s a doppelganger and http://anidb.net/ch76797 [Momon]`s companion in their adventurers` guild, Darkness. She was chosen as one due to her most human-looking appearance out of all other maids. As an adventurer, she refers to herself as Nabe.
Like most of http://anidb.net/ch95428 [Nazarick] residents, she holds great disdain towards humans. This often proves troublesome, as she becomes incredibly violent when human males make advances on her.</description>

<name>Ainz Ooal Gown</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Momonga is the guildmaster and only remaining active player of the guild Ainz Ooal Gown from the DMMORPG game Yggdrasil, once one of the top guilds in the game. When the guild`s base, the Underground Tomb of Nazarick, was transported to an alternate reality and a new world, Momonga soon assumed for himself the name of Ainz Ooal Gown and began a campaign to make his guild legendary, subsequently turning to world domination.
When he was still human and an Yggdrasil player, Ainz was an adult man already jaded by life, making him prone to analyse things from his perspective as a company worker. In the new world, his game avatar, an undead lich, became his real body, along with all the physical characteristics such a body would have; as a result, he is nigh immune to strong emotions and worldly temptations and desires, because his status as an undead physically shuts them down.
Ainz is calculating, subversive, and cowardly when approaching or in the imminence of a battle, placing his continued survival, as well as that of the guild and its NPCs, who gained life with the transfer, above all else, and planning many moves ahead; once his plans are set in motion, he is ruthlessly efficient in their execution, and will not bat an eyelid at slaying his opponents when pressed. His actions are vicious and ruthless towards any and all that oppose him, and he is motivated by his own gains and survival and the glory of his guild`s name. His greatest weakness is his great fear of not being recognized as a proper leader by the guild`s NPCs, causing him to play along with their plans when he does not understand them simply to not be forced to admit to them that he is not following what they have in mind.</description>

<description>Clementine is a rogue warrior from Zuranon and a former member of the Black Scripture, the strongest scripture in the Slane Theocracy.
Before she went rogue, Clementine held the 7th seat in the Black Scripture. Betraying the Scripture, she stole the magical Crown of Wisdom from one of the six Shaman-Princesses of the Theocracy, forcing her to flee and join Zuranon.
She is thought to be one of the strongest in the Slane Theocracy since she was a member of the Black Scripture, which is the strongest Scripture in the Slane Theocracy. She is stronger than Hamsuke, Gazef, and Brain, although Gazef can overwhelm her if he were to use use all of his magic items. However, if she were to get the equipment she had when she was in the Black Scripture, even Gazef with full gear could not defeat her.

Her face is actually a bug shell that hides her true face, while she disguises her voice with that of a cute girl by using a leech that can mimic a human`s voice. Her original voice, which she dislikes using is harsh and grating, similar to that of http://anidb.net/ch72779 [Cocytus]. She harbors a big grudge against an adventurer named http://anidb.net/ch93725 [Evileye] who used anti-bug magic to destroy her cute voice in battle.

In Momonga`s original design, he`s the combination of everything that he thought was cool, with exaggerated gestures and body language but now that he is actually alive, he embarrasses Momonga. Despite his appearance and personality, he is on the same level as the Floor Guardians and is considered as intelligent as http://anidb.net/ch72778 [Albedo] and http://anidb.net/ch72782 [Demiurge]. He is granted permission to secretly call Ainz his father—secretly he does not want rumors of favoritism to spread.
