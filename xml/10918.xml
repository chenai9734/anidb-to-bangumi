<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="748358">As you can imagine by its premise, this is a peculiar romance anime. The love story of a giant guy with a golden heart and a beautiful, but naive and clumsy, girl. In the middle of it are the other characters, which I felt were well-scripted but also capable of distracting from the main plot, which in its essence its a standard romcom plot with the aforementioned added element of an intimidating, physically ugly main lead. Comedy is good, but it is also heavily based on the main lead, so it can get repetitive at times. It ending its open, but I guess it is adequate. The series runs for 24 episodes, a length normally reserved for complex romance series, and I think this is one of them, in some ways.

So how to recommend such anime? Well, I`m with sammy123, in the sense that this is for veteran romance fans, and I can see casual viewers finding it over the top and all over the place. So yeah, it is recommended for seasoned fans.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="834921">The first anime to make me literally cry.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="162292">This story is one of the best I have seen since years...
I can’t remember the last time, when I was laughing  so much all by myself...
It’s a quite simple story, but still very inspiring. You really feel the characters.
Makes you feel better about life... guaranteed.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="784472">Charming romance story about a man, his friend and a cute girl who likes to bake. Very wholesome and relatively drama-free.
If you`re sick of shows that focus on getting to the relationship and want one that`s more about feeling out boundaries once it`s been established, I don`t think there`s a better anime high school romance out there. Added bonus of having some of the best reaction images of all time.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="623957">Thank you for being born into this world.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="66097">I highly recommend this anime.  Normally you see animes where the protagonists are all beautiful and nearly untouchable.  Here we have the main character being a big burly guy who is very naive and sweet yet he is easily misunderstood.  The guys idolize him &amp; the girls find him revolting and would rather have his best friend "Suna" look their way.

It`s an excellent watch and if you get the chance to see the live-action movie adaption of the series, then do so.  In my opinion, they took one of the best parts of the anime and manga &amp; put it into the after credits scene.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="138560">This was a great anime. It was so refreshing to see not only a not-traditionally handsome guy get the girl through just being great, but it was unusual and awesome that there were actual family dynamics in this series. Watching Takeo interact with his parents and with his baby sister was the best backdrop that I`ve seen in forever. Finally, an anime where family members aren`t just a setting but have actual characters of their own.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="306510">A feel good romance anime with absolutely lovable characters - what more could a romance fan want? :)</recommendation>

Used to being on the sidelines, Takeo simply stands tall and accepts his fate. But one day when he saves a girl named http://anidb.net/ch72036 [Yamato] from a harasser on the train, his (love!) life suddenly takes an incredible turn!

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>Sometimes normal just doesn`t cut it. Eating: you put food in your mouth and chew. Playing sports: you throw a ball around. You need to make it awesome, no matter how mundane it is.
Let`s throw in some gripping orchestral music, lighting changes, different camera angles, something! Don`t write like a man, write like an evil overlord! Exaggerate your expressions and gestures, speak with excessive intonation, and if all else fails, throw in some close-ups, slow motion, and ominous Latin chanting! With practice, even you can turn something like eating chips into an epic battle of light and dark, blinding the viewer with sheer awesomeness.

In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth`s surface, variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.
During May, June, and July, the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun. The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December, January, and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere.
In temperate and subpolar regions, four calendar-based seasons (with their adjectives) are generally recognized: spring (vernal), summer (estival), autumn (autumnal), fall and winter (hibernal). Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring (prevernal) and late summer (serotinal) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four.

<name>spring</name>
<description>During spring, the axis of the Earth is increasing its tilt relative to the Sun, and the length of daylight rapidly increases for the relevant hemisphere. The hemisphere begins to warm significantly causing new plant growth to spring forth, giving the season its name. Snow, if a normal part of winter, begins to melt, and streams swell with runoff. Frosts, if a normal part of winter, become less severe. In climates that have no snow and rare frosts, the air and ground temperatures increase more rapidly. Many flowering plants bloom this time of year, in a long succession sometimes beginning when snow is still on the ground, continuing into early summer. In normally snowless areas spring may begin as early as February (Northern Hemisphere) heralded by the blooming of deciduous magnolias, cherries and quince, or August (Southern Hemisphere) in the same way. Many temperate areas have a dry spring, and wet autumn (fall), which brings about flowering in this season more consistent with the need for water as well as warmth. Subarctic areas may not experience spring at all until May or even June.
