<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<description>Any anime that is based on a role-playing game aka RPG. A role-playing video game is a video game which includes elements of non-electronic role-playing games. The player assumes control of one or several fictional characters (a party) who have joined forces in order to perform quests and overcome a great number of challenges and enemies, usually monsters inspired by fantasy, and, to a lesser extent, science fiction and classic mythology. During the course of the game the characters, or avatars, which are generally defined by quantized characteristics, evolve and improve in that their various attributes increase, as well as by gaining more powerful artefacts.</description>

<description>Pinsir is a bug-type stag beetle Pokémon covered with a thick exoskeleton. Its large pincers are adorned with sharp spikes which serve to damage foes caught in the pincers and to prevent escape. If it fails to crush its foe, it will throw the foe powerfully against the ground or into another object with its pincers. Pinsir requires warm habitats to survive. It becomes immobilized in cold climates. It burrows itself into dirt using its pincers and sleeps in the burrow through the night.</description>

<description>Eevee is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves into one of eight different Pokémon through various methods. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Eevee is the game mascot and starter Pokémon in Pokémon: Let`s Go, Eevee!, as well as for the main characters of Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness and Pokémon Conquest. It is also the rival`s starter Pokémon in Pokémon Yellow, although Professor Oak originally intended to give it to the player.
Eevee is a mammalian, quadruped Pokémon with primarily brown fur. The tip of its bushy tail and its large furry collar are cream-colored. It has short, slender legs with three small toes and a pink paw pad on each foot. Eevee has brown eyes, long pointed ears with dark brown interiors, and a small black nose. Eevee is rarely found in the wild and is mostly only found in cities and towns. However, Eevee is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure that is easily influenced by its environment. This allows it to adapt to a variety of habitats by evolving. Eevee is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Extreme Evoboost.
In Pokémon: Let`s Go, Eevee!, the player starts with a special Eevee known as a Partner Eevee. The Partner Eevee has purple eyes and a lighter shade of fur. These design elements likely taken from the anime, which implemented similar traits starting in the Advanced Generation series. The marking on the tip of a female Partner Eevee is heart-shaped. Before Pokémon Sword and Shield, this trait was unique and wasn`t found on other female Eevee. Partner Eevee has higher base stats and access to moves that normal Eevee do not. Partner Eevee is the only Pokémon capable of performing Bouncy Bubble, Buzzy Buzz, Sizzly Slide, Glitzy Glow, Baddy Bad, Sappy Seed, Freezy Frost, Sparkly Swirl, and the Partner Power, Veevee Volley. In Pokémon Sword and Shield, the unique pattern is present on all female Eevee as a true gender difference.
As Gigantamax Eevee, it has become larger and more fluffy. The fur collar becomes longer with several triangular furs pointing straight up. The right ear has three red clouds surrounding it like a circle. Due to the fur becoming fluffier and luxurious, any enemies caught in it will lose the will to fight due to being enamored by its presence. Due to Gigantamaxing, Eevee becomes even more playful and rambunctious, desiring to play with its opponent and often unintentionally crushing them with its size.
Gigantamax Eevee is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Cuddle.</description>

<description>Vaporeon is one of the evolutions of Eevee that is caused by radiation from a water stone. Upon evolving, it gains fins and gills that give it the ability to live underwater. It has small scales that are hard to see. Its finned tail is similar to a mermaid`s, so it is often mistaken for one. Vaporeon`s cells are similar in structure to water molecules, and this allows it to have a unique control over the water around it. This includes being able to transform itself into liquid as a form of camouflage (this being portrayed in the games as its ability to learn the attack Acid Armor), and detect rain through subtle vibrations in its fins. Its base scale color is aqua with darker aqua that makes a line along the spine from the tail to the neck where it forms into a base for its white frill. A darker-aqua patch on the head is similar in shape to a diving cap, and upon the head are three yellow fins, two resembling ears, and the middle one, a Dorsal fin. Its ability is `Water Absorb`, which allows it to gain HP when struck with a water type move.</description>

<description>Jolteon is one of the evolutions of Eevee that is caused by radiation from a thunder stone. Jolteon is covered with spiky, bright yellow fur, with white spiky fur surrounding its neck. Its fur sparks with electricity constantly; it can be soft to the touch or turn into sharp needles that can be fired when it is angered. Jolteon is able to gather negative ions from the atmosphere, using the resulting electricity to create lightning bolts of up to 10,000 volts. Its individual cells also create small electrical charges on their own, which combined with the static electricity caused by its body can result in powerful electric-type attacks. It`s very sensitive which causes it to constantly charge as it quickly changes moods. It can also make lightning and cause small thunderstorms. In the Pokémon video games, Jolteon can absorb electric attacks and turn them into HP (Health Point, or Health) with the ability `Volt Absorb`.</description>

<description>Flareon is one of the evolutions of Eevee that is caused by exposure to a Fire Stone. It has a red body and thick, yellow fur on its face, head, neck, and tail. Its ears are as long as the Jolteon`s. It stores thermal energy from the sun, causing its body temperature to skyrocket to more than a range of 1600 degrees Celsius, releasing its flames from an internal sack. Its ability is `Flash Fire` which negates fire-type moves against it and increases its attack by 1.5 times damage if hit by a damaging fire attack.</description>

<description>Espeon is an evolved cat-like form of Eevee that became available with the Japanese release of Pokémon Gold and Silver. The appearance of Espeon is said to resemble the Japanese mythological creature known as Nekomata which also displays the feline body with forked tail tip and solid colored eyes. An Espeon`s fur is used to sense air currents, allowing it to predict the weather, as well as the actions of its opponent in battle. Its forked tail quivers when this occurs. A red jewel rests on its head, and glows whenever Espeon uses its psychic abilities. Espeon are described as being very loyal to their trainers once they consider them worthy. They are also said to develop precognitive abilities in order to protect their trainers, Espeon become enabled to see into the future to identify potential threats. Eevee evolves into Espeon by having a high happiness level and leveling up during the day. A Sun Shard item can also be used in Pokémon XD, a Sun Ribbon in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue, Red, Explorers of Time, and Explorers of Darkness. Espeon`s name is derived from "ESP" and the suffix "-eon", as with every evolution of Eevee.</description>

<description>Umbreon is one of two Eevee evolutions that first featured in Pokémon Gold and Silver, the other being Espeon. It is called the "Moonlight" Pokémon. It has rabbit-like features displayed strongly in the shape of its head and eyes, a reference to the Japanese idea that you can see the head of a rabbit on the face of the moon. One of Umbreon`s most noticeable features is the yellow rings visible around its body. The Pokédex states that the rings will glow when Umbreon leaps to attack, becomes excited, or when there is a full moon. Umbreon are said to evolve as a result of love for their trainers and the moonlight; forcing one to walk during the day can also cause stress to it. They are described as preferring to lurk in darkness while waiting for their opponents to make the first move. If angered, they can secrete powerful poisonous sweat from their pores.</description>

<description>Heracross is a large, blue, winged bipedal beetle. It has a capsule-shaped thorax similar to Pinsir`s, a pair of yellow eyes and two clawed arms and feet. Growing from its head is a large T-shaped horn, which is flanked on either side by a smaller antenna. Heracross is a powerful but docile Pokémon. Its natural habitat is forests and its diet consists of tree sap, nectar and honey. Its strength is such that it can topple large trees if it so wished. Heracross`s main weapon is its large horn, of which it is particularly proud. However, it only uses it in the wild to deter its foes, not hurt them.
In the Pokémon anime, Ash catches a Heracross in the episode A Sappy Ending. The Heracross is powerful, but also is distracted by sap, to the point where it tries to feed off the nectar of Ash`s Bulbasaur`s flower bulb when Bulbasaur is in sight. It is currently at Professor Oak`s lab.</description>

<description>Gible is the 4th generation rare Dragon type. Gible once lived in the tropics, but moved into caves to live off geothermal heat. Gible lives in tunnels it constructs inside warm caves. It prefers heat similar to that of a tropical climate. It nests in small, horizontal holes in cave walls. It pounces to catch prey that stray too close. Gible is one of the few Dragon/Ground Pokémon, making it weak to Ice- and Dragon-type moves. It is mostly a physical, speed Pokémon.
Gible Learns 10 Moves by Leveling Up (Last one at Lv.37, Dragon Rush), 36 Moves by TM (4 Are HM), and has 10 Egg Moves.</description>

<description>Weavile, known as the Sharp Claw Pokémon, takes on the appearance of a black, bipedal, weasel-like warrior garbed in a red crown and a red collar. Weavile have three claws on each paw, instead of two like its pre-evolved form, Sneasel. A female Weavile has smaller ears than a male one. Weavile are known to travel and live in mating pairs and are very mischievous. They are also known to travel in larger groups as well of about four to five individuals, living in cold climates and hunting prey with impressive coordination. They convey messages to others by scratching odd symbols in ice or on the bark of trees. They made their first appearance in the 8th movie, Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. Sneasel evolves into Weavile when it levels up at night while holding the Razor Claw item.</description>

<description>Glaceon, known as the Fresh Snow Pokémon, is one of two evolutions of Eevee that is obtained from training it in a certain location, the other evolution being Leafeon. The location necessary to evolve Eevee into Glaceon is on route 217 in the Sinnoh region. There is an ice covered rock here, but it is also possible to level up anywhere in grass on route 217 to evolve. Being an ice-type, it prefers cold climates, and as a protective measure it freezes its fur completely. This freezing causes the hair to resemble "ice needles."
In the Anime, May`s Eevee evolved into a Glaceon prior to her reappearance in the episode 544 `Restaurant Seven Stars! Tag Battle for a Full Course!` and Bianca got a same Eevee and now evolved into Glaceon nicknamed Iceshocker.</description>

<description>Meowth is a very unique Pokémon as it has many of the characteristics of a human. It walks on two feet, talks and is as smart as any human. Meowth is currently a member of Team Rocket and he travels around with Jessie and James trying to capture Pikachu and other rare Pokémon for Giovanni.
Meowth generally finishes his sentences with "Nyaa (ニャー)" which is the equivalent of "meow" in English. This helps people remember that despite his ability to talk like a human, he still has cat character traits.
Meowth is also known for coming up with his many schemes to try to capture Pikachu. While Jessie and James always agree with Meowth and think his plans are brilliant, they are generally foiled by Ash and his friends.
Long Con to Access Raimon City Pokémon Center
Meowth schemed with Jessie, James and Doctor Zager to figure out a way for them to infiltrate the Raimon City Pokémon Center where high-leveled Pokémon are stored in a vault that is protected by a security machine scan system that would only open if Nurse Joy (Isshu) or Nurse Joy`s Audino were scanned. Meowth pretended to be no longer part of Team Rocket making up a story that his made an error while executing a certain operation and when headquarters hear of his mistake, they told him he was fired.
Ash, Iris and Cilan believed him and allowed Meowth to travel with him. Pikachu though didn`t trust Meowth even though Meowth proved on numerous occasion that it should be trusted. Meowth`s plan was put into action when they arrived at the Raimon City Pokémon Center and as soon as Nurse Joy`s Audino was scanned to open the door, Meowth turned on Pikachu and the other and captured all the Pokémon in the vault. The long con had been a success and Meowth met up with Jessie and James below the Pokémon Center. Unfortunately, they weren`t able to get away as Ash and his friends realized that Meowth had just been conning them and they were able to stop Team Rocket.</description>

<description>The Beginning
On the morning that Ash was to start his Pokémon journey, he woke up late and by the time he reached Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory, all of the beginner Pokémon were already taken. However, Professor Samual Oak did have one Pokémon left, a wild Pikachu. At first, Pikachu did not like Ash and would refuse to enter his PokéBall. He would often laugh at Ash`s failures and refused to listen to him. However, after Ash proved his loyalty to Pikachu by protecting him from a flock of Spearow, and thus began to earn Pikachu`s trust and respect. The two have since become best friends and Pikachu never leaves Ash`s side.
Since the day Team Rocket first encountered Pikachu, it has been their sole goal to capture it. Day after day, their plan to capture Pikachu has been thwarted mainly due to Pikachu`s amazingly powerful Thunderbolt that keeps on blasting them off.
On numerous occasions, Pikachu has made it evident that he is happy being a Pikachu and has no desire to evolve into a more powerful Raichu. It has proven time and time again that it is a powerful and worthy opponent to any Pokémon that dares to battle it.
Gym Battle against Burgh`s Leavanny
Pikachu was then sent out to battle Burgh`s Leavanny. Burgh`s Leavanny managed to tie up Pikachu with String Shot but unlike Ash`s Swadloon who was able to break free, Pikachu ended up getting hit with a couple of Leaf Storm attacks and a Hyper Beam before it rolled into another of Burgh`s Leavanny`s Leaf Storm attacks to break the string off its body so it could attack. Freed from the String Shot, Burgh`s Leavanny tried to tie it up again but Pikachu managed to avoid it with its speed and then knocked Burgh`s Leavanny out with a combination of Iron Tail and Electro Ball.
Gym Battle against Elesa
Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy and was then matched up with Pikachu. Pikachu made quick work of Elesa`s Emolga and knocked it out with one attack, its Iron Tail.
Elesa`s Tynamo was the last Pokémon that she used in her gym battle against Ash. It was matched up against Pikachu who had just defeated her Emonga. Pikachu had a hard time defending against the fast Tackle attack that Elesa`s Tynamo kept hitting it with but Pikachu used its Thunderbolt to create a large dust cloud leaving only a small corridor for Pikachu to focus on it and so Elesa`s Tynamo couldn`t maneuver out of the way. Pikachu one hit K.O`d Elesa`s Tynamo with a Iron Tail. The loss gave Ash the overall victory.
Battle against Alder`s Bouffalant
Ash challenged Alder to a battle and he accepted though he had been walking all night and was actually quite tired. Alder sent out his Buffron to battle Pikachu but just as the battle started, Alder fell asleep standing up and didn`t give any orders to his Buffron. Alder`s Bouffalant stood still as Pikachu began hitting it with attack after attack until it Alder`s Bouffalant finally got mad at Alder and charged at him and set him flying into a tree. After that, Alder`s Bouffalant no longer wished to battle and Alder conceded the battle.
Gym Battle against Skyla
In Skyla air battle simulation, Ash`s Tranquill was matched up against Skyla`s Unfezant and since her Pokémon was the highest evolved form, she determined that her Pokémon would be the winner in that match-up. In the actual gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was up against Skyla`s Unfezant which was the match-up just after Ash`s Tranquill had defeated Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla`s Unfezant proved to be stronger and faster than Ash`s Tranquill, so Ash recalled it and set out Pikachu. Pikachu had a definite advantage over Skyla`s Unfezant with its electric attacks and it quickly knocked it out with its Electro Ball attack.
Ash Just after Pikachu ended up knocking out Skyla`s Unfezant, Skyla`s Swanna was sent out to battle against it. Skyla had been watching her grandpa`s battle videos and noticed that he used the move Aqua Ring to defend against Electric attacks. She used that same defense against Pikachu which nullified its Electric attacks. It`s Iron Tail also couldn`t hit it so high in the air. Ash then noticed the rings in the air and Pikachu jumped up on them and managed to hit Skyla`s Swanna but not directly. Pikachu was now up in the air though and Skyla`s Swanna had the advantage there and it quickly knocked Pikachu out with a powerful Brave Bird attack.
Battle Against Trip`s Serperior at the Isshu League
Pikachu participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where it is was matched up against Trip`s Serperior. Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter its speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round.</description>

<description>While Wobbuffet is technically Jessie`s Pokémon, it has been around so long that it has become a main character, appearing in almost every episode of the series since it debut.
Wobbuffet was first seen walking around with Benny, his previous trainer. Jessie traded her Lickitung for Wobbuffet and it has been with her ever since that day.
Wobbuffet rarely battles but when he does, his Counter and Mirror Coat moves have proved to be very effective. Unfortunately, Jessie`s tactics aren`t always sufficient to master Wobbuffet`s superior defensive skills.
Wobbuffet also randomly comes out of his Pokeball, especially during the Team Rocket motto. He is also seen blasting off with Jessie regardless if he was actually part of the action.</description>

Its eyes are hidden behind two shaggy tufts of fur. It has a large mouth with a single fang, and two relatively small wings on either side of it. It lives in dark forests and caves. It explores its surroundings by releasing ultrasonic waves from its nostrils. It sleeps stuck on the walls of caves by its nostrils. It leaves heart marks on the places where it was stuck.
Woobat`s first appearance in the video games is in the two games Pokémon Black and White as a common Pokémon found in the wild. It eventually evolves into the Pokémon Swoobat by leveling up when its happiness is high. Happiness can be raised by fighting through many Pokémon battles. In the games, it was described as Black and White`s version of the Pokémon Zubat due to being of a similar species Woobat also appears in the Pokémon spin-off game Battle &amp; Get! Pokémon Typing DS where players type in the names of Pokémon that they see. In the anime, Jessie catches a Woobat while in a cave with James and Meowth. She uses it to battle against Ash and Iris. It manages to defeat Ash`s newly captured Pidove but is defeated by Oshawott`s Water Gun. Woobat has made other minor appearances in the anime. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, a Woobat is in the possession of the character White.
IGN described it as the baby of "a Tribble, a bat, and a pig". Game Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava stated "I kind of like the idea of having a romantic bat as a Pokémon... However, I`m not sold on its abilities". Jeremy Parish of Retronauts criticized the series` use of redundant new Pokémon, commenting that Woobat was the same as Zubat, referencing the uncanny similarities in name. IGN`s Jack DeVries questioned whether Woobat would act as a Zubat replacement. He later expressed that despite being unsure of Woobat`s quality, he wrote that "at least he`s not a Zubat". 1UP.com`s Kat Bailey wrote that Woobat was basically a Zubat with a pig`s snout. 1UP.com`s Michael Vreeland wrote that Woobat was "a lot more interesting" than Zubat. G4TV`s Nikole Zivalich, however wrote that Woobat was derivative and inferior to Zubat and that while fans will appreciate not having to run into so many Zubats, the "alternative isn`t much better". Carolyn Gudmundson of GamesRadar similarly described Woobat as the "new Zubat", noting that based on their looks, it and its evolution are two of their favourite Pokémon; however, they do note that they have some faults gameplay-wise.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Iris`s Axew was first seen appearing out of Iris`s large hairdo, much to the surprise of Ash and Pikachu. Ash helped rescue Axew from Team Rocket when they captured it just after Iris met Ash.
Axew is Iris`s main Pokémon and it doesn`t seem to like to travel in its monster ball. It seems to prefer traveling on Iris`s shoulders and in her hair.
Mastering Dragon Rage
Iris had been practicing Dragon Rage with her Kibago for quite a while and every time the attack was used it was unsuccessful and created a crater in the ground where the attack was used and injured everyone in the area. After being captured by Team Rocket along with Crimgan, Iris`s Axew managed to master Dragon Rage which was powerful enough to crash their flying transport mecha. In the battle encounter with Team Rocket that occurred after the crash, Iris`s Axew showed everyone that it had finally mastered the move by launching a successful attack at Team Rocket but they managed to escape before it hit them.
Don Battles Against Luke`s Golett
Iris`s Axew and Luke`s Golett were matched up in the semi-final round of the Don Battles in Raimon Town. Luke`s Golett dominated most of the battle and just as Iris`s Axew was about to be defeated, it learned the move Outrage. Outrage was able to do significant damage to Luke`s Golett and it knocked it out which eliminated Luke from the tournament.
Battle against Cynthia`s Garchomp / Learning Giga Impact
Iris asked to battle Cynthia`s Garchomp with her Kibago as she was working on becoming a Dragon Master. Even before it the started, the battled seemed like Cynthia`s Garchomp would win. Iris`s Axew could not do any damage to Cynthia`s Garchomp until it finally concentrated for a few moments and learned Giga Impact. While Giga Impact was able to do some damage to Cynthia`s Garchomp, it quickly overpowered Iris`s Axew until Cynthia decided to end the match before a finishing blow.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Ash first encountered Mijumaru at Professor Juniper laboratory as it was one of the Pokémon that Trip was to choose from. Ash called it cute when he first saw it which caused Mijumaru to blush a bit. After being shocked that it wasn`t chosen by Trip, it followed Ash and Pikachu as they started their journey in the Isshu region.
It rescued Pikachu and Iris`s Axew from Rocket Gang. Ash thanked it but quickly left it behind in the forest so that he could treat Pikachu. It continued following Ash until one day it met up again and tried to explain that it wanted to join Ash on his journey. Ash tried to capture it with one of his Poké balls but then realized it already had a Poké ball and that this Mijumaru must have been the same one that he met at Professor Juniper lab. He contacted Professor Juniper and she agreed to let him have the Mijumaru and transferred its Poké ball to him. By the time it had been transferred over, it had disappeared again.
Ash met up with Mijumaru once again when they were resting in the sands at Dan`s hotel. After protecting Ash from being scalded from a hot water geyser, Ash quickly recalled it into the Poké ball before it got scalded itself. Since then Ash`s Oshawott has had the tendency to come out of its Poké ball whenever it feels like despite what the current situation is.
Gym Battles against Lenora`s Watchog
During the first gym battle against Ash`s Oshawott, Lenora`s Watchog used Mean Look so Ash`s Oshawott couldn`t be switched out. Since Ash`s Oshawott wasn`t expecting to battle Lenora`s Watchog at that time, it was at a disadvantage and it was in a bad mood. After Ash`s Oshawott lost its shell during the battle, Lenora`s Watchog was able to use its Thunderbolt effectively to knock Ash`s Oshawott out of the match.
During the rematch battle against Lenora`s Watchog, Ash`s Oshawott had learned Aqua Jet during the time between the two battle and but its accuracy make it easy for Lenora`s Watchog to avoid it. Though through sheer luck, Ash`s Oshawott Aqua Jet managed to hit Lenora`s Watchog and both ended up getting knocked out at the same time as Lenora`s Watchog used Thunderbolt just before it got hit.
Three-on-Three Battle Against Trip`s Timburr
Ash`s Oshawott was paired up against Trip`s Timburr but the beginning of the battle didn`t go to well for Ash as Ash`s Oshawott had its eyes closed during Aqua Jet and completely missed hitting Trip`s Timburr. After a short break in the battle, the two finished up with their final attacks. Ash`s Oshawott`s Razor Shell proved to be stronger than Trip`s Timburr`s DynamicPunch and Ash`s Oshawott defeated Trip`s Timburr despite its initial problems with Aqua Jet`s accuracy.
Mastering Aqua Jet
While training in Don George`s pool for the battle against Lenora, Ash`s Oshawott learned Aqua Jet. It`s aim proved to be quite off but through sheer luck it was able to use Aqua Jet to knock out both Lenora`s Watchog and Stephan`s Blitzle. It wasn`t until Trip noticed by taking some pictures during his three-on-three battle with Ash that Ash`s Oshawott had its eyes closed during Aqua Jet. Ash vowed to help his Oshawott practice to keep its eyes open underwater so that its Aqua Jet`s targeting would be accurate.
While enroute to Raimon City, Ash, Iris and Cilan`s Pokémon all got poisoned and the only thing that could cure them was a waterweed plant found in a nearby lake. Ash`s Oshawott was training with Ash at the time and didn`t get poisoned and since it was a Water Pokémon, it was best suited for the job. Unfortunately Ash`s Oshawott still didn`t like to open its eyes underwater until it was forced to defend itself against a school of Tympole who were protecting their lake from trespassers. Ash`s Oshawott opened its eyes underwater to defend itself and it started to get comfortable doing so. Ash`s Oshawott was later forced to battle Palpitoad because it came out of the water to protect its lake. During the battle, Ash`s Oshawott managed to master its Aqua Jet as it was able to remember the battle against the Tympole school and how having its eyes opened underwater was quite effective and that proved to be the decisive factor in the battle as Palpitoad was knocked out and Ash caught it.
Battle against Bel`s Father`s Hihidaruma
Ash challenged Bianca`s Father to a Pokémon battle to allow Bianca to continue to travel. He agreed but changed the challenge to force Ash to return home to Pallet Town if he lost the battle. Ash`s Oshawott came out of its ball as it wanted to battle against Bianca`s Father`s Darmanitan and Ash thought that it would be okay because it had a type advantage being a water Pokémon. Even though Bianca`s Father`s Darmanitan only used Fire type moves throughout the battle, it proved to be too strong for Ash`s Oshawott. Ash`s Oshawott did manage to land an Aqua Jet. Bianca`s Father commented though that his Red Flash Hihidaruma gets more fired up the more resistance it faces and shortly after it knocked Ash`s Oshawott out. Despite loosing the battle, Bianca`s Father changed his mind because the battle with Ash and his Mijumaru made him remember the joy of traveling.
Battle Against Pod`s Baoppu
Initially, Ash was going to battle Chili`s Pansear with his Pikachu, but Ash`s Oshawott popped out and wanted to battle it instead. Ash agreed and despite the type disadvantage in this battle, Chili just got more fired up. Chili`s Pansear managed to cover its weakness with power and momentum and taking Cilan`s advice into account, it used Flame Charge to increase its speed to become useful when dodging Ash`s Oshawott moves. Chili`s Pansear managed to endure Ash`s Oshawott super effective moves just long enough for it to use its newly learned SolarBeam attack which Ash`s Oshawott was unable to dodge and it was knocked out. Chili`s Pansear won the battle despite the type disadvantage.
Battle Against Clay`s Krokorok
Clay`s Krokorok was the first Pokémon Clay used to battle against Ash during his gym battle. Clay`s Krokorok was paired up against Ash`s Oshawott as Pikachu initially wanted to battle it but Ash realized that an Electric type against a Ground type would be a bad idea.
At the beginning of the battle, Clay`s Krokorok had the upper hand as its Sandstorm managed to get sand in Ash`s Oshawott`s eyes and it also made it harder for Ash`s Oshawott to accurately attack. Clay`s Krokorok managed to hit Ash`s Oshawott with a Bite and a Stone Edge attack but it wasn`t enough to knock it out. Ash`s Oshawott used Water Gun to clear up the Sandstorm and then it began its counterattack. Clay`s Krokorok was repetitively hit with multiple attacks from Ash`s Oshawott including a super effective Aqua Jet and Razor Shell combo that ended up being too much for it and it was knocked out.
Battle Against Clay`s Palpitoad
Ash decided to keep his Oshawott out to battle against Clay`s Palpitoad and right away it became evident that Clay`s Palpitoad was the stronger Pokémon as its Hydro Pump ended up being more powerful than Ash`s Oshawott Water Gun. Clay`s Palpitoad followed up with a Sludge Bomb that knocked Ash`s Oshawott`s scallsword out of its hand and just as it was retrieving it, it got hit by Clay`s Palpitoad Rock Smash`s and was knocked out.
Ash`s Oshawott and Dawn`s Piplup Rivalry
Ash`s Oshawott and Dawn`s Piplup both fell in love with Meloetta and the two of them began a rivalry to win the affection of Meloetta. Ash`s Oshawott would often come out of its PokéBall when it could tell that Dawn`s Piplup was trying to take advantage of a situation. Even though the two of them often argued, they found a common ground and became friends after Meloetta left.</description>

<description>Cilan`s Pansage was first revealed in the Sanyo Gym when Ash was shown the three gym leaders Pokémon and he looked it up in his PokéDex. Yanappu is Cilan`s main Pokémon and is relied on quite often to help Cilan out with his various tasks.
Yanappu battled against Ash`s Oshawott during his gym battle. Cilan`s Pansage showed its speed by being able to dodge most of Mijumaru Water Gun attacks.
Battle Against Pod`s Baoppu
Chili wanted to see the results of Cilan`s studying and he challenged him to a battle. Chili thought that it would be an easy battle as they had the super effective type advantage but as the battle progressed Chili didn`t like the fact that Cilan`s Pansage kept avoiding all of Chili`s Pansear fire attacks and Chili told Cilan that running away all the time doesn`t make a battle. Cilan though told him that running away is a perfectly fine way to battle. Chili got more angry during the battle and after loosing he blamed his Baoppu for the loss as it missed its Fire Blast at the most crucial moment. Chili`s Pansear ran away in anger as it was mad it was getting blamed for the loss and Cilan then blamed Chili for the loss in the battle which only fueled Chili`s anger and he ran off as well.
Battle against Skyla
Skyla`s Unfezant was matched up against Cilan`s Pansage in Skyla`s air battle and she believed that her Unfezant would be victorious. In the actual gym battle, Skyla`s Swoobat was matched up against Cilan`s Pansage. It proved to be very fast in the air and easily dodged all of Cilan`s Pansage`s attacks. It only used two attacks against Cilan`s Pansage: a Air Cutter and a Gust attack before it knocked it out and gave Skyla the victory in the first round.
Tag Battle against Soran`s Warrgle and Riiku`s Mogurew
Cilan`s Pansage had a tag battle with Ash`s Unfezant against Soran`s Warrgle and Riiku`s Mogurew while Ash and his friends were on their way to Higaki City where the Isshu League was to be held. Soran`s Warrgle and Riiku`s Mogurew used special move combinations which proved to be effective in the tag battle against Ash and Cilan until they also decided to use their own combination of moves which ended up overpowering Soran`s Warrgle and Riiku`s Mogurew and they lost the tag battle.</description>
