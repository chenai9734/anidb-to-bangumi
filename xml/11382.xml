<description>"I finished this film in only two months after the completion of Playground. Inspired by optical illusions, like Escher`s paintings, I made the film using isometric drawings. my idea was to make a great film using only transformations of rectangular parallelepipeds. I applied the method of geometric animation, a technique used in Metropolis, in this film. Along with "cell" animation, I continue making films with the application of this method. Hopefully, I will eventually discover a third alternative method to use in my films."

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>cast-free</name>
<description>A cast-free show is one with no characters or spoken dialogue from any source. This does not include narration; a show that fits the previous requirements but has a narrator is still considered cast-free. Additionally, a show with only "characters" that are equivalent to background scenery should be considered cast-free; please ask before adding or removing the tag from shows that may fit this characteristic.</description>

<name>short movie</name>
<description>Typically used when an OVA only has one part and is less than the usual 20 to 25 minutes in length.
So instead of calling it a `short episode`, the `short movie` tag is more appropriate.</description>

<description>It may sometimes be useful to know about technical aspects of a show, such as information about its broadcasting or censorship. Such information can be found here.</description>
