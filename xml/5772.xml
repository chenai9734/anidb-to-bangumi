<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges.

Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

The player assumes control of one or several fictional characters (a party) who have joined forces in order to perform quests and overcome a great number of challenges and enemies, usually monsters inspired by fantasy, and, to a lesser extent, science fiction and classic mythology.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>proxy battles</name>
<description>In our terms, a proxy battle is a battle where humans use creatures/robots to do the fighting for them, either by commanding those creatures/robots or by simply evolving them/changing them into battle mode. Often the training aspect is also involved, or in some cases the proxies are nothing more than holographic representatives of some other variation of competition (like for example a card game). While many popular shounen anime fit under this category, it`s not limited to shounen anime.</description>

<name>Butterfree</name>
<gender>dimorphic</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Butterfree is a dual-type Bug/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Metapod starting at level 10. It is the final form of Caterpie. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Butterfree resembles a vaguely anthropomorphic butterfly with a purple body. Unlike true insects, it only has two body segments and four light blue legs. The upper pair of legs resembles small, three-fingered hands, while the lower pair resembles long, digit-less feet. Butterfree has two black antennae, a light blue snout with two fangs underneath, and large, red compound eyes. Its two pairs of wings are white with black venation. Two oval scales on a female Butterfree`s lower wings are black, but they are white on a male.
As Gigantamax Butterfree, its size increases to gigantic length with altered look. The wings and its pattern changes to light and dark green color with white. The antennae change to bright green and extends to the point where the tip bends, and three red clouds surround it. The eyes changes to bright glowing red. A fur-like circle is attached to both the wings and back of Butterfree. Several green scales can be seen floating around Butterfree, which are its most effective weapons, capable of releasing paralysis, poisoning, or sleep. The massive wings are powerful enough to lift a 10-ton truck through a simple flap. The wind it generates can scatter poisonous scales throughout the area, making it dangerous to be near it.
Butterfree`s wings are covered with poisonous powders that fall off continuously as it flies. It will defend Caterpie from bird Pokémon using this powder. This powder also repels water, enabling it to gather honey even in the rain. Butterfree will roam up to six miles (ten kilometers) from its nest in search of honey, which it carries with the hairs of its legs. Sometimes it has territorial disputes with Cutiefly over fields of flowers. It also consumes sap from trees pierced by Heracross, as seen in the anime. Butterfree is found in temperate forests and jungles, but it has also been observed flying near the ocean as part of its migratory breeding pattern.
Gigantamax Butterfree is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Befuddle.</description>

<description>Pidgeotto, known as the Bird Pokémon, is a bird-like Pokémon, is a larger and stronger form that Pidgey takes when it gains enough experience. In the main Pokémon game series, a Pidgeotto is only acquired when a Pidgey grows past experience level 18 and evolves into a Pidgeotto. A Pidgeotto is extremely territorial, generally claiming a large area with its nest built in the center. Full of vitality, it constantly patrols its territory, mercilessly attacking intruders. They fly about in circular patterns while hunting, and can spot the movements of their prey on the ground no matter how high they fly. The Pidgeotto attacks with its wickedly sharp talons and carries its prey, including Exeggcute and Magikarp, back to its nest from as far as 60 miles away - or more.
Pidgeotto was the second Pokémon Ash caught in the beginning of his career, eventually evolving into Pidgeot.</description>

<description>Pidgeot, known as the Bird Pokémon, is a bird-like Pokémon, whose original name in the English beta version of Pokémon Red and Blue was "Pidgeott", is the fully grown and developed form of the Pidgey species evolution line. In the main Pokémon game series, a Pidgeot is only acquired when a Pidgeotto grows past experience level 36 and is evolved into a Pidgeot. Pidgeot are large, powerful birds admired for their glossy plumage and their battling ability. With their powerful chest muscles at work, Pidgeot can flap their wings fast enough to whip up gusts of winds to rival tornadoes. Pidgeot are very aerodynamic, capable of soaring to an altitude of 3300 feet and reaching speeds of up to Mach 2. Like Pidgeotto, Pidgeot feed on Magikarp by swooping from the sky and snatching them out of the water with their talons. Pidgeot appear very similar to Pidgeotto, so much so that one has been easily mistaken for the other, even by official sources.
In the Pokémon anime, Ash`s Pidgeotto evolves into a Pidgeot near the end of the Kanto saga, and remained in Pallet Town to watch over a flock of Pidgey and Pidgeotto while Ash went off to the Orange Islands.</description>

<description>Spearow is a small, bird Pokémon with short wings and a small, stubby beak. It is noted for being frail, but it makes up for that with its "Mirror Move" ability. It eats insects in grassy areas by flushing them out with its wings, and plucking at them with its beak. Its wings aren`t good for long distance travel or high flying, but it is able to fly at high speeds by flapping its wings very rapidly. It is very territorial, constantly buzzing about and calling with a loud cry that can be heard from half a mile away. It serves to scare away predators and keep in touch with other Spearow, which usually is used to alert them of danger. The golden spearow has golden wings and a golden beak, it also has a lighter color of brown feathers.</description>

<description>Fearow is a bird Pokémon that evolves from Spearow at level 20. It has a large wingspan; elongated neck; and thin, long beak; all characteristics being a radical departure from its short-winged, stubby-beaked pre-evolved form Spearow. Fearow uses its great wings to catch air currents and effortlessly glide over large distances for as long as a day without having to land or rest. It flies high into the sky, and swoops down at its prey. By using a combination of its neck and beak, it has a large reach, allowing it to pluck bugs from the ground or easily pluck prey from soil or water as it swoops down. If it senses danger, it avoids it if possible.</description>

<gender>dimorphic</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Pikachu is an Electric-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Pichu when leveled up with high friendship and evolves into Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone. However, the starter Pikachu in Pokémon Yellow will refuse to evolve into Raichu unless it is traded and evolved on another save file.
In Alola, Pikachu will evolve into Alolan Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone.
It also has a Gigantamax form.
Pikachu is popularly known as the mascot of the Pokémon franchise and a major representative of Nintendo`s collective mascots.
It is also the game mascot and starter Pokémon of Pokémon Yellow and Pokémon: Let`s Go, Pikachu!. It has made numerous appearances on the boxes of spin-off titles.
Pikachu is also the starter Pokémon in Pokémon Rumble Blast and Pokémon Rumble World.
Pikachu is a short, chubby rodent Pokémon. It is covered in yellow fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back. It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch for electricity storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is a patch of brown fur. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs.
The anime has shown that wild Pikachu live in groups in forested areas. Pikachu communicate amongst themselves using squeaks and tail-shaking as friendly gestures. In the anime, Alolan Pikachu are known to greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Electricity can be used to receive and send messages with each other, as well as other Electric Pokémon species. It raises its tail to check its surroundings and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups grow, they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. Pikachu forages for Berries, which it roasts with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that Pikachu inhabits a location is patches of burnt grass. It has been observed eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment.
Pikachu charges itself while sleeping overnight, though stress and a lack of sleep can affect this. It is able to release electric discharges of varying intensity. Pikachu has been known to build up energy in its glands, which it will need to discharge to avoid complications. It is also able to release energy through its tail, which acts as a grounding rod, as well as recharging fellow Pikachu with electric shocks. Pikachu can also electrify itself to use its signature move Volt Tackle.
Pikachu has three alternate forms: one, the Cosplay Pikachu appeared exclusively in Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. It is always female, has a black heart-shaped spot at the end of its tail, and can be dressed in any of five outfits corresponding to the five Contest conditions. The second form is Pikachu in a cap, which debuted as an event-exclusive Pokémon in Generation VII. It is always male and has seven variants, each wearing one of Ash`s hats from the anime. In addition to these two forms, many other Pikachu variants have appeared in various media. The last, Partner Pikachu is the Pokémon the player starts with in Pokémon: Let`s Go, Pikachu!. This Pikachu can be either gender, has higher base stats, and has access to moves that normal Pikachu do not.
As Gigantamax Pikachu, it becomes larger and chubbier. Its tail becomes longer and stores all of the electricity it generates, causing it to glow a bright yellow and enabling it to become as powerful as a lightning strike. Its power is equal to that a power plant; however, it is difficult to use it in peoples` homes since Pikachu can only remain in its Gigantamax form for a short time.
Pikachu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Catastropika, while Pikachu in a cap has its own exclusive Z-Move, 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt. Partner Pikachu is the only Pokémon capable of using Zippy Zap, Floaty Fall, Splishy Splash, and the Partner Power, Pika Papow. Pikachu is the only Pokémon capable of using the Light Ball item. Gigantamax Pikachu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Volt Crash.</description>

<description>Sandshrew are a species of brick-skinned mouse-like Pokémon found in several regions throughout the Pokémon world. Despite its name, Sandshrew`s appearance borrows more from the armadillo or the pangolin than from the shrew; its primary means of defense when threatened is to instantly curl up its body into a ball, leaving only its tough skin exposed. When it is rolled up like this, Sandshrew has the potential to withstand many attacks, as well as being dropped from a great height (also similar to hedgehogs). Sandshrew`s natural environment is deep underground in arid, sandy locations with very little moisture, such as a desert. It chooses this habitat to keep its hide as dry and tough as possible, while the sand also provides it with good camouflage.
In keeping with its physical characteristics, Sandshrew has high Defense in the video games, but low Speed. From Ruby and Sapphire onwards, it has the ability Sand Veil, which increases its evasion during a sandstorm. Sandshrew also appears in the spin-off game Pokémon Snap.
A Sandshrew owned by A.J. is featured in the eighth anime episode, "The Path to the Pokémon League." It had many notable traits, such as the ability to withstand water and its knowledge of Fissure, which it used to dispatch Team Rocket.</description>

<description>Sandslash are a larger and stronger form that Sandshrew take when they gain enough experience to reach level 22. Generally they are a moderately large, bipedal hedgehog or pangolin-like creature with hard yellow skin, lengthy claws, and a back loaded with an assemblage of large brown spikes. These spikes are hardened sections of Sandslash`s hide that grow to form a natural self-defense when Sandslash curls into a ball. Each spike remains on Sandslash for one year, after which it falls off and a new spike grows in its place. Sandslash can be found in desert areas, particularly close to dry forests. Sandslash`s spikes serve a number of purposes to help cope with its environment, such as providing shade to protect it from the sun and heatstroke or using them offensively to harm both predators and prey. It uses its claws to climb trees, cut up food and dig, the latter being an activity that can cause them to break if done too quickly. It cannot run very quickly, but it is very quick with its claws.</description>

<description>Jigglypuff, known as the "Balloon" species of Pokémon, are characterized by putting their enemies to sleep by singing a lullaby. Before beginning to sing, they mesmerize the opponent with their soft, glowing eyes, and if they inflate themselves, they can sing for longer periods of time. They can easily adjust the wavelength of their voices to that of the brain waves of a sleeping being, allowing for their pleasing melody to put its audience to sleep. They sing without pausing to take a breath, so if the opponent is resistant to sleeping, they potentially run out of air.
In the Pokémon anime series, Jigglypuff is a recurring character who aspires to be a great singer after the inspiration of Ash Ketchum and company. Unfortunately for it, every potential audience falls asleep before the song finishes. Jigglypuff does not usually choose an appropriate time to sing and has been a hazard many times, causing Ash Ketchum and his companions to often find themselves running away from Jigglypuff. It keeps with it a black marker, its "microphone," and uses it to scribble on anyone who falls asleep while it`s performing.
Its desire to have someone listen to the entire song was finally satisfied when it encountered a Whismur, who was able to stay awake due to its Soundproof ability.
Also, Jigglypuff`s Japanese name, Purin, translates into "pudding".</description>

<description>Growlithe`s name is derived from the words growl, because it growls at its enemies, and lithe, which refers to its readily bent posture before it attacks. It is harder to catch in Pokemon because of one of its attacks that allows it to flee. Its name in the beta version was Flamie. This cute puppy Pokemon makes its home in active volcanoes, grassy plains, and scorched plains heated by geothermal energy. Growlithe is Naturally loyal and protective of its trainer. If trained correctly it will remain motionless until it is given an order by its Trainer, though if it is improperly trained, or mistreated it will bite without warning or unprovoked. In the wild Growlithe will bark fiercely at anything that dares to invade its territory. Don`t let its puppy like appearance fool you it will fearlessly stand up to opponents bigger and stronger than it. Growlithe also has a superb sense of smell. Once it smells anything, this Pokemon won`t forget the scent, no matter what. It can even use its sense of smell to determine the emotions of other living things.</description>

<description>Arcanine is the larger, stronger and faster evolution of Growlithe. Arcanine is obtained in the games by using a Fire Stone on a Growlithe. Its signature move is Extremespeed. Arcanine is a canine Pokémon that resembles the shisa but is orange with black zig-zagging stripes and muscular chest resembling a tiger, also including large, bushy hair and a mane similar to that of a lion. Originating in China, people have always admired its beauty especially while running. Arcanine`s species is classified, and is a Legendary as seen in the Pokédex.
In the anime episode "Pokémon Emergency!", an image of Arcanine appears on a stone tablet that also depicts the Legendary Pokémon Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres. Gary Oak has captured an Arcanine, which was used to battle Ash at the Silver Conference.</description>

<description>Machoke evolves from Machop at Level 28. An interesting fact about Machoke is when seen in its "shiny" version, it shares a striking resemblance to that of The Hulk, being green in color.
Machoke`s name is a portmanteau of macho, meaning tough, and choke. The Japanese name Goriky is a pun on the Japanese word for superhuman strength (剛力) or godlike strength. Its name was originally "Kong-Fuu" in beta English versions of Red and Blue, which is a reference to Kung fu. Its signature moves include submission, cross chop and dynamic punch.
Machoke, along with its evolved form Machamp, is nicknamed as one of the bodybuilders of the Pokémon world, due to its humanoid appearance, huge muscles and the fact that it wears black speedos, and the belt round its waist makes it look similar to a wrestler (which is most probably what the pokemon was based on). The belt is known as a "Power Save" belt, which keeps Machoke`s power under control and helps to regulate its motions. The explanations of the belt`s purpose vary, but is quoted that because it is so dangerous, no one has ever attempted to remove it.
Machoke has had relatively few anime appearances, most of which were in the Jouto region, most notably in "Machoke, Machoke Man!", in which Machoke was Chuck`s signature Pokemon, and shared a very close bond with its trainer, who sparred and even used submission on during training. Machoke also appear as employed heavy lifters and construction workers, and can also be seen in the beginning of the games Pokémon Saphire and Ruby where a group of Machoke are seen carrying furniture into the players home, which are replaced by Vigoroth in pokemon Emerald.
Despite being measured at 4`11" in the Pokedex, whenever Machoke appear in the anime, they are always around the same height, or taller than, an adult male.</description>

<description>Victreebel is a carnivorous Pokémon based on the pitcher plant. It lulls its prey with a sweet, honey-like scent, and also the vine on its head (which waves as if it were an animal) before digesting it with powerful stomach acids that can even dissolve bone. Normally, its prey are bugs, but it has been known to attack and consume small animals. Victreebel cannot be caught in the wild in any of the Pokémon video games; it must be evolved from Weepinbell with a Leaf Stone.
In the anime, James of Team Rocket had a Weepinbell which evolved into Victreebel in the episode "The Breeding Center Secret." As a running gag, it usually tried to eat him as soon as it emerged from its Poké Ball (this tradition of James`s Grass-type Pokémon hurting him was continued by Cacnea in the Advanced Generation series, and Carnivine in the Diamond and Pearl series). While most Pokèmon speak in a vocabulary consisting of its own name, Victreebel, like Lapras, communicates through loud, high-pitched shrieks.</description>

<description>Geodude has a rock for a head, no nose, and two long arms that start with a bulging muscle and end with rock hands resembling a human`s. Geodude most frequently are found in fields and on mountains. People step or trip on them from time to time, mistaking them for rocks. Its arms are so strong that it can use them to climb mountains. Rhyperior sometimes accidentally shoot Geodude from their cannon-like arms. Geodudes are one of the few Pokémon to have appeared in every Pokémon game.
In the video games, Geodude is commonly found inside caves and mountains, and sometimes appears when Rock Smash is used. Geodude are also found in the Nintendo 64 game Pokémon Snap, hanging from mountainsides by their arms. In the Super Smash Bros. Melee battlefield "Poké Floats", a Geodude is the last float the fighters ride on before returning to the Squirtle float.
Geodude is a recurring character in the Pokémon anime. It first appeared in the fifth episode, "Showdown in Pewter City," used by Gym Leader Brock to battle Ash. Brock became a travel companion of Ash and owned Geodude for the first five seasons. Navel Island Gym Leader Danny and Rustboro City Gym Leader Roxanne have also used Geodude. In the anime, Geodude is able to levitate above the ground.
Geodude`s name comes from the word "Geode" as in a rock with a sparkly inside, and "Dude," usually used to describe a certain kind of male person.</description>

<description>Graveler resembles a large boulder with four arms and two legs. It lives and feeds on rocky mountains. It will climb the slope of a mountain daily, snacking on small rocks along the way, and roll back down once it has reached the peak. Though it is not very fast when walking, a Graveler rolling down a mountain trail is a very dangerous thing to encounter. Carefree by nature, Graveler ignores most obstacles that may appear in its path, such as grass, trees, boulders or even hikers, since it can roll through or over them more often than not. It is not essentially harmed rolling down the slope, even if the odd jutting piece of its body gets broken off. Machop are known to use Graveler as training weights.</description>

<description>Golem is a megaton Pokémon made from living stone, and one of the heaviest of all Pokémon species. Golem inhabits rocky mountains and volcanoes, often disguising itself as an inanimate boulder. It will annually shed its skin like a reptile, with its new shell often being bigger than the one before. Its body is almost impenetrable, able to withstand dynamite blasts; it can even detonate its own body, launching itself great distances in order to travel from mountain to mountain. When earthquakes occur near where Golem live, they will tumble down mountains, rolling at an incredible speed.
In the video games, the only way to obtain Golem is to evolve a Graveler by trading it to another player.
Golem has made numerous appearances in the Pokémon anime. It first appeared in the episode "The Bridge Bike Gang," in which Chopper, the leader of a bicycle gang, uses one to battle Ash`s Charmander.
Golem`s name comes from the word "golem," which is a humanoid clay or stone statue associated with Jewish mysticism.</description>

<description>Ponyta is a Fire-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves into Rapidash starting at level 40.
In Galar, Ponyta has a Psychic-type regional form. It evolves into Galarian Rapidash starting at level 40.
Ponyta is an equine Pokémon with cream-colored fur. It has brown eyes and triangular ears with reddish interiors. Yellow and reddish-orange flames form its mane and tail. The mane forms a short crest on top of its head and a short strip down its back to its tail. Additional flames are present behind its elbows and knees. The fire appears about an hour after hatching. It has four long legs, each ending in a single, gray hoof. These hooves are said to be harder than diamonds.
Ponyta has extraordinary jumping abilities and is capable of leaping tall buildings in a single bound. However, a newborn Ponyta is a weak runner and is actually barely able to stand. It gradually strengthens its legs and becomes faster by chasing after its parents. In the anime, it is shown that Ponyta can control its flames so that its rider is not burned by them. Ponyta live in grasslands, on plains, or anywhere that it can run freely.
In the Galar region, Ponyta has adapted to forests by being exposed to the life energy from it. It has chalk-white fur; long, purple-and-blue, cloudy fur that is also on top of its dark-purple hooves; purple eyes with light-blue irises; and a purple-and-white horn on top of its forehead. Galarian Ponyta can absorb the life energy located in the atmosphere and store it in its mane, which will then become more colorful and potentially release a shining glow if there is a lot of energy to use. The small horn contains a healing power. Ponyta can heal any slight wounds with a few rubs from its horn. By looking it the eyes of a person, it can read the contents of the heart. Should Ponyta find any evil, it will promptly go back into hiding.</description>

In Galar, Rapidash has a Psychic/Fairy-type regional form. It evolves from Galarian Ponyta starting at level 40.
Rapidash is an equine Pokémon with cream-colored fur and a pointed horn on its forehead. It has small, red eyes and triangular ears with reddish interiors. Yellow and reddish-orange flames stream from the back of its head to form a long, flowing mane. A short version of the mane trails down its back to its equally fiery tail. Flames are also present on its fetlocks. It has slender legs, each with a single black hoof.
Rapidash is a very agile Pokémon. It runs at about 150 mph (240 km/h), chasing everything that moves in hopes of racing it. With incredible acceleration, it reaches its top speed in only ten steps. At full gallop, its hooves barely touch the ground. The faster Rapidash goes, the longer the swaying flames of its mane will become. At an all-out gallop, its blazing mane sparkles, a feature which is said to enhance its beautiful appearance. Rapidash lives in grasslands, but it can also be seen on mountains in Pokémon Snap.</description>

<description>Slowpoke is a dual-type Water/Psychic Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves into Slowbro starting at level 37 or Slowking when traded holding a King`s Rock.
In Galar, Slowpoke has a pure Psychic-type regional form, introduced in Pokémon Sword and Shield`s 1.1.0 patch. It will evolve into Galarian Slowbro using an item found on the Isle of Armor or Galarian Slowking using an item found in the Crown Tundra.
Slowpoke is a pink Pokémon that resembles a cross between a salamander and a hippopotamus. It has vacant eyes that never seem focused, curled ears, and a rounded, tan muzzle. It has four legs, each of which ends in a single white claw. Its long, tapering tail has a white tip. This tail drips a sweet, sappy substance that is attractive to many species of fish. Slowpoke uses the tail as a fishing lure. The tail often breaks off, but it will grow back. In Alola, its tail is often dried and used in home cooked stews.
Slowpoke has notoriously dim intellect, and often forgets what it was doing. It takes a long time to respond to outside stimuli. For example, it can take up to five seconds to process pain and can take an entire day to notice when its tail has been bitten. Slowpoke is commonly found at the water`s edge. In some places, it is believed that Slowpoke`s yawn causes rain. This Pokémon is worshiped in those areas.
In Galar, Slowpoke gains yellow markings on its forehead and tail.</description>

<description>Farfetch`d is a dual-type Normal/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
In Galar, Farfetch`d has a Fighting-type regional form. Galarian Farfetch`d evolves into Sirfetch`d after landing three critical hits in a single battle, regardless of if it faints.
Farfetch`d is an avian Pokémon that resembles a light brown duck with a white underbelly. It has a flat, yellow beak, brown eyes, a V-shaped black marking on its forehead similar to a unibrow, and a three-feather crest on top of its head. Its wings are as big as its body and appear to be prehensile enough to substitute for hands. It has yellow legs with webbed feet and a stubby tail.
Farfetch`d is always seen carrying a leek stalk or spring onion. It carries this sprig in its wings, but sometimes chooses to hold it in its beak or feet instead. Unable to live without its stick, Farfetch`d will defend the stalk with its life. Losing it can leave Farfetch`d defenseless. Known uses for the stick include use as a weapon, nesting material, and emergency food source. It is selective about which sticks it will use and has been known to fight over good ones. Farfetch`d is found in temperate grasslands.
Galarian Farfetch`d is a deeper shade of brown, with a more prominent black mark on its head. As the leeks in Galar are much larger than those elsewhere, it carries its leek over its wing in order to better manage its heavy weight. It is renowned for its courage in battle.
Farfetch`d and its evolution Sirfetch`d are the only Pokémon capable of using the Leek item.</description>

<description>Dodrio is a flightless bird Pokémon with long, powerful legs. Dodrio resembles an ostrich, and its movement is reminiscent of the roadrunner. Its name is a portmanteau of the words dodo, the extinct flightless bird, and trio, in reference to its three heads.
As the evolved form of the two-headed Doduo, Dodrio has three heads, the third head which is said to be formed by one of Doduo`s heads splitting during evolution. Each one of the heads constantly expresses a different emotion: joy, sadness, and anger. Having three heads allows Dodrio to collect more information from its surroundings, develop complex plans, and remain alert at all times by keeping watch in three different directions. On the other hand, a Dodrio`s three heads are commonly known to squabble amongst themselves, probably due to each one having a different attitude. Though Dodrio struggles to fly, it has three sets of hearts and lungs to match its heads, granting it extraordinary stamina while running at high speed. Like its pre-evolution Doduo, it inhabits dry, grassy plains.
In the video games, Dodrio are often used by Bird Keepers and Triathletes practicing in running. In Pokémon Ranger, a Dodrio is the partner of the Fall City Ranger Leader Joel. Dodrio also features in the Pokémon Stadium games as Dodrio Mode, which speeds up the games` GameBoy emulator, and in FireRed, LeafGreen, and Emerald in the mini-game Dodrio Berry-Picking.
In the Pokémon anime, Dodrio first appeared on the morning of the first episode, crowing in place of a rooster. Dario used one in the episode "The Flame Pokémon-athon," and Violet City Gym Leader Falkner battled Ash`s Pikachu with one. Gary Oak also evolved his Doduo into a Dodrio.</description>

<description>Gastly (Spirit in the Beta versions of the English language versions of Pokémon Red and Blue) is made of a very thin, gas-like substance, which grants it certain powers and weaknesses. Some say it is an other-dimensional lifeform, while others believe it is formed from toxic gas. It can sneak into any place if it so wishes thanks to the invasive properties of gas molecules. It can render itself nearly invisible and approach enemies undetected, and can envelop said enemies regardless of their size and induce sleepiness, slow poisoning through the skin, or even suffocation.
On the other hand, Gastly`s negligible weight and gaseous nature make it very easy for it to be blown off or even scattered to nothingness under a strong wind (although it is presumed the molecules can regroup later). A Gastly will not appear in windy weather if it can help it, but when it finds itself threatened by a strong wind, it clusters in groups under the eaves of houses to protect itself.</description>

<description>Onix is a subterranean creature that bores its way through the ground at a rate of 50 mph (80 km/h) in search of food. The tunnels it leaves behind as it burrows through the earth are used as pre-dug homes by other subterranean Pokémon such as Diglett and Geodude. Within Onyx`s member is a structure nigh identical to a magnet, which allows it to determine its heading, its depth underground, and other such information useful for a subterranean Pokémon to know. It acts quite like a compass. As Onix ages, it burrows deeper underground, and its rocky member becomes progressively harder, rounder, and smoother. Around the age of 100, the pressures exerted on its stone member become so high that it is compressed into a much harder, diamond-like composition, although it is closer to metal in nature.
In the anime, an Onix is owned by Brock as part of the many Pokemon owned by the training gym that Brock`s family runs. Brock had initially received the Onix from his father, who is a specialist in rock-type Pokemon. When Brock feels the need to travel with Ash Ketchum yet again, he entrusts the care of the Onix to one of his many younger brothers. This takes place in Pokémon Chronicles. It eventually evolves into a Steelix.</description>

It instead uses its stored electric to increase its rolling speed. The amount of electricity in an Electrode is relative to how powerful its explosions are. The stored energy also generates strong static electricity around Electrode`s body, sometimes paralyzing enemies on contact. If it is bored, it often amuses itself by exploding. Electrode has two beady eyes and an almost nonstop grin.</description>

<description>"Gold-" refers to the fact that it resembles a goldfish. The "-een" is most likely "queen," but it is possible that it is a simple feminine suffix (misspelling of "-ine"). The Japanese name plays on tosakin (土佐金), which is a kind of goldfish. In the original Beta version, it was known as Goldy. Goldeen evolves into Seaking at lvl33.It is considered to be one of the most beautiful Pokémon in the world. Its sharp horn can do serious damage, but it can`t fight on land.
Misty owns a Goldeen that is not really used for battles, but to look for things underwater.</description>

<description>Pinsir is a bug-type stag beetle Pokémon covered with a thick exoskeleton. Its large pincers are adorned with sharp spikes which serve to damage foes caught in the pincers and to prevent escape. If it fails to crush its foe, it will throw the foe powerfully against the ground or into another object with its pincers. Pinsir requires warm habitats to survive. It becomes immobilized in cold climates. It burrows itself into dirt using its pincers and sleeps in the burrow through the night.</description>

<description>Tauros is a bull known for its violent urges and rowdy, aggressive disposition in general, as supplied by a tremendous amount of natural stamina. Any given Tauros finds it impossible to keep up its spirits in life without near-constant rampaging. It always tries to find opponent Pokémon to battle outright to serve this purpose, but if it is alone, it will instead concentrate on charging at and knocking down thick trees to calm itself. By locking horns with other Tauros, it fights to assert dominance in a herd. The protector of the herd is usually noted by battle torn horns. As Tauros is based on a bull, it is a male-only Pokémon; its female equivalent is the more cowlike Miltank.
Tauros has a special habit that specifically affects its ability to battle, both in the wild and in trainer-directed Pokémon battles: It whips itself with its three long snapping tails. When it targets an enemy, it heightens its will to battle by whipping its own backside with its tails before charging at full speed.
In the anime, Ash Ketchum captures a herd of thirty Tauros in the Safari Zone (though the episode which features this was banned in America due to its flagrant gun use and politically incorrect humor). They usually remain in Professor Oak`s fields, Ash occasionally picks one up for various tournaments or important battles.</description>

<description>Magikarp is a commonly found Pokémon that can survive in rivers, lakes,and oceans. Despite its adaptability, the Pokédex states that the Magikarp species has grown weaker over time, and it is one of the least viable for battling in the series. It eventually evolves into another, far more powerful Pokémon, Gyarados.
Magikarp is commonly thought of as the weakest Pokémon. They are only able to learn three moves: Splash (does absolutely nothing), Tackle (a weak attack), and Flail (which does more damage as Magikarp is more damaged.)
In the anime, Magikarp has appeared several times, most notably as the subject of a running gag in which a salesman attempts to trick Team Rocket into buying Magikarp in various guises. (This man also appears in Pokémon Red, Blue, Yellow, FireRed, and LeafGreen.) Team Rocket later adopted a Magikarp-shaped submarine.
Magikarp also appear many times in the video games. They can be found in almost any pond, river, lake, or sea. Many trainers have them, along with other weak Water Pokémon like Goldeen or Horsea. In Pokémon Pearl, one trainer named "Ander," found outside Lake Valor, possesses a Magikarp whose move "Quake" replaces the normal Magikarp`s equally useless "Splash".</description>

<description>Eevee is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves into one of eight different Pokémon through various methods. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Eevee is the game mascot and starter Pokémon in Pokémon: Let`s Go, Eevee!, as well as for the main characters of Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness and Pokémon Conquest. It is also the rival`s starter Pokémon in Pokémon Yellow, although Professor Oak originally intended to give it to the player.
Eevee is a mammalian, quadruped Pokémon with primarily brown fur. The tip of its bushy tail and its large furry collar are cream-colored. It has short, slender legs with three small toes and a pink paw pad on each foot. Eevee has brown eyes, long pointed ears with dark brown interiors, and a small black nose. Eevee is rarely found in the wild and is mostly only found in cities and towns. However, Eevee is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure that is easily influenced by its environment. This allows it to adapt to a variety of habitats by evolving. Eevee is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Extreme Evoboost.
In Pokémon: Let`s Go, Eevee!, the player starts with a special Eevee known as a Partner Eevee. The Partner Eevee has purple eyes and a lighter shade of fur. These design elements likely taken from the anime, which implemented similar traits starting in the Advanced Generation series. The marking on the tip of a female Partner Eevee is heart-shaped. Before Pokémon Sword and Shield, this trait was unique and wasn`t found on other female Eevee. Partner Eevee has higher base stats and access to moves that normal Eevee do not. Partner Eevee is the only Pokémon capable of performing Bouncy Bubble, Buzzy Buzz, Sizzly Slide, Glitzy Glow, Baddy Bad, Sappy Seed, Freezy Frost, Sparkly Swirl, and the Partner Power, Veevee Volley. In Pokémon Sword and Shield, the unique pattern is present on all female Eevee as a true gender difference.
As Gigantamax Eevee, it has become larger and more fluffy. The fur collar becomes longer with several triangular furs pointing straight up. The right ear has three red clouds surrounding it like a circle. Due to the fur becoming fluffier and luxurious, any enemies caught in it will lose the will to fight due to being enamored by its presence. Due to Gigantamaxing, Eevee becomes even more playful and rambunctious, desiring to play with its opponent and often unintentionally crushing them with its size.

<description>Vaporeon is one of the evolutions of Eevee that is caused by radiation from a water stone. Upon evolving, it gains fins and gills that give it the ability to live underwater. It has small scales that are hard to see. Its finned tail is similar to a mermaid`s, so it is often mistaken for one. Vaporeon`s cells are similar in structure to water molecules, and this allows it to have a unique control over the water around it. This includes being able to transform itself into liquid as a form of camouflage (this being portrayed in the games as its ability to learn the attack Acid Armor), and detect rain through subtle vibrations in its fins. Its base scale color is aqua with darker aqua that makes a line along the spine from the tail to the neck where it forms into a base for its white frill. A darker-aqua patch on the head is similar in shape to a diving cap, and upon the head are three yellow fins, two resembling ears, and the middle one, a Dorsal fin. Its ability is `Water Absorb`, which allows it to gain HP when struck with a water type move.</description>

<description>Jolteon is one of the evolutions of Eevee that is caused by radiation from a thunder stone. Jolteon is covered with spiky, bright yellow fur, with white spiky fur surrounding its neck. Its fur sparks with electricity constantly; it can be soft to the touch or turn into sharp needles that can be fired when it is angered. Jolteon is able to gather negative ions from the atmosphere, using the resulting electricity to create lightning bolts of up to 10,000 volts. Its individual cells also create small electrical charges on their own, which combined with the static electricity caused by its body can result in powerful electric-type attacks. It`s very sensitive which causes it to constantly charge as it quickly changes moods. It can also make lightning and cause small thunderstorms. In the Pokémon video games, Jolteon can absorb electric attacks and turn them into HP (Health Point, or Health) with the ability `Volt Absorb`.</description>

Its ears are as long as the Jolteon`s. It stores thermal energy from the sun, causing its body temperature to skyrocket to more than a range of 1600 degrees Celsius, releasing its flames from an internal sack. Its ability is `Flash Fire` which negates fire-type moves against it and increases its attack by 1.5 times damage if hit by a damaging fire attack.</description>

<description>Snorlax is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Munchlax when leveled up with high friendship. It also has a Gigantamax form.
In the Generation I and II games and their remakes, wild Snorlax can be found sleeping in inconvenient locations throughout Kanto. In order to catch one, a Trainer must first awaken it with music from either a Poké Flute or Pokégear set to the Poké Flute channel. A sleeping Snorlax makes a return in Pokémon X and Y, in which it is blocking the player`s way on Route 7.
Snorlax is a huge, bipedal, dark blue-green Pokémon with a cream-colored face, belly, and feet. Its body is composed of mostly its belly, as its limbs are comparatively small. Its head is large with small, pointed ears and two pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw. It has round feet, which both have three claws and a circular brown paw pad, and short arms with five claws on each hand. Snorlax`s bulk makes it the heaviest Normal type.
Snorlax is often found in mountains and forests. It wakes up only to eat, requiring 900 lbs. (400 kg) of food per day before returning to its slumber. It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it to eat even moldy food without feeling any ill effects. It can even handle thorny plants or Muk`s poison. It can also eat while it is resting. Snorlax is docile enough to let children and small Pokémon bounce on its large stomach.
Snorlax can show awesome power when prompted. As Gigantamax Snorlax, seeds and small rocks that were tangled in its belly fur goes through immense growth and a tree spouts upon its belly. The tree has three red clouds surrounding it like a circle. It almost never moves; even when in battle it only slightly lifts its body and attacks by flailing with its arms and legs. However, its attacks are very powerful — Gigantamax Snorlax is considered to be the strongest Dynamax Pokémon to have been discovered.
It is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Pulverizing Pancake and G-Max Move G-Max Replenish.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Mewtwo, known as the "Genetic" species of Pokémon, is a Pokémon cloned from Mew that exists quietly in an undiscovered cave. It was created by scientists through genetic manipulation of Mew`s DNA involving repeated recombination, gene splicing, and other DNA experiments over many years. While its DNA is mostly similar to the original Mew DNA, Mewtwo is very different in both its body size and personality. Its creators did not imbue him with compassion, making it one of the most savage Pokémon, able to strike fear into its enemies with its cold, glowing eyes. Being made for battle, its combat abilities and psychic powers were developed to be of the highest level, and it always thinks of defeating its opponents. In order to always fight at full power, it remains motionless to conserve energy.
In the events of the Pokémon: The First Movie, Mewtwo awakens, destroys the laboratory where it is created and being kept, and works under Giovanni, who had originally ordered Mewtwo`s creation, until realizing it is just being used. After escaping, it tries to destroy the humans that `enslave` Pokémon and start a new world. During Pokémon: Mewtwo Returns, it seeks complete solitude and chooses to live without fighting. Giovanni tries to recapture Mewtwo, but it is ultimately saved by Ash. Mewtwo chooses not to confine himself to the world and roams the earth. In the "Mastermind of the Mirage Pokémon" a mirage copy of Mewtwo is seen furiously battling Ash and its friends.</description>

<description>Mew is a Psychic-type legendary Pokémon. It was first introduced as a secret Pokémon in the first generation. Nintendo`s specialists in Pokémon have spoken, in Nintendo`s Pokémon-related speech in 2007, that Mewtwo is more powerful than Mew, therefore being a clone (better from the original: Pokémon Red and Blue and Yellow). Mew appears as a pink feline-esque Pokémon with large feet, big blue eyes, and a very long tail. Its skin is covered with a layer of fine pink hair. By nature, Mew is known to be a playful and kind Pokémon. Its DNA is said to possess the genetic composition of all existing Pokémon species, thus allowing it to use all known Pokémon techniques. In the anime, it is also capable of further teleportation, summoning giant pink bubbles of psychic energy (which serve various purposes such as closing itself in for protection, act as a cushion, or simply for Mew`s amusement of bouncing on), and rendering itself invisible.
In the first generation video games, Mew is mentioned in journal entries found in the Pokémon Mansion on Cinnabar Island stating that it was discovered deep in the jungles of Guyana, South America on July 5 (the year was not specified) and named on July 10, and that it "gave birth" to Mewtwo on Feb. 6. Mew was available at Kiosks during special events held by Nintendo after the release of Red, Blue, and Yellow. However, a glitch exists in these Generation I games that allows the player to capture a level 7 Mew.
Mew plays a role in some of the Pokémon anime films. In Pokémon: The First Movie, Mewtwo was created from a fossilized Mew hair found in the Amazon. A single Mew travels to where Mewtwo is holding its tournament in order to convince it to stop. It also made a short appearance in Mewtwo Returns (a special episode involving the whole of Team Rocket (including Giovanni) and Mewtwo, as well as various other characters.) In Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew, the backdrop revolves around Mew`s mysterious history and how this extremely rare Pokémon came to be so powerful. Also, at the beginning of the movie, a Pokémon "family tree" is shown. The first Pokémon on it is Mew, and the last is Ho-oh. Since Mew contains the genetic composition that is found in every species of Pokémon, Mew has the ability to transform into any Pokémon like Ditto. However, in the anime, Mew does not need to see the Pokémon in order to transform into it.</description>

<description>Sentret is a very cautious Pokémon, it raises itself up onto its tail to get a better view of its surroundings. While standing on its tail, it can see a long way. If it spots an enemy, it will cry out loudly to warn its kind. It will also hit the ground with its tail. A Sentret will only sleep when another one is standing guard. The Sentret will wake the others at the first sign of danger. Because of this, if one is separated from its pack, then it will be unable to sleep due to fear.

<description>Furret live in colonies with tunnels much too small for normal Pokemon to traverse, yet it is a perfect fit for the slim build of Furret as it hides from the outside world at the surface by traversing through these tunnels like gophers. These tunnel colonies become very complex, especially if they are very deep, and can potentially stretch for miles. Occasionally, these colonies are found intertwined with Diglett colonies. The Furret evolves from Sentret at level 15.
Furret`s rudimentary paws and legs are deceptively nimble, making Furret a quick, unpredictable predator especially skillful at hunting Rattata, its main prey. Also, the fur of the Pokemon is thicker than it appears, and Furret can fluff up its fur to make itself look much stronger and larger than it actually is as an intimidation tactic towards potential foes.

When Ledyba become part of a swarm, they become much more active and can cluster next to each other for warmth in cold weather. A Ledyba communicates with others through an aromatic fluid excreted from the points where its legs meet its thorax. By subtly changing the fluid`s scent, the Ledyba can convey a number of different feelings. The fluid can also help to determine a Ledyba`s location as well as its current feelings.

<description>Chinchou has a small blue body and two antennae sprouting from its head, both of which have a yellow globe at the end. These antennae are said to have evolved from fins. A Chinchou`s eyes are yellow and their pupils have the shape of plus signs. When blinking or closing its eyes, only the vertical parts close, making the pupils look like minus signs. Its habitat is the dark depths of the ocean floor. In the absence of any other light, Chinchou sees its surroundings and communicates by shooting positive and negative charged electricity particles between the tips of its antennae, creating an electric current and thus light. This can be said to be a form of bioluminescence. The charges Chinchou shoots between its antennae can also be used offensively, to stun its opponents with a flash of light or shock them with electricity.</description>

<description>Lanturn uses the bright part of its body, which gradually evolved from a dorsal fin, to lure prey. Given the nickname "deep-sea star", the light it emits is so bright that it can illuminate the sea`s surface from a depth of over 3 miles. It uses this light to attract and blind prey, and then swallow the immobilized prey in a single gulp. The light is also useful for Lanturn to navigate through the deep, murky waters. The light from its antenna is produced by bacterial symbiosis. Bioluminescent bacteria in Lanturn`s antenna cause a chemical reaction with Lanturn`s bodily fluids to create the bright light.</description>

<description>Pichu, known as the "Tiny Mouse" species of Pokémon, are the pre-evolved version of Pikachu. They stand at 1`00" and weight 4.4 lbs. Their cheeks are pink, and they have small, plump bodies with short, jagged tails, and large ears. They are not skilled at storing electricity, so when amused or startled, they often discharge jolts of electricity strong enough to affect adult humans. This lack of control becomes more stable as they grow older. The electricity that they do manage to keep stored is limited by their small electrical pouches in their cheeks. When the air is dry or on stormy days, they charge much more easily, leaving the sound of crackling static electricity emanating from them. They play with each other by touching tails to set off sparks, which also acts as a test of courage. They run the risk of shorting each other out, and scaring themselves into a crying fit with the flash of sparks that emanates from them. In the anime, it is said that a Pichu cannot use electric attacks without hurting itself. This is a feature not prominently featured in the games.
Pichu first appeared in Pokémon Gold and Silver, and is one of many pre-evolutions introduced into the series. At one point, a Nintendo GameCube game called Pichu Bros: Party Panic was in development but never released, featuring Pichu as the main character. Instead, the game was integrated into Pokémon Channel as an important part of the story-line.</description>

Flaaffy usually likes to sit upright, although it can stand on two legs if necessary. Its wool quality changes as it matures so that it can generate a high amount of strong static electricity while still having a small amount of wool. Its bare, electric-resistant, parts of its hides enable it to prevent electrocution. As a result of storing too much, it develops patches even where wool won`t grow.</description>

<description>Azumarill is the evolved form of Marill. Azumarill resembles a blue, bipedal rabbit with a large, ellipsoid body, long blue ears with red insides, and a blue ball on the end of its thin, elastic black tail. The white bubble-like pattern on its lower stomach helps it to camouflage itself from potential predators when it is in the water.
Azumarill`s long ears act as sensors to identify sounds even in fast running rivers. Otherwise, when alone, Azumarill plays in water as a natural pastime, though it must roll up its elongated ears to prevent the sensitive sensory materials inside them from getting wet. The ball at the end of its tail can act as a sensor and guide it while under water. It can make thick, liquid balloons out of thin air with the saliva-water stored in its body. If it spots a drowning Pokémon in any body of water, it fashions such air balloons and jumps in to give the troubled Pokémon air balloons to help it breathe.
In the Pokémon anime, Paul owned an Azumarill which he used in a gym battle against Roark. Although it knew powerful Water attacks like Hydro Pump, it lost to Roark`s Geodude, which prompted Paul to give it to a Pokémon trainer passing by, being disappointed by its strength.</description>

The appearance of Espeon is said to resemble the Japanese mythological creature known as Nekomata which also displays the feline body with forked tail tip and solid colored eyes. An Espeon`s fur is used to sense air currents, allowing it to predict the weather, as well as the actions of its opponent in battle. Its forked tail quivers when this occurs. A red jewel rests on its head, and glows whenever Espeon uses its psychic abilities. Espeon are described as being very loyal to their trainers once they consider them worthy. They are also said to develop precognitive abilities in order to protect their trainers, Espeon become enabled to see into the future to identify potential threats. Eevee evolves into Espeon by having a high happiness level and leveling up during the day. A Sun Shard item can also be used in Pokémon XD, a Sun Ribbon in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue, Red, Explorers of Time, and Explorers of Darkness. Espeon`s name is derived from "ESP" and the suffix "-eon", as with every evolution of Eevee.</description>

<description>Umbreon is one of two Eevee evolutions that first featured in Pokémon Gold and Silver, the other being Espeon. It is called the "Moonlight" Pokémon. It has rabbit-like features displayed strongly in the shape of its head and eyes, a reference to the Japanese idea that you can see the head of a rabbit on the face of the moon. One of Umbreon`s most noticeable features is the yellow rings visible around its body. The Pokédex states that the rings will glow when Umbreon leaps to attack, becomes excited, or when there is a full moon. Umbreon are said to evolve as a result of love for their trainers and the moonlight; forcing one to walk during the day can also cause stress to it. They are described as preferring to lurk in darkness while waiting for their opponents to make the first move. If angered, they can secrete powerful poisonous sweat from their pores.</description>

<description>Murkrow is a small black crow with red eyes. The top of its head is styled as a witch`s hat and its tail bristles out like a broomstick. Murkrow is rather unpopular in the Pokémon world. Its dismal appearance and nocturnal nature have long caused it to be considered an omen of ill fortune to all who see it. If a Murkrow finds itself wounded, it fights back by leading its pursuer to dark mountain trails in an attempt to get him hopelessly lost in the darkness.
Murkrow is also attracted to bright, shiny objects, which it collects to stash in its nest. This, of course, leads to many arguments between Murkrow and Meowth, who both share a common love of stashing things - and taking from each other! It does not hesitate to steal such objects if necessary and has even been known to attempt to snatch rings off their owner`s fingers (and complete strangers too, for that matter). With the addition of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, it is revealed that some Murkrow are servants to its evolved form, Honchkrow, who spends all of its time preening and ordering the Murkrow around. Also with Diamond and Pearl`s release, Murkrow, like many other Pokémon, have gender differences. In this case, Males have a taller "hat" - technically, the crest that resembles a three-pointed witch hat - than females would. Murkrow can only be found wild in the Pokémon Diamond Version in Eterna Forest, while Misdreavus can only be found in Pokémon Pearl at the same location.</description>

<description>Steelix is a large serpentine Pokémon that has a steel body with several spikes and a large jaw. The male has two spikes on each side of its jaw while the female only has one spike on each side. It is said that an Onix evolves into Steelix when one lives to be 100 or more, then the pressures exercised on its stone body become so high that it is compressed into a composition harder than diamond. Steelix continues to burrow underground like it did as an Onix, but it reaches far greater depths, reaching records of up to 0.6 miles (900 metres) while heading for the Earth`s core.</description>

<description>Qwilfish is a porcupinefish-like fish that has a round body with many toxin-containing spikes and a teardrop-shaped tail. The spikes give it trouble swimming, but it also has defensive measures against predators. Qwilfish can swallow large quantities of water in very short notice, causing itself to inflate to a much larger size, which it uses to intimidate larger opponents. If the opponent isn`t scared, Qwilfish uses the pressure of the water it swallowed to shoot out its toxic spikes at, thus weakening, the opponent.</description>

<description>Heracross is a large, blue, winged bipedal beetle. It has a capsule-shaped thorax similar to Pinsir`s, a pair of yellow eyes and two clawed arms and feet. Growing from its head is a large T-shaped horn, which is flanked on either side by a smaller antenna. Heracross is a powerful but docile Pokémon. Its natural habitat is forests and its diet consists of tree sap, nectar and honey. Its strength is such that it can topple large trees if it so wished. Heracross`s main weapon is its large horn, of which it is particularly proud. However, it only uses it in the wild to deter its foes, not hurt them.
In the Pokémon anime, Ash catches a Heracross in the episode A Sappy Ending. The Heracross is powerful, but also is distracted by sap, to the point where it tries to feed off the nectar of Ash`s Bulbasaur`s flower bulb when Bulbasaur is in sight. It is currently at Professor Oak`s lab.</description>

<description>Teddiursa is a bear cub, resembling a teddy bear more than a real bear. Teddiursa have a crescent mark on their forehead, which grows (both in thickness and in circumference) as the Pokémon ages. Once the crescent fully closes into a circle, the Teddiursa is ready to evolve into an Ursaring. Teddiursa, although an omnivore, has a diet that almost exclusively consists of honey. It makes its own honey out of fruit and pollen from Beedrill. It lets the honey soak in its paws, making it often lick its paws.</description>

<description>Ursaring is a large (although arboreal) bear with a yellow ring on its stomach. Ursaring eats food obtained from digging deep underground as well as berries from trees. Ursaring can hibernate through an entire winter without any food. Ursaring`s sense of smell is among the most developed of all Pokémon; it can detect subtle differences in scents. For this reason, Ursaring is sometimes used by police in the Pokémon universe, both as a strong enforcer, and as an explosive-sniffing Pokémon. If criminals are hiding in trees, it can use its claws to cut down the tree.
Its Japanese name, "Ringuma", originates from "ring" (ringu) and "bear" (kuma). In the anime, Ursaring is caught by Paul, after it is angered by Turtwig.</description>

<description>Remoraid is a Remora-based suckerfish that scavenges for food and has a somewhat symbiotic relationship with Mantine. Remoraid will attach itself to the underbelly of Mantine with its dorsal fin, eating scraps of food that Mantine drops as well as the parasites on them that causes them to itch. In return, the Mantine helps defend the Remoraid from enemies. When not scavenging for food, Remoraid will strike down its own prey with precise accuracy using fast streams of airborne water, which Remoraid shoots from its mouth using abdominal muscles. Remoraid can move faster through the water by blasting water from its mouth in the opposite direction of where it intends to move.</description>

Also, like octopuses, Octillery can move about by squirting pressurized water from its mouth. Octillery is a carnivore; they catch fish with their tentacles, and kill (and afterwards eat) it by smashing the rocky protrusions on its head into its opponent`s skull. Octillery is a nesting creature, in that it sleeps in burrows it prepares; however, its nests are temporary structures only, and it rarely uses the same nest two nights in a row.</description>

In the anime, Mantine protects Remoraid`s offspring, while the parent Remoraid help the Mantine in tough decisions. Mantine swims in open sea, participating in schools. Its large and well-developed wings enable it to briefly leap over the sea`s surface if it builds up enough speed, in a manner similar to some real aquatic species. Mantine is a filter feeder, like whales; its diet consists of most things that happen to enter its mouth while swimming.</description>

Skarmory raises its offspring in bramble bushes, the thorny environment causing the offspring`s bodies to become more resistant. Skarmory`s wings become battered from repeated battles, so it grows the feathers back to the original state once a year. Feathers from Skarmory have been used by people of the past as knives and swords. It is based on the Stymphalian birds of Greek mythology.</description>

<description>Stantler is a Pokémon with large, curved antlers. These antlers change the flow of the air, causing the space around them to act as a distorted reality, and leaving other beings around the Stantler confused and lost in their senses. This allows it to create hallucinations to aid it in battle or allow it to escape. The antlers are considered art in the Pokémon world, causing the Stantler to almost be hunted to extinction as the trading market of the antlers reached very high prices. The orbs on fallen antlers is often grounded up to a powder that helps people sleep. Stantler`s name is derived from stag, meaning a male deer, and antler, referring to the horn-like growths on its head.</description>

<description>Smeargle is the painter of the Pokémon world, best known for its unique "Sketch" attack. It has a long tail that ends in a tuft of fur similar to a paintbrush. The tuft is continuously soaked by a special fluid secreted from the tip of the tail. The color of the fluid is predetermined for each Smeargle. The fluid is used to mark the boundaries of its territory and print its footprints on the backs of its fellows once they reach maturity. Over 5,000 distinctive marks left by the species have been found in the Pokémon world.
Smeargle has its "Sketch" technique, which is unique to Smeargle. When used, it will replace itself permanently with the last attack technique used by an opponent Pokémon against Smeargle. It learns Sketch every ten levels. There are a few attacks Sketch cannot copy, (Such as Chatots main attack Chatter) but it can learn nearly every attack in the game.</description>

<description>Lugia is a legendary Pokémon that first appears in Pokémon Gold and Silver, appearing on the boxart for Silver. Lugia, thought to be the guardian of the sea, resides deep in the ocean floor. It spends most of its time at the bottom of the sea due to its tremendous power, which includes being able to topple houses just by flapping its large, powerful wings and the ability to start storms that can last for over forty days. It is usually seen near the beginning of storms, and it often uses its wings to calm them.
It plays the role of a general legendary Pokémon in some games, where it waits in a far-off location, ready to battle. Lugia is one of the main characters of Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness. The storyline of the game depicts a "Shadow" Lugia terrorizing the locals and wreaking havoc. It is the only Shadow Pokémon whose physical appearance is different from its regular state. Shadow Lugia is said to be struggling, asking for help to free it from doing Cipher`s work in which "its deeper closed heart refuses to do". The player has to catch and Purify it for it to return to its original state.
In Pokémon: The Movie 2000, Lugia comes from the sea when the three Legendary Birds Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres are roused by a Pokémon collector who tries to catch the trio. Lugia then battles the raging Birds and, with the help of Ash and Team Rocket, manages to calm them and restore peace to nature. Lugia makes a second appearance in the Pokémon TV series when the protagonist, Ash, travels to the Whirl Islands where he meets his friend Richie to help stop a Team Rocket scientist from separating a young Lugia named "Silver" from her parent.</description>

<description>Ho-Oh is a legendary Pokémon that first appears in Pokémon Gold and Silver, appearing on Gold`s boxart. Long ago in Ecruteak City, there were two towers, the Brass Tower and Tin Tower being the roost of Lugia and Ho-Oh, respectively. When the Brass Tower burned down, both Pokémon fled, never to be seen again. Three Pokémon became trapped in the flames of the Brass Tower and perished. Ho-Oh returned to the Burned Tower and resurrected the three Pokémon, who were renamed Raikou, Entei, and Suicune. It has an unknown gender. On Gold, it is Lv40 when caught while it is Lv70 when caught in Silver. It is better to have the lower version as the move tutor does not exist in Gold/Silver.
It is called the Rainbow Pokémon due to its various associations with rainbows. Its feathers constantly change through the rainbow`s spectrum of colors as light hits them from different angles. These leave a rainbow trail as it flies continuously through the world`s skies, though it is said to live at the foot of a rainbow. It is said to appear before pure-hearted trainers as the representative of the bonds between humans and Pokémon, and bring happiness to all that see it. This is expanded upon in the anime, where it is said to appear before a hero. Ash Ketchum sees Ho-Oh various times throughout his journey, the first time being before Gold and Silver were even announced. It remained a mystery until it was revealed in Pokémon Gold.</description>

<description>Mightyena is the larger and stronger evolved form of Poochyena. It is a carnivore with characteristics of hyenas and wolves, and a monochrome appearance. Mightyena inhabit wide grasslands in the Pokemon world. They live and hunt in packs, and never defy the orders of their leader, the alpha male of the pack; thanks to the leader`s experience in battle tactics, the pack defeats foes with perfectly coordinated teamwork. This unquestioning loyalty transfers over to when Mightyena are owned by Pokemon trainers, but the Mightyena will only obey the orders of a trainer it recognizes as possessing superior skill.
Mightyena are naturally quick to attack; they chase down their prey and nip until the target can no longer run. In the event that an individual Mightyena encounters a threatening foe, it gives obvious signals when it is preparing to attack; It starts to growl deeply and then flattens its body before biting savagely.</description>

<description>Zigzagoon is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation III.
It evolves into Linoone starting at level 20.
In Galar, Zigzagoon has a Dark/Normal-type regional form. It evolves into Galarian Linoone starting at level 20, which evolves into Obstagoon when leveled up at night starting at level 35.
Zigzagoon is a raccoon-like, quadruped Pokémon with bristly, zigzag-patterned fur. It has stripes formed by alternating layers of cream and brown fur. It has a brown head with spiky ears and a black nose. A black, mask pattern surrounds its brown eyes. The upper half of its mouth is jagged, and when it is open, there are two pointed teeth in its lower jaw. Its feet have three claws and pink paw pads. Its forefeet are cream-colored, but the hind feet are brown. Its brush tail is spiky and bristly.
In Galar, the oldest and original form of Zigzagoon have a more black and white patterned-fur. The red eyes are surrounded by a black spiked mask. The black feet contains three sharp white claws. It has a long pink tongue that is constantly standing outside of mouth with two lower teeth in between.
Zigzagoon is abundantly curious, as it wanders restlessly back and forth while rubbing its nose to the ground in search of something. It rubs its bristly back hair against trees to mark its territory, and plays dead to fool opponents in battle. Zigzagoon is found commonly in grassy fields. The Zigzagoon in Galar are known to be constantly on the move and never settling down. It is believed that the zigzag movements of the Zigzagoon from other regions originated from its Galar relatives. They enjoy battling to the point they often attempt to prove others into fighting it. While this succeeded with other Pokémon, humans instead mistaken it wanting affection, much to the Zigzagoon`s frustrations.</description>

It is a mysterious entity in the Pokémon world said to arrive by the chilly winds of Winter, and it is said to be a fearsome guardian of the deep forests it holds sway over from its homes on the tops of toweringly tall trees in dark forests. Its hand fans, which are larger on males than on females, are capable of whipping 100-mph gusts of wind, and it possesses a degree of Extra-sensory perception, able to read its foe`s mind and take preemptive actions most other Pokemon would be unable to do in time.

It migrates to other lands in search of warmth, flying over 180 miles a day on some occasions. It will courageously stand their ground against foes, taking on Pokémon like Skarmory with an equal footing. This gutsy Pokémon will remain defiant even after a loss. This however is in stark contrast to when it becomes hungry; it cries loudly. As a result of its relative youth, it sometimes becomes lonely and cries at night. It feeds on Wurmple that live in forests.
In the Pokémon anime, main trainer Ash Ketchum caught one and used it throughout the third-generation story arc, during which it evolved into a Swellow.</description>

It lives as a migratory bird of prey; it constantly flies towards warmer climates in a migratory fashion, and the moment it spots its prey, Swellow dives down at a steep angle and snatches the hapless victim tightly with its talons. It never misses its targets in this respect. Swellow is quite fastidious with its own body, especially its wings. When it is not cleaning its wings and tail feathers regularly, two Swellow are gathered together and unhesitantly take it upon themselves to clean each other`s wings. A Swellow`s tail feathers indicate that the individual is healthy if the feathers are standing at attention. Though it`s name suggests it`s based on a swallow, Swellow has many characteristics of a falcon
In the Pokemon anime, main trainer Ash Ketchum owned a Swellow, and he used it prominently throughout his journey in Hoenn.</description>

When Pelipper spots its prey, it dips its large beak into the water and scoops it up. It then proceeds to swallow it whole. Pelipper also carries the eggs of its Wingull offspring inside its beak before and after they hatch. This provides the offspring with protection and, after they hatch, nourishment from the hunted food.</description>

Gardevoir has psychic powers including telekinesis and telepathy, and it also has the ability of precognition, enabling it to see into the future to detect incoming dangers. It moves by levitating itself, and can ignore gravity. Its powers are strong enough to the point where Gardevoir can disrupt the space-time continuum. By doing so, it can create a miniature black hole. Gardevoir has an unparalleled sense of concern for its Pokémon trainer, such that it will even give its own life for its trainer. The psychic powers that Gardevoir wields are at its height when it is protecting its trainer from a threat. In Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire and Pokémon Emerald, Wally uses a Gardevoir in the final battle in Victory Road.
Gardevoir also appears as a major character in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team.</description>

<description>Surskit is a bug-like species of Pokémon based on the water strider insect. It was introduced in the third generation of Pokémon media in the fictional Hoenn region. Surskit frequents lakes and ponds, and it has the ability to walk, or at least glide, on the water`s surface thanks to an oily substance secreted from the tips of its feet which modifies the water`s surface tension, thus allowing the water to support its weight. Surskit`s diet consists of the microscopic organisms that are found at the base of a lake ecosystem`s food chain. Surskit can also secrete a thick, sweet syrup resembling honey from the tip of its head. This sap is said to appeal to some species of Pokémon such as Heracross. Surskit usually secretes the syrup when it finds itself in danger. The exact reasoning behind this is unclear, but it may aim at attracting Pokémon which will drive the danger away to lick the syrup off Surskit`s head.</description>

<description>Breloom is the larger and more developed evolved form that a Shroomish can metamorph into. This diurnal herbivore that lives in fields and forests with leaves for Breloom to feed on. Its favorite climate conditions are sunlight-induced warmth and humidity, which is when Breloom is at its most active. Breloom`s body is configured for battling opponents in a competitive boxing fashion. Its stretchable arms are capable of extremely quick, rapid-fire punches that are virtually invisible, putting professional human boxers to shame (compare with Hitmonchan).
Spores are located within Breloom`s toadstool cap, and Breloom sprays and scatters these spores out of the red holes on its cap as its tool to debilitate and poison opponents. Also toxically sporous are the seeds on Breloom`s tail, which sometimes drop off and are grown back. These seeds let loose their sporous contents when Breloom thwacks an opponent with its tail, making the foe even more at risk of succumbing to poisoning. These seeds are horrid things to consume; a mere bite out of one of these seeds that may be lying around on the forest floor will cause the consumer`s stomach to rumble.
Breloom is notable as one of two final-form Pokemon to receive the attack Spore, a sleep-inducing move with an accuracy of 100.</description>

<description>Slaking is the evolved form of Vigoroth. Compared to its earlier, pre-evolved forms, the Slaking species features an anatomy much closer to that of a gorilla. Though extremely lazy, a Slaking`s body contains a great amount of pent-up energy, and if it must battle an opponent it can potentially exert devastating power. In fields where these Pokémon have been, large bare patches appear in the grass. This is from were it reaches out and pulls up and eats all of the grass in its vicinity. When it has all been eaten, it reluctantly moves to another spot.</description>

<description>Hariyama is the larger and stronger evolved form of the Makuhita species. Hariyama appears like a sumo wrestler; its hands are large and orange, and it wears blue trousers with a yellow tare - one of kendo bogu. Hariyama trains by stomping on the ground to build power, and it gains enough power so that its arm thrusts can snap telephone poles in two and send ten-ton trucks flying. Although it appears fat, its bulk is made up almost entirely of muscle. If Hariyama were to tighten these muscles, it would be as hard as a rock. It has been known to challenge people to contests of strength without any hesitation. It has even been observed to stand on train tracks and stop trains in their tracks using forearm thrusts as a display of its power.</description>

<description>Nosepass is a Pokemon species found in the Hoenn region. Nosepass appears as a rocky-but-animate figurine vaguely in the shape of an Easter Island statue. It lives in caves and comes across as immobile because it is often found standing still in these environments. However, Nosepass displays behavior commonly associated with predatorial animals in the wild as well, hunting and feeding on prey that might be foolish enough to approach it. Its full body emits a powerful force of magnetism which it uses to pull its prey towards it like a tractor beam before feeding. This sense of magnetism is naturally bolstered in cold seasons.
The nose of Nosepass is undoubtedly its most notable feature. It is the focal point of Nosepass` magnetic nature, and this works to make Nosepass something of a living compass. When seen standing idly, it is consistently facing the North Pole as directed by its magnetic nose. Travelers who encounter this Pokemon can therefore actually use the placement of a Nosepass to check the direction of north and get their bearings. However, close observation has revealed that the Pokemon is affected by polar drift; With each passing year, Nosepass` direction shifts slightly at a rate of 3/8 of an inch each year. Since all Nosepass have noses of the same magnetism, if two of these Pokemon meet, they cannot turn their faces towards each other when they are close because their magnetic noses repel one another.
In the fourth generation of Pokemon media, if a Nosepass is brought to the Sinnoh region and it gains a level of experience while inside Mt. Coronet, it will evolve into Probopass.</description>

<description>Sableye lives in deep underground caves, where it leads a quiet life. It is a lithovore, meaning that its diet consists of rocks and minerals, which it uncovers from the ground using its sharp claws. When its body becomes saturated with substances derived from the rocks it eats, those substances crystallize and rise to the surface of its body, giving it a gem-studded appearance. Despite its hermetic lifestyle, Sableye is a cause of fear for many thanks to its eyes, which glitter eerily in the darkness of the caves it inhabits. In the Pokémon world, it is thought that a Sableye can steal a person`s spirit when its eyes shine that way. There is no attack type that is super effective on it, making it the first Pokémon without a weakness and the only such Pokémon until Spiritomb arrived in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.</description>

<description>Mawile appears to be a small, timid creature, but it is a deceptive Pokémon. It lures opponents into a false sense of security with its docile face and its harmless gestures. After doing so, it attacks with a set of flexible steel horns that can easily chew through iron. These horns act as a large set of jaws that bite foes, clamping them with the thick steel and puncturing them with the sharp "teeth". Not only can it bite opponents, but it can grab and throw them very long distances. Its design was based on a japanese legend about a woman with a mouth on the back of her head called a Futakuchi-onna. Its footprint is the only one to change through generations.</description>

<description>Aron has a body of steel. Aron feeds on iron ore it digs from mountains, and uses the nutrients to sustain its steel body. It usually lives in colonies very deep below the mountain, usually about a mile down. If iron ore becomes unavailable, the colony moves to another place to search for solid iron objects. This even includes steel bridges and rails, something which occasionally causes problems for humans. Because of this, Aron colonies are largely considered a pest to society. Manufacturers, however, can consider Aron a blessing. When Aron evolves, it sheds its old iron casing. This iron is very tough, and is used by humans to make iron products.</description>

<description>Wailord is a gigantic, oceanic mammal with the largest known size of all Pokémon. Living in the vast oceans of the Pokémon world, Wailord swims languorously in pods of about four members or more, often at the surface so it can breathe through its upper nostrils. With huge mouths these Pokémon can eat massive amounts of undersea food, such as krill, in a single gulp. When chasing somewhat larger prey, Wailord herd them by leaping out of the water and making humongous splashes in what is often described as a breathtaking display. If a Wailord inhales to the maximum capacity of its gigantic lungs, it is able to dive close to 10,000 feet below the surface. Optionally by puffing itself up, it can float high on the ocean surface or beach on a shoreline if it wishes.</description>

Lunatone was first discovered forty years ago in Meteor Falls, a cave in Hoenn, its only known habitat. Meteor Falls, as its name suggests, is full of meteorites and the craters left by them as they impacted the planet`s surface, suggesting that Lunatone (and Solrock) as partners, have their origins in outer space. Lunatone is greatly connected to the moon, and its vitality ebbs and flows depending on the lunar cycle. Lunatone`s power and activity is greatest during the full moon, and weakest during the day and when the moon is new. Anyone who looks at its glowing red eyes becomes transfixed with fear.</description>

<description>Castform is a small, rather unique Pokémon that resembles a cloud. It might be used like a satellite dish to sense upcoming weather changes.
It is distinct from other Pokémon in that its water-like cellular structure is affected by the weather, to the extent that its type and appearance change in extreme conditions. In intense sunlight, Castform becomes a Fire-type Pokémon that resembles an orange, stylized sun sitting atop a white cloud; in the rain, it becomes a Water-type and looks like a water drop sitting on a gray cloud; and in hail, it turns purple and is encased in a green, tornado-shaped cloud. In all other weather conditions, Castform retains its original typing and appearance. Castform`s mood is also influenced by the weather.
Like Porygon and Mewtwo, Castform is one of few human-made "artificial" Pokémon. It was created by the researchers of the Weather Institute in the Hoenn region as an experiment in weather forecast and manipulation. Its man-made nature is reflected in its uniform stats, all of which have a really average value.
It is the only Pokémon with the Forecast ability and one of two that learns the move Weather Ball (the other Pokémon capable of learning Weather Ball is Roserade via Move Tutor in Pastoria City). Both are influenced by the weather, regardless of how it`s set up (Castform does not personally need to change the weather for it to be affected).
Castform can naturally learn three weather moves which changes the typing of Castform and Weather Ball: Sunny Day (Fire), Rain Dance (Water), and Hail (Ice). It will become the type of the move, (having the same weaknesses and resistances), and Weather Ball will do that type of damage. It can also learn, by using a TM, Sandstorm. While Castform will not transform into a Rock-type during a Sandstorm, Weather Ball will do Rock-type damage. In Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, if Shadow Sky is used, Castform doesn`t change, but its Weather Ball damage is identical to Shadow Pokémon moves having no weakness or resistance. In all extreme weather, Weather Ball`s power is doubled.
Weather Ball also becomes even more powerful in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl because of the new attack changes. It is now a Special move regardless of its typing, so it depends on the Special Attack rating rather than the Attack rating (which was originally used for Normal- and Rock-type moves).</description>

<description>Snorunt live in icy dark caves and enjoys crying out to hear its own echo. Its diet consists solely of snow and ice. Old folklore claims that a house visited by Snorunt is sure to prosper for many generations to come. It generally moves in groups of five Snorunt, and they hide away during the hot seasons of Summer and Spring. Being an Ice-type, Snorunt can withstand temperatures of up to negative 150 degrees. Also, it has the peculiar ability to make Winter come early. A Snorunt typically evolves into a Glalie at level 42, but if a Snorunt is female and a player uses a Dawn Stone on it, it will evolve into a Froslass.
In the Pokémon anime, Snorunt is Ash Ketchum`s fifth Pokémon from the Hoenn region. It has a powerful Ice Beam, though this is hindered by Snorunt`s bad aim. Because of this, Ash constantly trains it to try and improve its use of the technique. Snorunt eventually evolves into Glalie while fighting Team Rocket.</description>

<description>Spheal is a spherical creature that rolls across ice floes because its body isn`t cut out for swimming. Spheal, in spite of its infancy, is fully capable of living in Arctic environments such as a tundra. Though it is not obvious, its body is fully covered in a layer of plushy fur that feels fluffy to the touch. This is surprisingly good at insulating Spheal against the cold when it is rolling about on ice floes or diving into the sea, for it apparently never feels the cold at all. When groups of Spheal eat, they instinctively show their pleasure by clapping and making other noises.</description>

Its flippers are quite powerful: they are strong enough to shatter ice with well-placed flaps. Five times a day, Sealeo dives into the sea to hunt prey.
Sealeo`s behavior revolves mostly around its sensitive nose; Sealeo uses it to investigate new things. It lifts new objects up with its nose, and rolls them around. While rolling an object, Sealeo checks the object`s aroma and texture in order to learn about it. This is what it does to differentiate food from anything else, making it a vital ability for survival. However, Sealeo also takes a liking to balancing and spinning a younger Spheal on its nose for entertainment.</description>

These tusks are strong enough to thoroughly shatter blocks of ice weighing ten tons. When alone in the Arctic seas, Walrein`s thick blubber insulates it from the extreme cold of sub-zero temperature water, and it uses its tusks to clear its way as it swims through ice floes. The blubber is also resilient enough to make enemy attacks such as bites bounce off relatively harmlessly.</description>

In the legend surrounding the three, Groudon represents the land, while Kyogre and Rayquaza represent the sea and the sky, respectively. Groudon, representing land, raised lands and expanded continents in legend. Coming as a savior for humans suffering from floods caused by Kyogre, it can dissipate clouds, and evaporate water with light and heat. After a titanic battle with Kyogre, it went to sleep in underground magma, causing volcanoes to erupt when it awakes. It is a Ground-type with the Drought ability, which makes the weather sunny until another weather move is used or a Pokémon with another weather-altering ability is switched in.
Groudon first appears in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire and Pokémon Emerald along with Kyogre and Rayquaza. Pokémon Ruby focuses on Team Magma awakening Groudon to take over the world, while Pokémon Emerald has both Groudon and Kyogre awake. The anime follows a similar structure, where both Pokémon are awakened, and forced to battle by Team Magma and Team Aqua. This is foiled by Ash Ketchum and Lance, and Groudon and Kyogre return to their respective elements after calling a truce. Groudon also plays a pseudo-role in the sixth Pokémon movie, Jirachi Wishmaker, where an evil being in the form of a Groudon is formed from the energy of Jirachi.</description>

<description>Jirachi a legendary Pokémon that first appeared in the Nintendo games Pokémon Ruby and Pokémon Sapphire. It possesses telepathic and telekinetic abilities, including the ability to levitate. Jirachi hibernates for periods of one thousand years in a crystalline cocoon. If it is ever in danger, it will fight its attacker, but not awaken from its slumber. After one thousand years have elapsed, Jirachi awakens from its sleep for one week if it is sung to in a pure voice. During this period, it is able to make wishes. If a message is inscribed onto one of the "tags" on Jirachi`s head, it will fulfill those wishes. After it fulfills the wishes, Jirachi returns to hibernation in a newly-formed cocoon, waiting another thousand years for its next master`s wish.
Jirachi is one of the primary characters of the 6th Pokémon Movie, Jirachi Wishmaker. Tomiko Suzuki, in her final role, portrayed the character in the original Japanese version. Jirachi awakens for seven days, awaiting a wish to be granted. It soon befriends Max, and travels with him until it is used to create an evil being in the form of a Groudon. It absorbs the power used to create the beast, and returns to sleep.
While Jirachi was still in its slumber, it reached out to Max. Max became fast friends with Jirachi after it awakened, and helped it break free from Butler`s machine, which was used so that Butler could awaken Groudon with the use of the Jirachi`s powers. Jirachi awakens only once every thousand years, and Max was really sad when it went back to its slumber.</description>

<description>Torterra is the final evolution of the Turtwig evolutionary line. Despite their great size, these Pokémon are peaceful in nature and enjoy being with others of their own kind, preferring to bask in sunlight as they do not like to fight. When immobile, they look as if they are part of the ground upon which they rest, not as though they were a sleeping Pokémon. Because of this appearance, there are occasions when small Pokémon will gather and build nests on the shell of a stationary Torterra. When Torterra do move, they often move in herds in search of water. Paul`s, (Ash`s Sinnoh rival`s), original starter Pokémon was a Turtwig that evolved into a Torterra.</description>

Dawn befriended Piplup after saving it from a group of Ariados, and chose it as her starter Pokémon. Piplup`s next stages, "Prinplup" and "Empoleon" are even more proud, bringing up the words prince and emperor in parts of their names.</description>

<description>Cherrim is the evolved form of Cherubi. During normal weather conditions, it appears as two crossing purple petals with a short purple stem, a green leafy sepal covering, and two deep pink feet. Similar to Castform and unlike Cherubi, however, Cherrim`s appearance changes to the cherry blossom form during sunny conditions. Though the bud form is quite docile, the flower form is much more cheerful.
In Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, its Flower Gift ability strengthens it and another Pokémon when it is sunny. Cherrim learns the existing attack Sunny Day to make the weather sunny, as well as a new attack called Lucky Chant, which prevents critical hits. Cherrim can also learn a new attack, Worry Seed, which temporarily changes the target`s ability to Insomnia.</description>

<description>Drifloon resembles a toy balloon with two strings and cross-like patch. Drifloon has a wispy cloud on its head, and the ends of its two strings resemble hearts. According to its Pokédex entry, it attempts to abduct children but is so light that it ends up being pulled along instead, much like it was a balloon on a string. Drifloon and its evolution are the only two Pokémon that are ghost- and flying-type. Its classification as the `Balloon` Pokémon is shared with Igglybuff and its evolutions Jigglypuff and Wigglytuff as well as the water/poison Pokémon Qwilfish. The creature appears in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, and the episode "Drifloon on the Wind" where it belongs to a Nurse Joy and her two daughters, Marnie (Sayaki) and Paige (Mai). Drifloon can only be obtained at the Valley Windworks on Fridays after defeating Commander Mars of Team Galactic for the first time</description>

Its name comes from the phrase "The Head Honcho" which is a nickname for the leader of a group. Honchkrow spends most of its time grooming itself in its nest, while it dispatches its Murkrow minions to bring it food. However, it sometimes flies with them in tow. This creature was introduced in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. Team Galactic Boss Cyrus uses Honchkrow in his final battle. In Pokemon Platinum it is also used in his second battle. Honchkrow and its pre-evolution, Murkrow, are exclusive to Pokémon Diamond version: Pearl players instead can catch Midreavus and Mismagius.

Wild ones are known to be brazen and will attempt to invade another Pokémon`s nest on sight. A Purugly`s head, like its previous evolution, Glameow, resembles a crescent, though the purple-tipped ears have a fringe at the end.
It is exclusive to Pokémon Pearl, where Glameow is used by many of the members of the Team Galactic antagonists; Galactic Commander Mars uses a Purugly. These Pokémon are surprisingly quick for being so robust. As to confirm a Glameow`s transition from slender to fat during evolution, a Glameow with the Limber ability will exchange it for the Thick Fat ability during evolution. A Purugly can also have the Own Tempo ability, which prevents confusion.</description>

<description>Bonsly is a small pot-like creature resembling a bonsai tree. The creature was introduced in 2004 in an issue of Coro Coro Magazine. Bonsly makes its proper and most playable debut in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, the game it was first advertised as being involved in.
Despite its tree-like appearance, Bonsly is actually made of rock. Bonsly often shed tears, though it has been found out that those are "fake tears", and that it is adjusting its body fluid level (appropriately enough, it can learn the move Fake Tears, which sharply decreases its target`s Special Defense) Wild Bonsly exist only in the Pearl Version, and upon learning how to Mimic, they evolve into the familiar Sudowoodo.
Its first anime appearance is in the eighth Pokémon movie, Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. However, its name is mispronounced in that movie; Bonsly is to be pronounced similarly to "bonsai", half of its namesake, the other being sly, for shedding "crocodile tears" Bonsly also appears in the "From Cradle to Save" episode, where Brock obtains it. Brock`s Bonsly eventually evolved into Sudowoodo.
Although regarded as a 4th generation Pokémon, it was included in the 2005 game Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, where the player must rescue one from the wreckage of S.S. Libra and reunite it with its trainer, a small girl. It also appears as a statue in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon as a reward.</description>

It has an affinity to mimicking the movements and emotions of the people and Pokémon around it. When it finally learns the move Mimic, it can evolve into Mr. Mime. Mime Jr. makes a cameo appearance as a collectable statue in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon before its true appearance in Pokémon Diamond, where wild ones can be caught.
The creature`s first anime appearance is in the eighth Pokémon movie, Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew, where it is owned by Lady Ilene, the queen of Cameron Palace. Mime Jr. appears in the second episode of Pokémon: Battle Frontier; "Sweet Baby James", where it belongs to James` Nanny and Pop-pop; the caretakers of his family`s summer mansion in Hoenn. However, it decides to travel with James and jumps into one of his Poké Balls. James is protective of Mime Jr. and doesn`t allow it to battle, but was used for contests instead.</description>

<description>Chatot can learn and speak human words (known as Chatter). The ability to learn human words is rare. It may or may not be able to comprehend what it is actually saying though, much like real parrots. If they gather, they all learn the same saying. It can also mimic sounds. When a Chatot learns its signature move Chatter, the trainer can record a custom call from the game menu. The sound is garbled to avoid the recording of obscenities. The player can trade this Pokemon for a Buizel in Eterna City.
Its head is shaped like a musical note and its tail like a metronome. Its body is covered with many multi-colored feathers giving it a resemblance to a black masked lovebird. Chatot can only be caught in the morning or during the day.
Chatot also appears in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time/Darkness as the second in command to Guildmaster Wigglytuff.</description>

<description>Garchomp is the fourth-generation non-legendary Pokémon with high total stats (especially HP, Speed, and Attack); comparable to Metagross, Salamence, Tyranitar and Dragonite. It evolves from Gabite at Level 48. The Champion Cynthia of the Sinnoh Pokémon League has a Garchomp. Garchomp has earned some notoriety as only the second non-legendary Pokémon (after Wobbuffet) to be banned from standard gameplay.
Its appearance is based off a fictional creature known as a land shark or sand shark. In the anime, Cynthia uses Garchomp in her battle against Paul, where it managed to defeat his team with relative ease. They usually prey off of Zigzagoon, Bidoof, Barboach and Whiscash but their prime favorites are Corphish, Crawdaunt, Krabby and Kingler.</description>

<description>Munchlax is the pre-evolved form of Snorlax. It wolfs down its weight in food once a day, swallowing food whole with almost no chewing. It hides food under its long body hair. However, it sometimes forgets it has hidden the food there. Munchlax behaves quite opposite of its evolution, Snorlax, as it is somewhat hyperactive, though it is very similar with its eating patterns. It does not mind walking and running from place to place as it looks for food. Munchlax eats the most food of any Pokémon besides its evolution, Snorlax. It will eat nearly anything. It can rarely become full and will eat constantly, unlike Snorlax, who eats in between sleeping.
One can obtain a Munchlax by breeding two Snorlax with the mother holding a Full Incense, or by smearing honey on trees and waiting to see if it appears. However, it is the rarest Pokémon to catch by doing so. Wild Munchlax can only be found in honey trees in the games.</description>

<description>Hippowdon is the evolved form of Hippopotas. Sand appears to be coming out of the holes on its back. Its mouth can span seven feet. It is also mentioned, in a bookcase in Harbor Inn in Canalave City, that this Pokémon created the deserts of the world, but the spirit of the desert is Flygon, and the heat was created by Camerupt. Males are colored yellow, while females are colored black. It is interesting to note that males are yellow, so that in their desert environments, they have trouble finding each other to fight. The female is colored black for the opposite reason, so she is easy to find. In the 4th gen game series for Nintendo DS, Hippowdon has the special ability called "Sand Stream", which whips up a sandstorm whenever it is introduced into battle. The sandstorm will continue until another weather condition is set, or if for example Rayquaza is switched in (because Rayquaza has an ability to negate weather effects).</description>

<description>Snover is a "frosted tree Pokémon," that first appeared in the 4th generation of Pokémon. Snover is a small, tree-like Pokémon that appears mid to late game. On its head it has a white hat-like structure resembling a mountain with three peaks.
In the spring, frozen candy-like berries grow around its stomach which are similar to frozen treats. Because of its lack of human contact, Snover is known to be boldly inquisitive. Male and female Snover vary in appearance by their stomach`s pattern, with the male having an extra brown zigzag. Snover, and its evolution Abomasnow, is a unique Grass/Ice type, giving it many different abilities than most Grass or Ice types. Its Grass/Ice combination, unfortunately, makes it weak against Fire types, Fighting types, Poison types, Flying types, Bug types, Rock types, and Steel types. On the plus side, the Grass/Ice combination makes Snover and its evolutionary form, Abomasnow, strong against Water types, Electric types, Grass types, and Ground types.
The ability Snow Warning is also unique to Snover`s line, and causes the weather to change to hail when Snover is brought into battle. This hail does not disappear over time, but must be overridden by another weather changing move or ability.</description>

<description>Abomasnow is the evolved form of Snover and, like its previous evolution, is a "Frost Tree", and has Grass/Ice typing. It blankets wide areas in snow by whipping up blizzards. In the Pokémon world, Abomasnow is the Abominable Snowman, and is also known as "The Ice Monster".
Its ability, Snow Warning, creates an everlasting hailstorm that grants its strongest attack, Blizzard, perfect accuracy. It can be found on the peak of Mt. Coronet and is the strongest Pokemon levelwise used by the seventh Gym Leader of Snowpoint City, Candice on Pokemon Diamond &amp; Pearl.</description>

<description>Lickilicky, known as the Licking Pokémon, is one of several Pokémon of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl that evolve from a Pokémon from a previous generation, Lickitung. It does so when it knows the move Rollout and levels up, but only in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. This fact makes it one of only four Pokémon (the others being Mamoswine, Tangrowth, and Yanmega) that evolve from a previously obtainable Pokémon in a way that would have been possible in previous games: by learning a certain move. Not much else can be discerned from Lickilicky`s pre-evolved form, except it can learn Explosion, meaning that it is the only Pokémon (besides Smeargle through its unique Sketch move) that can learn Explosion and receive a Same Type Attack Bonus from it as well. It has a bizarre, rather swirly protusion on its head resembling hair. Lickilicky also has thumb spikes, and a white bib-like pattern on its chest in front of the neck. This design may be based on old 60-70`s diner mascots.</description>

<description>Rhyperior, known as the Drill Pokémon, is the evolved form of Rhydon, a Pokémon from Generation I. It appears in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. It stands completely upright, and its color has changed from gray to black with burnt orange plates, formed by a type of biological "fusion" with the Protector item, needed for Rhydon to evolve. Its second horn grew out from a Rhydon having the main horn pointed forward. The female`s upper horn is smaller. In addition to its extra armor, it has developed an Ankylosaur-like tail, and holes in the palms of its hands, which it uses to fire rocks at enemies, thus why it learns the move Rock Wrecker. According to the Pokédex, it sometimes accidentally fires Geodude instead of rocks.</description>

<description>Electivire, known as the Thunderbolt Pokémon, is the evolution of Electabuzz that is first introduced in the last episode of Pokémon Battle Frontier. Electivire`s back has a symbol that looks similar to a socket outlet, similar to how a previous form of it, Elekid, resembled a plug. It has red eyes and also seems to resemble the yeti or sasquatch. The small red parts on the end of its pair of tails resemble red LEDs. According to its Pokédex entry, it can shoot 20,000 volts of electricity out of its tails.
An Electivire owned by Gary Oak was first seen on the final episode of Pokémon: Battle Frontier. He used his Electivire, which he got in Sinnoh, to beat Ash Ketchum`s Pikachu in a one-on-one battle. He later used it to help Ash protect a group of Shieldon from Hunter J.</description>

<description>Glaceon, known as the Fresh Snow Pokémon, is one of two evolutions of Eevee that is obtained from training it in a certain location, the other evolution being Leafeon. The location necessary to evolve Eevee into Glaceon is on route 217 in the Sinnoh region. There is an ice covered rock here, but it is also possible to level up anywhere in grass on route 217 to evolve. Being an ice-type, it prefers cold climates, and as a protective measure it freezes its fur completely. This freezing causes the hair to resemble "ice needles."
In the Anime, May`s Eevee evolved into a Glaceon prior to her reappearance in the episode 544 `Restaurant Seven Stars! Tag Battle for a Full Course!` and Bianca got a same Eevee and now evolved into Glaceon nicknamed Iceshocker.</description>

<description>Mamoswine, known as the Twin Tusk Pokémon, resembles a cross between a pig and a woolly mammoth. Mamoswine`s name is derived from the words mammoth and swine. The tusks are much larger than those of Piloswine and seem to be shifted downward. The tusks of the male are larger than those of the female. The tusks are made from solid ice instead of dentin like most teeth are. Mamoswine were common around the Ice Age but their numbers dwindled as the climate warmed up. It is the evolution of Piloswine from Pokémon Diamond and Pearl onwards. It evolves when Piloswine is leveled up while knowing the move Ancient Power. In order to teach it this move, the player must dig up a Heart Scale in the underground, give it to the Move Maniac in Pastoria City and request Ancient Power from the list of past learned moves. However, Ancient Power is also an egg move for Swinub.</description>

<description>Gallade, known as the Blade Pokémon, is a human-like Pokémon that seems to be the masculine counterpart to Gardevoir. This Pokémon can only be a male, evolving from a male Kirlia when exposed to a Dawn Stone. The crest on its head is reminiscent of the helmet of a hoplite. Sharp, green, spear-like blades extend from Gallade`s elbows, which Gallade uses skillfully and powerfully in battle. These blades can be retracted into Gallade`s elbows when not in combat, possibly so that it does not somehow manage to hurt those it is close to. As its evolutionary line and Gardevoir resemble elegant female dancers, Gallade may be a dancer as well. If true, Gallade may be based partly on a traditional Brazilian dance called Maculelê, which involves dancing through expressive and athletic motions and a form of sword play. Gallade are valiant and noble fighters, adept at both melee combat and swordplay. They are noble in the sense that they follow strict codes of manners and conduct in and outside of battles. This sense of honor can be compared to that of a samurai`s or knight`s. Their behavior is quite similar, in that a Gallade, as well as a Gardevoir, will protect its trainer, even if doing so could end its life. Their names are based on the word "gallant" and "blade", which represents them in many ways.</description>

<description>Dusknoir, known as the Gripper Pokémon, is the evolution of Dusclops, obtained by trading a Dusclops that is holding a Reaper Cloth. It appears only in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. Dusknoir`s body is mostly black, with four almond shaped eye-like markings (two in the front, two in the back) and a yellow horizontal zigzag line below the "eyes" along which the entire torso can open and close like a mouth, giving the impression of a face. This "face" also glows brightly when Dusknoir powers up for attacks. Dusknoir now has developed arms. Two yellow bands are near its wrists and its grey hands are similar to Dusclops`. Dusknoir has a grey, cylinder-shaped head with another yellow band near the top and a single black eye with a yellow iris and a red pupil. On top of its head is a yellow antenna which allows this Pokémon to receive transmissions from the spirit world, from where it receives commands to take people there; due to the presence of an actual "spirit world" in the games ruled by the Legendary Pokémon Giratina, a ghastly dragon that represents death, it is speculated that it is Giratina that gives orders to Dusknoir. In addition, it may have ties to the Grim Reaper, as the player needs a Reaper Cloth in order for it to evolve as well as it being a Gripper Pokemon, a possible portmanteau of "Grim" and "Reaper" altered to fit Dusknoir`s grabbing persona. Dusknoir has a ghostly tail instead of feet like Dusclops, resembling the stereotypical depiction of a genie. Its name can be translated as "black dusk", "noir" meaning "black" in French.
A male Dusknoir appears in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness as the main villain of the game. He is a tyrant from the future world and deceives everyone into trusting him and outing Grovyle as a villain, but in fact, he is an agent of Primal Dialga</description>

<description>Froslass, known as the Snow Land Pokémon, appears to be based on the Yuki-onna, a Japanese snow spirit, hence being a Ghost-type. It bears a humanoid appearance (unlike Snorunt or Glalie). Its main body color is white with a red stripe around the waist and two red fins on her back (designed to resemble a kimono obi). Froslass`s arms are attached to its head as opposed to its torso, and each has a three-fingered hand and a blue fin on the wrist (representing the sleeves of a kimono). The head is round except for a bump on the back and has a purple lower jaw. Two small blue "horns" made of ice are on Froslass`s head, along with a purple diamond-shaped crater in the center of its forehead. Froslass doesn`t have any feet, so it floats in the air like its counter-part, Glalie. Its torso appears to be hollow, as it is stated in the Pokédex`s entry for Froslass. A female Snorunt will evolve into Froslass after a Dawn Stone is used on it.
It attacks prey and unsuspecting victims in icy snowstorms, where its Snow Cloak ability allows it to go unseen (yuki-onna are said to have skin so pale that they can actually blend into their snow-covered surroundings). To render its foes and victims helpless, it blows an icy wind that can reach as low as -60˚F. Its head has a slight resemblance to Celebi`s.
A Froslass appears in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness, as a dangerous and obsessive Pokémon, who is attracted to the famous explorer Scizor, who doesn`t exactly return those affections. As a result, she kidnaps him and freezes him in ice. But when the player and partner intervene, Frosslass is stopped.</description>

It will only appear in the game if the three Regis, after being transferred via Pal Park, are in your party while examining Regigigas` body. Regigigas was sealed in the Snowpoint Temple for thousands of years, so long that moss have grown over its body, and modern humans thought it was just a statue of the Pokémon. A Sinnoh legend has it in the past Regigigas towed continents using ropes. The legend says that it had unbelievable strength, but seemingly since it has not used it in ages, it has trouble getting its act together at the beginning of a battle, evidenced by its ability, Slow Start. In Platinum, Regigigas` level is reduced to 1, making it the lowest level non-glitch wild &amp; legendary Pokémon, more evidence of the fact that it has not used its powers for millennia.</description>

<description>Phione, known as the Sea Drifter Pokémon, is a Pokémon that can be obtained by breeding Manaphy and Ditto, though Phione will not evolve into Manaphy.
It is currently the only Pokémon that cannot evolve into the Pokémon from which it is bred, and it is the only Pokémon able to be bred from a legendary. Phione itself can breed with Ditto, but it will only produce other Phione and not a Manaphy. Because of Phione`s relation to Manaphy, there is evidence on both sides of the issue of Phione`s status (or lack thereof) as a legendary Pokémon. As it is the offspring of a legendary, and is banned from the Sinnoh Battle Tower, many people think it is a legendary. However, its lackluster stats and ability to breed more of itself lent evidence to the idea that Phione was not a legendary. Its legendary status was eventually confirmed by Pokemon.com. Many things that Manaphy has two of, Phione only has one of (Phione has one antenna, only one gem on its stomach, and has one "eyelash" coming from each eye, while Manaphy has two of these).
Since it is the product of a bred Manaphy, they share many traits. It is the same shade of blue, it has the same large eyes, only blue, and has eyelash markings similar to Manaphy. It has a large knob-shaped bump on its head from which extends a long, ribbon-like antenna, somewhat resembling a sailor`s cap, though in fact it is a flotation device. Instead of feet, it has a small point, similar to Baltoy. Instead of two jewels, it has a single red gem in the middle of its tiny body. It has two large fins in proportion to its body, which it uses to navigate through the oceans that it lives in. While Manaphy is said to live in cold seas, it is said Phione live in warm seas.</description>

<description>Manaphy, known as the Seafaring Pokémon, made its debut is in the 9th Pokémon anime film, Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea, and is thought to be the "Prince of the Sea" Pokémon alluded to in the title of the Japanese movie. It was the sixth Pokémon of the fourth generation to be revealed by CoroCoro magazine. It was revealed alongside the silhouettes of three other Pokémon: Mantyke, Buizel, and Chatot.
Many years ago, a Phione accidentally laid a mysterious, bright blue egg with a red heart inside it. It eventually hatched into a smaller Phione, which was named Manaphy. Many Phione began to worship it and Manaphy became the "Prince of the Sea". When bred with Ditto, Manaphy is able to produce more Phione.
Manaphy are blue blob-like Pokémon. They have two long antennae extending from atop their head. At the end of these antennae are round objects that resemble a ball. Manaphy can use their antennae to use Heart Swap and switch people`s energy. They also have jewel-like markings on their stomachs, one large red gem and a very small yellow gem. They are said to live in cold waters, and migrate miles away from their homes only to return. Manaphy can mimic human language as the Manaphy in Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea was able to say certain words and sentences.
Manaphy is only obtainable through a Nintendo Event, or by completing Pokémon Ranger and defeating the special Manaphy mission, which will only become available after the player inputs a password. This password has been revealed by Nintendo on numerous occasions.</description>

<description>Darkrai, known as the Pitch-Black Pokémon, is a legendary Pokémon resembling a dark, sinister ghost, such as the Grim Reaper. Darkrai is a living nightmare, or a manifestation of many nightmares. Darkrai is made by necromancy and pitch-black magic. The top of its body is connected to the lower half by a tiny waist, giving it a figure shaped like an hourglass. A white substance flows from its head, obscuring much of its facial features. Its club-shaped arms have three claws each, with parts of them appearing tattered. It`s shoulders also have long tatters as well. Darkrai possesses the power to lure people into deep sleeps and show them frightning nightmares, which sometimes make it impossible to wake up. Darkrai resides on Newmoon Island, (Mirror-image of fullmoon island in which Cresselia resides) and on nights of the new moon; when it is active, it shows horrible nightmares.
Darkrai was released on July 19th, 2007 in Japan with the movie Dialga vs. Palkia vs. Darkrai, and it was released in the United States in Toys R` Us stores shortly after the showing of the English adaptation, The Rise of Darkrai. In the anime, it was featured in the movie Pokémon: The Rise of Darkrai, in which it stops Palkia and Dialga from destroying Alamos Town. He was voiced by Bill Rogers in the film.
It is the only Dark-type legendary Pokémon to date, unless Arceus is holding the Dread Plate. Its signature move, "Dark Void", attempts to put all opponents to sleep. Coupled with excellent offenses, Darkrai is not permitted in standard battling.</description>

Its body`s fur is pure white and instead of quills, Shaymin has green grass growing on its back along with pink flowers growing on the sides of its head, giving it an even more flower-like appearance. Its cry is similar to birdsong. Shaymin resides in the Flower Paradise, a flower-filled field untouched by humans. You find it at level 30. In order to go unnoticed by intruders or attackers, it utilizes its own form of camouflage, rolling up into a ball resembling a flower in a patch of grass. By doing so, it blends in with the surrounding flowers, going undetected even if the attacker is beside it. Shaymin also has the power to decompose the toxins in the air and turn the land into flower fields in an instant. It is rumored to have turned the desolate area of Floaroma Town into a fertile field. The only way to capture Shaymin without the use of glitches or cheats is to receive the item Oak`s Letter from a Nintendo Event. It is featured in the movie Giratina and the Sky Warrior. A new form has been confirmed for Shaymin called the Sky Forme, which appears in Pokemon Platinum; in this form, it appears more as a terrier than it does a hedgehog, and has large wing-like ears. Its signature move is "Seed Flare".</description>

Giratina represents the Dimensions (or perhaps inter-dimensional travel, because space and time, which lie under the control of Palkia and Dialga respectively, are dimensions in themselves). Giratina is described in the Pokémon video games as a creature that lives in a world on the reverse side of the human world. This area is in a cemetery-like ruin in the depths of Turnback Cave, a place where the dimensional boundaries are said to be distorted, and dead Pokémon are able to enter the physical world. Giratina has a long, platinum-colored, segmented body with six legs, and has ghostly wings with spikes. Giratina is featured prominently in the upcoming film `Giratina and the Sky`s Warrior` (Giratina to Sora no Hanataba: Sheimi) and in the game Pokémon Platinum where it has a new form called "Origin Forme" (オリジンフォルム), which is similar to its regular form except it has a slightly different face, wing shape, and spikes in place of legs, becoming more serpentine.
Giratina is infamous as an extremely durable wall, with astronomical defensive statistics. Its Origin Forme trades its defenses for improved offenses, but it is limited to the Platinum Orb as a hold item.
Giratina`s Another Forme looks like a basilisk, it has a beak-like mouth, it has a crown on the head, it has red eyes, it has big spikey wings, it has six legs, a serpent tail, and a bird-like cry.</description>

<description>Team Rocket is a highly organized criminal syndicate "in pursuit of evil" headed by Giovanni (called "The Boss" by his underlings) and based in Kanto. Its main focus is in stealing or capturing, then selling, rare and/or strong Pokemon, but it also conducts cruel experimental research on Pokemon. According to the Generation II games, the Team Rocket Oath says: "Steal Pokemon for profit. Exploit Pokemon for profit. All Pokemon exist for the glory of Team Rocket." Team Rocket`s final goal is to take over the world using Pokemon.
In the anime, Team Rocket is based in Kanto, with many smaller branches reaching out in Kanto and Johto. Giovanni is the Gym Leader of Viridian City during the early part of Ash`s journey. There is also an underground school for training aspiring Team Rocket members. In addition, Team Rocket had its headquarters near Pallet Town and Viridian City, but this was destroyed by Mewtwo in its rage; it is unknown where the headquarters are now. All that is known is that the headquarters are now in a large building built at the end of a canyon and guarded by many grunts, seen when Jessie, James, and Meowth returned from the Hoenn region to report back to Giovanni.</description>

<description>Jessie is one half of of the Team Rocket duo that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokemon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
Jessie`s mother, Miyamoto, was a high-ranking Team Rocket agent. When Jessie was around the age of three, Miyamoto left on a mission to the Andes Mountains to record the voice of the elusive Pokemon Mew. However, Miyamoto disappeared, and Jessie was put into a foster home which had very little money. There were times when she had no choice but to eat snow because of a lack of more nourishing food.
When she was old enough, she left home to become a Pokemon nurse in Jouto. However, the school she was enrolled in was literally for Pokemon nurses (i.e. Chansey), so she failed to graduate and left, leaving behind a Chansey she had befriended there. It is assumed that she then traveled back to Kanto, where she enrolled in Pokemon Tech, a trainer`s school, met James, and subsequently failed and dropped out. After this, Jessie and James joined a bicycle gang in Sunny Town, where Jessie was known for swinging a chain above her head as she rode her bike (nicknamed "Chainer Jess").
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between Jessie and James after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Sometime before joining Team Rocket, and it is not known when, Jessie obtained a Contest Pass in the Hoenn region. Also during the years before Team Rocket, she had several boyfriends, all of whom left her and/or treated her badly. In "Xatu the Future", she revealed that she had once worked at a T.V. station as the Weathergirl. In "From Cradle to Save" is also revealed that she once was a ninja.
She has a long-standing bitter rivalry with Cassidy, another member of Team Rocket. Another member, Wendy, held a grudge against Jessie for failing to pay for a drink (making Wendy pay), but got her revenge when she added the charge to Jessie`s overall Team Rocket bill.
In the episode "Ignorance is Blissey", Jessie was reunited with her friend Chansey from the Pokemon nurse school; Chansey had since evolved into a Blissey.
Starting in Hoenn, Jessie has become a Pokemon Coordinator, entering every contest that she could. She frequently makes it to the battle round, but usually loses there. However, in "Borrowing on Bad Faith", she finally succeeded in winning an (unofficial) contest by using Ash`s Aipom, which she had saved earlier in the episode. And, in "Team Shocker!", she finally wins an official contest with her Dustox in at Solaceon City. Later she also won a ribbon with help of her Yanmega. She has Contest Passes to compete in the Hoenn, Kanto, and Sinnoh regions.
While Jessie`s role in the Pokemon anime has not yet ended, in Toshihiro Ono`s manga, "The Electric Tale of Pikachu", she ended up married to James and with child.
Jessie seems to have a special preference for snake-like Pokemon, owning both an Arbok and a Seviper. In "The Ninja Poke Showdown", she expressed a preference for Poison-type Pokemon in general.
For unknown reasons, she, James and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation.
In the Kanto contests, Jessie disguises herself as Jessebella (which is similar to James former fiancee Jessiebelle) wearing a red dress and glasses. Eventually, Ash, Brock, Max and May finds out her true identity at the last contest.
During the Kanto Grand Festival, Jessie dresses up as Jessadia (Japanese: キャンディ・ムサリーナ Candy Musalina). and wears glasses, long white socks, a yellow and orange dress, and has her hair in pigtails. She works there as an announcer and Lilian Meridian`s assistant; Lilian herself says she may not really like "Jessadia"`s style, but recognizes her talent. In the Latin American dub, she enters Super Contests under the name Jessiebella (referencing Jessiebelle again). Jessie currently still continues to use the Jessalina disguise while participating in Super Contests.
In "Pruning a Passel of Pals!" and "Strategy With a Smile!" she once again used her Jessadia disguise to report on the Wallace Cup.
Although Jessie had entered mostly every contest in Hoenn &amp; Kanto, she lost in every single one, whether it was the first match of the Battle Rounds or the finals. But in the Sinnoh Region, she has so far won 2 ribbons using her Dustox and Yanmega.</description>

<description>Meowth is a very unique Pokémon as it has many of the characteristics of a human. It walks on two feet, talks and is as smart as any human. Meowth is currently a member of Team Rocket and he travels around with Jessie and James trying to capture Pikachu and other rare Pokémon for Giovanni.
Meowth generally finishes his sentences with "Nyaa (ニャー)" which is the equivalent of "meow" in English. This helps people remember that despite his ability to talk like a human, he still has cat character traits.
Meowth is also known for coming up with his many schemes to try to capture Pikachu. While Jessie and James always agree with Meowth and think his plans are brilliant, they are generally foiled by Ash and his friends.
Long Con to Access Raimon City Pokémon Center
Meowth schemed with Jessie, James and Doctor Zager to figure out a way for them to infiltrate the Raimon City Pokémon Center where high-leveled Pokémon are stored in a vault that is protected by a security machine scan system that would only open if Nurse Joy (Isshu) or Nurse Joy`s Audino were scanned. Meowth pretended to be no longer part of Team Rocket making up a story that his made an error while executing a certain operation and when headquarters hear of his mistake, they told him he was fired.
Ash, Iris and Cilan believed him and allowed Meowth to travel with him. Pikachu though didn`t trust Meowth even though Meowth proved on numerous occasion that it should be trusted. Meowth`s plan was put into action when they arrived at the Raimon City Pokémon Center and as soon as Nurse Joy`s Audino was scanned to open the door, Meowth turned on Pikachu and the other and captured all the Pokémon in the vault. The long con had been a success and Meowth met up with Jessie and James below the Pokémon Center. Unfortunately, they weren`t able to get away as Ash and his friends realized that Meowth had just been conning them and they were able to stop Team Rocket.</description>

<description>James is one part of of the Team Rocket trio that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokémon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
James is mostly a comedic parody of bishounen characters; the English dub in particular tends to give him a melodramatic and even campy tone. He is somewhat famous for carrying a rose, though in more recent episodes he does not display it often. Mostly, his rose is displayed in the Team Rocket motto.
The only child of millionaires, James was forced to endure formal society. At a young age, he was forcefully engaged to a girl of whom he was terrified, Jessiebelle, all because his parents wanted to have a wealthy daughter-in-law. Thus, he ran away from home, leaving behind his beloved pet Growlie. He attempted to enroll in Pokémon Tech, a trainer`s school, but, along with his new friend Jessie, flunked out. Then, with Jessie, he joined the Sunny Town bicycle gang, where he was popular for being the only gang member to have to use training wheels (nicknamed "Trainer Jim"). Eventually James, Jessie, and the bike gang went their separate ways.
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between James and Jessie after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Since he is proficient in several activities, including Pokémon haiku and PokéRinger, it is possible that he developed his skills during his temporary separation from Jessie, but this is not known for sure.
In the episode "Holy Matrimony!", James returned to his home as a result of a trap by his parents, who pretended to be dead. He was reunited with his old pet Growlie and managed to avoid marrying Jessiebelle. Growlie stayed behind when James returned to Jessie and Meowth.
James has a tendency to be swindled by a Magikarp Salesman, who has on many occasions tricked him into buying a Magikarp or other useless Pokémon and items for large sums of money.
James also has a tendency to cross-dress, but has not done it since "Pros and Con Artists". He does, however, dress up like famous celebrities as well, such as Professor Oak, Juan, and Norman.
James loves rare bottle caps and has an impressive collection of them. In the episode "All That Glitters!" it is revealed that he has "drunk enough soda pop to float an aircraft carrier".
For unknown reasons, he, Jessie and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation. However in newer episodes the balloon is shown with `jets` attached to explain how they get from one place to another faster than walking.</description>

<description>The Beginning
Ash is the main character of the Pokémon anime. Raised in Pallet Town, he started his journey to become a Pokémon Master at the age of 10. On the day that he started his journey, Ash carelessly woke up late despite being told by his mother, Delia Ketchum to get to bed. He rushed to Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory only to find out that the beginner Pokémon - Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander - had already been given out to trainers who arrived on time. However, Professor Samual Oak mentioned that there was one more Pokémon available - Pikachu. Despite constantly hitting Ash with Electric-type attacks and refusing to return to its PokéBall, Ash decided to take Pikachu along with him on his journey to become a Pokémon Master. Pikachu is cold towards Ash at first and laughs at his failures; however, when Ash saves Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow, he begins to warm up to his new trainer and the two finally become friends. After the battle with the flock of Spearow, a Ho-Oh is seen flying towards a rainbow in the sky. The PokéDex reveals that the Ho-Oh is an unidentified Pokémon. Thus, the journey of Ash and Pikachu begins.
Captures in Viridian Forest
While making his way towards Pewter City and his first Kanto League Gym Battle, Ash came upon a wild Caterpie deep within Viridian Forest. Instead of using Pikachu to battle against the wild Pokémon, Ash took his chances and threw a PokéBall without weakining the Caterpie first. Luckily, he was able to catch the Pokémon without any trouble. The capture of Ash`s Caterpie marked Ash`s first capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Caterpie the second Pokémon to join his team.
The next day, while continuing the trek through the Viridian Forest, Ash came up on a wild Pidgeotto. He tried to just throw a PokéBall like he did with Ash`s Caterpie, but Pidgeotto swatted the PokéBall away. Misty informed that he must weaken the Pokémon first before attempting to capture it. He called out Ash`s Caterpie to battle against, but Misty quickly informed him that Bug-type Pokémon are weak against Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeotto. After Pidgeotto dealt significant damage to Ash`s Caterpie, Ash recalled it and sent out Pikachu. Pikachu was able to use its Thundershock to weaken Pidgeotto and allow Ash to capture it with a PokéBall. Thus, this capture marked Ash`s second capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Pidgeotto the third Pokémon to join his team.
Later on, while still in the Viridian Forest, Ash was approached by Team Rocket, who attempted to steal his Pokémon. After defeating Meowth, James`s Koffing, and Jessie`s Ekans, Ash`s Caterpie evolved into Ash`s Metapod.
Some of Ash`s greatest accomplishments have been at the various Pokémon Leagues. He was the victor at the Orange League and the Battle Frontier. He also competed in the Indigo League and the Johto Silver Conference where he placed admirably in both those competitions as well.
Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup
Ash participated in the Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup at the Kagome Town stadium. In the first round he was in the fifth match and faced off against Marris. The match was quickly showcased and Ash won the battle and advanced to the second round while Marris was eliminated from the tournament.
The Isshu League
Ash participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where he was matched up against Trip. Trip`s Serperior was sent out to battle Pikachu and Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior`s speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter Trip`s Serperior speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round. The two met in the Pokémon Center after the battle, and Trip vowed that the next time they met that he would win. The two shook hands and parted ways.
In the first main round, Ash`s opponent was shown on the match up electronic board but not much else is known about the battle. Ash`s Scraggy participated in the second main round of the Isshu League tournament where it faced off against a Darumakka. It was able to defeat it so that moved on to the next round.
In the third round, Stephan was matched up against Ash. Cilan noted that the two of them have a very direct taste and that it would be a good battle. It was only a 3 on 3 battle but the both of them gave it their all. The first two battles of the third round setup the final match up of Stephan`s Sawk vs Ash`s Krookodile, both of which were very injured from the previous battles. Both of them did their best to muster up their reserve strength but in the end a surprise move of Aerial Ace by Ash`s Krookodile was super effective against Stephan`s Sawk and it knocked it out to give Ash the victory while eliminating Stephan from the tournament. Stephan realized after the battle that the reason that Ash withdrew Waruvial after the first battle was because Ash knew that Stephan would definitely send out Dageki, so he didn`t reveal that it knew Aerial Ace and saved until the end.</description>

<description>The Beginning
On the morning that Ash was to start his Pokémon journey, he woke up late and by the time he reached Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory, all of the beginner Pokémon were already taken. However, Professor Samual Oak did have one Pokémon left, a wild Pikachu. At first, Pikachu did not like Ash and would refuse to enter his PokéBall. He would often laugh at Ash`s failures and refused to listen to him. However, after Ash proved his loyalty to Pikachu by protecting him from a flock of Spearow, and thus began to earn Pikachu`s trust and respect. The two have since become best friends and Pikachu never leaves Ash`s side.
Since the day Team Rocket first encountered Pikachu, it has been their sole goal to capture it. Day after day, their plan to capture Pikachu has been thwarted mainly due to Pikachu`s amazingly powerful Thunderbolt that keeps on blasting them off.
On numerous occasions, Pikachu has made it evident that he is happy being a Pikachu and has no desire to evolve into a more powerful Raichu. It has proven time and time again that it is a powerful and worthy opponent to any Pokémon that dares to battle it.
Gym Battle against Burgh`s Leavanny
Pikachu was then sent out to battle Burgh`s Leavanny. Burgh`s Leavanny managed to tie up Pikachu with String Shot but unlike Ash`s Swadloon who was able to break free, Pikachu ended up getting hit with a couple of Leaf Storm attacks and a Hyper Beam before it rolled into another of Burgh`s Leavanny`s Leaf Storm attacks to break the string off its body so it could attack. Freed from the String Shot, Burgh`s Leavanny tried to tie it up again but Pikachu managed to avoid it with its speed and then knocked Burgh`s Leavanny out with a combination of Iron Tail and Electro Ball.
Gym Battle against Elesa
Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy and was then matched up with Pikachu. Pikachu made quick work of Elesa`s Emolga and knocked it out with one attack, its Iron Tail.
Elesa`s Tynamo was the last Pokémon that she used in her gym battle against Ash. It was matched up against Pikachu who had just defeated her Emonga. Pikachu had a hard time defending against the fast Tackle attack that Elesa`s Tynamo kept hitting it with but Pikachu used its Thunderbolt to create a large dust cloud leaving only a small corridor for Pikachu to focus on it and so Elesa`s Tynamo couldn`t maneuver out of the way. Pikachu one hit K.O`d Elesa`s Tynamo with a Iron Tail. The loss gave Ash the overall victory.
Battle against Alder`s Bouffalant
Ash challenged Alder to a battle and he accepted though he had been walking all night and was actually quite tired. Alder sent out his Buffron to battle Pikachu but just as the battle started, Alder fell asleep standing up and didn`t give any orders to his Buffron. Alder`s Bouffalant stood still as Pikachu began hitting it with attack after attack until it Alder`s Bouffalant finally got mad at Alder and charged at him and set him flying into a tree. After that, Alder`s Bouffalant no longer wished to battle and Alder conceded the battle.
Gym Battle against Skyla
In Skyla air battle simulation, Ash`s Tranquill was matched up against Skyla`s Unfezant and since her Pokémon was the highest evolved form, she determined that her Pokémon would be the winner in that match-up. In the actual gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was up against Skyla`s Unfezant which was the match-up just after Ash`s Tranquill had defeated Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla`s Unfezant proved to be stronger and faster than Ash`s Tranquill, so Ash recalled it and set out Pikachu. Pikachu had a definite advantage over Skyla`s Unfezant with its electric attacks and it quickly knocked it out with its Electro Ball attack.
Ash Just after Pikachu ended up knocking out Skyla`s Unfezant, Skyla`s Swanna was sent out to battle against it. Skyla had been watching her grandpa`s battle videos and noticed that he used the move Aqua Ring to defend against Electric attacks. She used that same defense against Pikachu which nullified its Electric attacks. It`s Iron Tail also couldn`t hit it so high in the air. Ash then noticed the rings in the air and Pikachu jumped up on them and managed to hit Skyla`s Swanna but not directly. Pikachu was now up in the air though and Skyla`s Swanna had the advantage there and it quickly knocked Pikachu out with a powerful Brave Bird attack.
Battle Against Trip`s Serperior at the Isshu League
Pikachu participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where it is was matched up against Trip`s Serperior. Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter its speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round.</description>

<description>He is a Pokémon researcher that was once a competitive Trainer, and is generally considered the best in his field. As such, his role in the Pokémon games and anime is that of a mentor to young Pokémon Trainers, a source of information and an occasional plot device. Amongst other things, he is credited with inventing the Pokédex. He also hands out a Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander to beginning trainers (depending on which Pokémon the trainer chooses) to start their adventure in the Kanto Region. Although he is an expert on all matters relating to Pokémon, Professor Oak specializes in Pokémon behavioural science. He appears in Pokémon 4Ever as a child who was pulled into the future by Celebi. Additionally, it is apparent after Pokémon 3: The Movie that he knew Delia Ketchum since she was a child; this most likely is the reason he occasionally exhibits parental-type concern (mainly in the form of scolding Ash as he is doing something that is dangerous). He also creates poems centred around Pokémon and is known as the rhyming professor by Dawn.</description>

<description>When Ash and co. were traveling towards Daybreak Town for Dawn`s next Pokémon Contest, a mysterious Pokémon Trainer specializing in martial arts, named Clayton, challenged Ash and his Buizel to a battle after seeing how Buizel saved Gible who had fallen into a river. Clayton`s Mr. Mime proved to be a really strong opponent, though, as it managed to dodge Buizel`s Aqua Jet and SonicBoom attacks by skillfully using its Psychic and Double Team moves, eventually knocking Buizel out with a powerful ThunderPunch. Ash and Buizel, determined to make up for the loss by getting stronger, started training with Clayton`s help so that Buizel could learn a new move; Ice Punch. He told them that, in order to master the move, they had to work on improving their speed and concentration.
At first, the progress of Ash`s Buizel`s training seemed to be really slow. However, after training overnight using unstable and light objects as targets for its punches, like floating leaves, Buizel managed to master the move completely. After the completion of Buizel`s training, Ash challenged Clayton to a rematch, and Clayton accepted. Ash`s Buizel proved to be more of a challenge for its opponent, Mr. Mime, this time and after activating its ability, Swift Swim, in the midst of the battle due to a sudden rain, Buizel managed to increase its speed and finish Clayton`s Mr. Mime off with a powerful Ice Punch. Clayton then acknowledged Ash`s Buizel`s improvement and praised its skills, but also put emphasis on the fact that Buizel still had a long way to go and had to keep on training.</description>
