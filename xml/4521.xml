<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="480768">I`ve heard and read a lot of flak about this after I saw it, several times mind you. Flak that ranged from "More plot holes than the holes on a piece of swiss cheese" to unoriginal and god knows what else. Bullshit is what I say! This is the best damn mecha out there and we all know it. Go watch it, you will not regret it. Funny, interesting, engaging, sad, heartwarming, emotional and much much more! I`d rate this a 9,5/10!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="697643">Simply awesome and a must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="578755">This anime is so good that u don`t stop to watch when u start.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="246165">Think of the most awsome thing you have ever seen.
Well multiply that by 100 and you have Code Geass</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="372933">Perfect Watch it</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="303784">one of the best anime ive seen i RECOMMEND this anime high!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="445399">It`s a unique plot. Not a standard good vs bad plot, but something different. You should watch both this and the second season.
It`s what got me into anime personally, i watched a few shows before this but compared to code geass it was bland to say the least.

There are a few moments i disliked, but frankly no anime can be 10/10.

Just watch this, you`ll like it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="200225">Anime of the year 2007, I would say :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="294739">This animes has a super good story, and it`s a nice sci fi</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="347030">Overall a very well developed anime&lt;br /&gt;Storyline&lt;br /&gt;Character Development&lt;br /&gt;Graphics&lt;br /&gt;Music&lt;br /&gt;Designs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all too good &amp;lt;3&lt;br /&gt;Watch second season too</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="214346">Great plot and kick ass action!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="51579">Don`t be fooled by first impressions. Don`t get angry over everyone being way too skinny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank Jimi Hendrix (GOD), this series is ONLY drawed by Clamp, `cause I am really tired of reading their stories which only tell about their personnal problems living in their own world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that little observation, this anime is brilliant. It`s overall well planned, meaning the fame didn`t affect the quality of the show and the care that any respected series should show to the authors.You have a lot of character development and, like I mentioned in Hhoney &amp; Clover recommendation review, all the characters are fascinating.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="75426">probably in my all time favorite anime show list. MUST watch this show, it is incredible.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="328481">not gonna make it an offense...but its a shame if there is a people who read this but still didn`t watch the episode</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="66705">Tämä on Clampin tuotos, joten se on melko nolo. Kauheaa poseeraamista ja palopuheita. Mutta tämä oli myös varsin koukuttava ja kiinnostava, joten voi koittaa häiritseekö nolous. Toinen tuotantokausi mulla on tosin jäänyt kesken...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="218377">Its like GUndam Seed (same plot and characters) except mixed with DeathNote (minus the book).</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="66548">A good anime. Very well balanced in plot, characters and mood.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="40254">Seems very weird and strange at first, but draws you in pretty fast. After the first two or three episodes you can`t stop watching! Evil (or not?) genius at its best. Interesting characters, character development, plot and setting makes for a compelling show. Add awesome battles and top-notch animation and sound. 9/10</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="31940">gundam meets death note</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="65380">Not your average anime. Superb!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="9746">Many unforeseeable plot twists, cool characters, high quality.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="229783">Faced with betrayal and then abandoned, he holds up his black mask and fights back with a new agenda, Zero. A Fallen Prince Strikes back at the Kingdom! Using wits and smarts, he easily dominates the chessboard and battlefield alike!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="135233">An epic anime with exciting fight scenes, interesting story and a powerful protragonist</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="502052">Amazing Anime. Must see!!!!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="433878">Great story with a fitting ending.
Every action taken by the main character results in a consequence, unpleasant ones by the most part, but that`s part of this show`s appeal. Zero`s world is a harsh and lonely one.
Worth watching without a doubt.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="185992">You have a forsaken protagonist that has attributes of an anti-hero who is out for revenge. This is an extraordinary series. In the wake of his new ability the path to his grand ambition is clear. It is a long one filled with carnage, malice, deceit, betrayal all supplemented with a twisted facade of friendship. This is an anime that you just cannot afford to miss.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="179096">MECHA CHESS SCHOOL LIFE SUPERPOWERS WORLD DOMANATION

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="555526">Awesome anime. This is one of the "most intelligent" animes I`ve ever seen. I enjoyed this show a lot and If you`re a fan of freedom struggle against authoritarian state/tyranny you will love this anime. When you are a fan of "V for Vendetta" it is more than a must see for you.
Every episode was exciting and it never got bored. With 50 episodes its a very, very good watch and rewatchable too (watched the anime 5 times).</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="536304">Amazingly good.
Machiavellian plot that will keep you guessing right till the end.
Check your bandwidth, you`ll be getting R2 as well :)
Just watch and enjoy !!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="570845">This is, without a doubt, one of the greatest anime of all time. Watch it if you like anime, nay, watch it if you like any work of art.

And don`t worry about all the people whining about the ending. The ending of this series is one of the most powerful and moving experiences I have ever had. Quit reading this and watch it, you wont regret it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="147092">Protagonist is awesome. Not one of those wishy washy heroes.  He`s dark and good.  More depth to a `hero` than the typical black/white anime. Plotline is very intriguing.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="301144">Freaking awesome anime, just freaking awesome, the storyline is ... is... some of the best one i`ve seen in a lot of animes, this is a must have, must see.&lt;br /&gt;50/10 if possible</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="427003">Killing kind! But I recommend that you see MSGundam Seed and Death Note first to really enjoy it. It`s like a closure for the previous as to me they failed at the end.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="190028">The anime has a high level of intrigue and battles are fought with intelligence, tactics and logics as much as strong arms. The ever-twisting plot lines, and the even more twisted characters make this anime a worth watch, this combined with the very well made art, animation and plot make this anime a must-see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="345948">If there is an anime that crosses the boundaries of just cool and awesome... Well I can`t tink of anyting more worthy of this title. All Hail Code Geass!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="382047">Very in depth character plot and psychological and actual battles.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="201805">the story is just fabulous believe me I saw the end before the series and even so I was never expecting what happened in the series...and I cried again in the end xD</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="386693">Best of bests!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="417398">It`s a must see! It is the definition of "epic" itself. What are you waiting for? Just give it shot, you will absolutely love it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="586959">I have seen this anime before when i was still a newbie and watched it in dub, and i recently rewatched this in sub. I gotta say this was one of the best meachs with the coolest protagonist ever</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="460841">The Anime that is responsible for making me an Otaku. Ive watched it three (3) times from R1 to R2 (with an interval of few months apart).

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="108395">Great plot twists with an epic protagonist. Must see!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="20294">Die ist wirklich klasse! Der Mecha Kram ist nur am Rande, bzw. Mittel zum Zweck, nicht selbtszweck der Serie. Die Handlung ist dafür geil. Vielschichtig, komplex genug aber ohne total zu verwirren. Mit wirklich interessanten Entwicklungen. Teilweise recht böse. Sehr gut geschrieben!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="464550">One of the best animes around</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="281309">EPIC - MIND BLOWING

one of the best animes ever produced
personally i hate mecha but this anime is about the mind games and complex characters that make this series unpredictable

no exaggeration - one of the best</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="199638">Probably anime of the year 2007!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="480622">Code Geass is the best of All the Anime.
No time is wasted on the story. Efficient use of time. Well planned story.

Lelouch is the master all behind the protagonist that accidentally create chaos and tragedy. At first look to this type of mecha robotic it`s doesn`t attract me, but whenever I follow up to the story, it bring a lot of shock and surprise. It did give me wonder about the overall story, and made me feel to watch it over. Truly, no other anime could match this anime. If and only if you could understand the anime, you`ll think it`s great. Otherwise you`ll need to watch it repeatedly.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="394731">this is the best anime i have ever seen,it is full of twists and you will be left speechless before this masterpeace... THIS ANIME IS MUST SEE FOR ALL</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="420280">Normally I HATE mecha`s and everything similar, but .... This show is way too good to ignore.
Characters and plot are excellent!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="446193">Even though it`s essentially a prequel for the real action yet to come, Code Geass kicks off the series strong and keeps it rolling with an ever-twisting dramatic plot, and a charismatic and clever lead supported by a flavorful cast.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="481315">One word intense. Code Geass is one hell of a ride. Story is amazing and so is the protagonist. Just be sure to have 3 days of empty schedule when you start this series.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="320398">Screw Gundam,this is the best thing Sunrise made after Gintama.Girl love the bishies,boys the mecha,epicness knows no limits here folks.Awesome music,art etc.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="291829">If you don`t like mecha, please don`t look at the categories ... believe me ... I definitely don`t like mecha and I liked it ... a lot ;]</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="513858">really good story and awesome show</recommendation>

<description>Japan has been invaded and conquered by the http://anidb.net/ch15617 [Britannian Empire]. Japan is now known as Area 11 and its citizens known as Elevens. The Britannian Empire takes away Japan`s autonomous power and imposes its rule through the use of Knightmares. The Empire`s rule has never faltered, but cracks have begun to show...
Source: ANN
The Britannian youth, http://anidb.net/ch103 [Lelouch], received a special power from a mysterious girl. GEASS. An absolute power which allows the user to give orders to anyone. Lelouch decided to plan the destruction of the Britannian Empire by using this as a weapon. His goals are to take revenge for his http://anidb.net/ch15620 [mother], and to create a world in which his little sister, http://anidb.net/ch2000 [Nunnally], could live in peace. All while knowing that what lies ahead is his http://anidb.net/ch10629 [father], the Emperor of Britannia.</description>

<name>immortality</name>
<description>Immortality is the ability to live in a physical or spiritual form for an infinite or inconceivably vast length of time. Humans, whose life span is limited and who die of age, disease and external trauma, have long sought ways to extend their lives; the Epic of Gilgamesh, considered one of the first great literary works created by mankind, is primarily the quest of a hero seeking to become immortal. The advances of science, in particular medicine and engineering, and especially in the last few centuries, have helped people extend their life span and may yet continue finding ways to do so.
In fiction, immortals are not quite as uncommon as in real life, and the possible implications of endless or very long lives are often explored. Such implications include, but are not limited to: repeatedly accompanying the deaths of those dear to them; having to hide their condition from the mortals surrounding them; becoming disillusioned with their lives and being unable to kill themselves; and even staying forever trapped in the body of a specific physical age, that body most often being that of a child. As such, while many may wish for immortality, it may be little more than a curse for the few who have it.</description>

<description>People suffering from psychosis can be described as having lost their contact with reality and deteriorated their social functioning to the point of becoming deranged.

Usually, psychotic villains will not show themselves to suffer from mental disorders at first, and will seem like completely normal people; however, as their story unfolds and the show progresses towards its climax, it is usual to have psychotic villains become more and more deranged, to the point of being best described by "batshit insane".</description>

<name>cyborg</name>
<description>A cyborg is a cybernetic organism (i.e. an organism that has both artificial and natural systems). The term was coined in 1960 when Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline used it in an article about the advantages of self-regulating human-machine systems in outer space. D. S. Halacy`s Cyborg: Evolution of the Superman in 1965 featured an introduction which spoke of a "new frontier" that was "not merely space, but more profoundly the relationship between `inner space` to `outer space` -a bridge...between mind and matter." The cyborg is often seen today merely as an organism that has enhanced abilities due to technology, but this perhaps oversimplifies the category of feedback.
Fictional cyborgs are portrayed as a synthesis of organic and synthetic parts, and frequently pose the question of difference between human and machine as one concerned with morality, free will, and empathy. Fictional cyborgs may be represented as visibly mechanical (e.g. the Cybermen in the Doctor Who franchise or The Borg from Star Trek); or as almost indistinguishable from humans (e.g. the "Human" Cylons from the re-imagining of Battlestar Galactica). The 1970s television series The Six Million Dollar Man featured one of the most famous fictional cyborgs. Cyborgs in fiction often play up a human contempt for over-dependence on technology, particularly when used for war, and when used in ways that seem to threaten free will. Cyborgs are also often portrayed with physical or mental abilities far exceeding a human counterpart (military forms may have inbuilt weapons, among other things).
Real (as opposed to fictional) cyborgs are more frequently people who use cybernetic technology to repair or overcome the physical and mental constraints of their bodies. While cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals, they can be any kind of organism.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>absurdist humour</name>
<description>Surreal humour, also known as absurdist humour, is a form of humour predicated on deliberate violations of causal reasoning, producing events and behaviours that are obviously illogical. Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, non-sequiturs, irrational or absurd situations, and expressions of nonsense.
The humour arises from a subversion of audience`s expectations, so that amusement is founded on unpredictability, separate from a logical analysis of the situation. Its appeal stems from the fact that the situation described is exceedingly ridiculous or unlikely.
On an analytical level, all jokes contain a certain amount of incongruity, but while regular jokes carry an incongruity that the audience accepts as compatible with expectations, absurd jokes are characterized by a disproportionate amount of it, with the punch line delivering a situation incompatible with the world as we know it and failing to resolve the matter in the audience`s eyes.

<description>Even though school clubs in Japan are not mandatory, there is some pressure from the social grid (e.g. fellow students, teachers) to participate in some kind of after-school activity, be it in sports or arts. Colleges also have clubs.
As a comedy element in anime, some students have joined too many clubs, and are thus constantly stressed out. There is also the element of social commentary, making it clear that you have to join a club, if you want to be part of the class. Since self-founded clubs need at least 3 members, the desperate search and advertising for new members can be cause for hilarity in anime.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<description>The thriller is a genre of fiction in which tough, resourceful, but essentially ordinary heroes are pitted against villains determined to destroy them, their country, or the stability of the free world. The hero of a typical thriller faces danger alone or in the company of a small band of companions. The protagonist may be a law enforcement agent, a journalist, or a soldier, but typically he or she is cut off from the resources of "their" organization. More often the hero is an ordinary citizen drawn into danger and intrigue by circumstances beyond their control.

<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>racism</name>
<description>Racism is prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of an ethnically different background based on the pseudo-scientific belief that biological differences between peoples form so-called "races" and that one`s own "race" is superior to another, possibly also holding that members of different "races" should be treated differently. Some definitions include only consciously malignant forms of discrimination, and some views include discriminatory behaviors and beliefs based on cultural, national, ethnic, caste, or religious stereotypes. In works of fiction, this may also include similar actions against other sentient species.

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<name>talking is a free action</name>
<description>Time in comics is flexible. Each panel shows a single event, which is usually accompanied by a length of dialog, which must take some time to say. This disparity is usually accepted if it isn`t taken to extremes.
But often, characters will exposit when it`s most needed: at the story`s climax, when both the intricacies of the plot and the intensity of action hit their highest.
While the Heroes Outrun the Fireball, Mr. Exposition might explain why the Evil Overlord`s death caused the explosion. The Action Girl can deliver impressive lectures on why the monster`s Achilles` Heel will work, while still engaging in Waif-Fu. The Superhero can quip to his heart`s content and explain his abilities while dueling one insignificant mobster, or deliver a Kirk Summation during the course of a single Finishing Move. Sometimes even apparent mere mortals can give a lecture on what is happening when it would be a much better idea to simply run like hell.
Without stopping to breathe, apparently.

On the one hand the forms of behaviour can include non-violent methods such as the (overlapping but not quite identical) phenomena of civil disobedience, civil resistance and nonviolent resistance. On the other hand it may encompass violent campaigns. Those who participate in rebellions, especially if they are armed rebellions, are known as "rebels".&#13;

<description>The Final Battle has begun. The two opponents square off, and one of them hits the other with a series of mighty blows that would fell a mountain. But what`s this? Nothing seems to be happening! That`s when your opponent tells you that You Are Already Dead, right before your head explodes, your body separates in two, or you disintegrate into a fine mist. If you`re unlucky, only one of those happens. Sometimes, you may also discover that you were Made of Explodium.
A common trope in martial arts series, this involves some form of Finishing Move that does not take effect immediately. When used with martial arts, it may involve Pressure Point attacks or some form of Ki Attacks. Assassins may use Universal Poison to achieve a similar effect. In video games, Damage Over Time abilities often have this effect.
When used with swords there are a number of common variations, often shown with a Diagonal Cut. In sword duels, the two sides charge each other and attack. There will be a pause as the two pose, then one (or both) will fall down. Another one is for a Master Swordsman to perform a series of lightning-fast slashes, and then slowly and dramatically sheath their sword (with an audible *click*) before their attacks take effect.
This trope is not necessarily limited to martial arts, either. In more modern settings, gunshot wounds can often have this effect, since getting shot typically feels like getting punched hard and it is not uncommon for victims to take some time to realize it. This can be exploited for dramatic effect in war movies, where fatally wounded soldiers wander the battlefield before succumbing.

It has since then evolved into a modern art form. The goal of this art is to transform a flat sheet of material into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques, and as such the use of cuts or glue are not considered to be origami. Paper cutting and gluing is usually considered kirigami.

<description>There is some intellectual battle between the characters. They each might attempt to discern what the other knows and/or could be planning. Then, rather than simply relying on the use of raw power, try to deduce an effective strategy to foil their opponent(s). The battle of wits can be in the center of the intrigue or just a side story.
Examples: Death Note, Code Geass</description>

<name>mundane made awesome</name>
<description>Sometimes normal just doesn`t cut it. Eating: you put food in your mouth and chew. Playing sports: you throw a ball around. You need to make it awesome, no matter how mundane it is.
Let`s throw in some gripping orchestral music, lighting changes, different camera angles, something! Don`t write like a man, write like an evil overlord! Exaggerate your expressions and gestures, speak with excessive intonation, and if all else fails, throw in some close-ups, slow motion, and ominous Latin chanting! With practice, even you can turn something like eating chips into an epic battle of light and dark, blinding the viewer with sheer awesomeness.

<name>just as planned</name>
<description>A term usually used to describe a situation, where a seemingly smart and cunning villain sets up a plan that seems grand and impressive, but is actually long winding, ridiculous, and convoluted. And all of that just to trick his opponent(s), like the hero or anybody else, into doing things exactly as he planned. Suffice to say that the villain could have reached his goal by much shorter and easier means, it just wouldn`t seem as awesome anymore.
The phrase is also known as the original Japanese "keikaku doori" where keikaku stands translated for "plan" or "schedule", and doori for "in accordance with ..." or "following ...".
The phrase is a reference to http://anidb.net/ch301 [Yagami Light] from http://anidb.net/a4563 [Death Note], and his love for plans.</description>

<name>Super Robot Wars</name>
<description>Super Robot Wars is a series of tactical role-playing video games produced by Banpresto. The main feature of the franchise is having a story that crosses over several popular mecha anime, manga and video games, allowing characters and mecha from different titles to team up or battle one another. Due to the nature of crossover games and licensing involved, only a few games have been released outside Japan, and in English; early English-language games only feature Banpresto`s original characters and mecha, and a flagship installment were to never be released until 2016, with the English release of Super Robot Wars V in Southeast Asian countries. The franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2016.

She also likes to withhold information, usually telling people just enough to leave them wondering. C.C. has a strong penchant for pizza, especially Pizza Hut`s; she constantly orders pizzas to Lelouch`s house using his credit card.</description>

<name>Kouzuki Kallen</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kallen Stadtfeld is a Britannian-Japanese girl, who believes herself to be a Japanese person at heart and prefers to be known by her birth name, Kouzuki. Her father is Britannian and her mother is an Eleven; her father comes from a prestigious Britannian family, which Kallen benefits from. Her brother, Naoto Kouzuki, with whom she had a deep connection, was a former leader of her resistance cell before his death.
Kallen is a highly-skilled Knightmare Frame pilot, rivaling the abilities of even the Knights of the Round. She is acknowledged as the best pilot of the Black Knights by enemies and allies alike. Her codename, "Q-1," is the Queen`s starting spot in descriptive chess notation. In Lelouch`s assessment of the core members of the Black Knights, her "Combat Ability" score is 100 out of 100, matching that of Kyoshiro Tohdoh; she also has the highest possible "Loyalty" score of 100.
Even when piloting outdated Knightmare Frames such as the Glasgow, Kallen proves to be a dangerous opponent easily defeating numerous Sutherlands, despite the Sutherland being a more advanced Knightmare. With the radiation arm of her Guren Mk-II, Kallen can take down almost any Knightmare Frame in a single attack should they allow her to make physical contact, and later models also have numerous secondary attack modes for mid- and long-range combat. Her Knightmare Frame is also incredibly fast, allowing her to fight on the same level as some of the most advanced Knightmare Frames in the series.
Outside of a Knightmare, Kallen displays superior fighting abilities. She is nimble enough to swat a bee with a single swipe (and cut it in half), and on two occasions she defeats numerous armed men with little trouble. She is also apparently intelligent, since her grades in school are top of the class despite frequent absences.</description>

In this guise, he forms the Order of the Black Knights, initially composed of the members of Kaname Ohgi`s resistance group. The goal of this vigilante group is a campaign against powerful individuals who oppress the helpless, which he eventually expands into reforming Japan as an independent nation.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Schneizel el Britannia is the Second Prince of the Holy Britannian Empire and the Prime Minister of Britannia. He is one of the primary antagonists of the series and a strategist on par with Lelouch, as he is the only person whom Lelouch was unable to beat in chess as a child. Schneizel is ruthless and cold as a strategist, willing to sacrifice lives without a second thought to achieve his ends, but he is also very charismatic and caring toward his subordinates. He seems to show disdain for force when it is unnecessary, as he negotiates a peace treaty with the Euro Universe despite dominating them in every military engagement.
When Lelouch becomes Britannia`s 99th Emperor, Schneizel, alongside the Black Knights and other soldiers opposing Lelouch, confront him. Upon Schneizel`s defeat, Lelouch uses his Geass on him to make him follow Zero`s orders, having anticipated that Suzaku would take on the persona after Lelouch dies.</description>

<description>Rakshata Chawla is an Indian scientist who secretly backed the Kyoto Group before becoming the head of the research and development team of the http://anidb.net/ch2353 [Order of the Black Knights], where she was tasked with developing Japanese Knightmare Frames. She has extensive experience in medical cybernetics. Though she is not fond of speaking of the past, Rakshata is known to have studied at the Imperial Colchester Institute. She is fairly laid back in most situations, usually seen laying on a couch when not actively working, and is never seen without her tobacco pipe. She is visibly enraged, a contrast to her normal demeanor, upon learning that http://anidb.net/ch15098 [Lloyd] and http://anidb.net/ch15096 [Cecile] modified the Guren without her consent. She used to be a colleague of Lloyd`s, but parted ways with him. Upon the formation of the http://anidb.net/ch15673 [United Federation of Nations] and the reorganization of the Order of the Black Knights as its military force, Rakshata is designated as the Chief of Science, a post similar to her previous position within the Order. She reacts to the Black Knights` betrayal of Zero with apathy, being more concerned with the aftermath of the affair. She is captured and imprisoned along with the rest of the Black Knights after the fall of http://anidb.net/ch1999 [Schneizel]. Rakshata is the creator of the http://anidb.net/ch8835 [Guren Mk-II] and of its upgrades, and its most powerful weapon, the so-called "radiation wave", is her original idea. She also developed the Gefjun Disturber, a force field generator that disables all sakuradite-powered technology within its area of effect. In http://anidb.net/a5373 [the second season], Rakshata also creates the http://anidb.net/ch15615 [Shinkirou] for http://anidb.net/ch1697 [Zero]`s personal use.

<name>Guren Mk-II</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>The Guren Mk-II is a Knightmare Frame model designed by Indian engineer Rakshata Chawla, manufactured by Japan, and built by the Kyoto House. It is radically different from its Britannian counterparts, and its technology is on par with most seventh generation Knightmare Frames, a fact that is a source of pride for its manufacturers. The later Gekka models were based on the Guren`s technology. Unlike Britannian made Knightmare cockpits, the Guren Mk-II features an unconventional pilot seat shaped in the form of a motorbike seat, and a helm-like outgrowth surrounding its retractable head.
The Guren Mk-II`s main weapon is its silver right hand. The hand stands out from the otherwise red-painted mech, terminating in clawed fingers, and it can extend at the elbow for a surprise attack. Stored within the palm is the Fukushahadou, a powerful microwave radiation emitter. By grabbing onto an enemy Knightmare and activating the emitter, the Guren Mk-II can fry the enemy`s electronics and warp the frame itself, not only rendering the unfortunate machine completely unsalvageable, but often damaging the pilot`s ejection system, usually ensuring that the pilot will perish with his craft. While not designed as such, the Fukushahadou can also function as a shield. It has been shown to block the lances of enemy Knightmares, bullets from Knightmare rifles, and a shell from the Lancelot`s VARIS rifle, though the latter damages the arm on the first attempt. The arm is destroyed in the battle of Tokyo, but is replaced with a slimmer, three-fingered version in the second.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Sumeragi Kaguya is the 14-year-old head mistress of the Kyoto House (15 during R2), and a supporter of the Black Knights. Kaguya is Suzaku`s cousin, and met Lelouch and Nunnally during their childhood at the Kururugi Shrine. She is the representative of Sumeragi Concern, a large conglomerate founded by the Sumeragi House. Despite her age and physique, she possesses a strong will and is highly influential amongst the Houses. She is named after Kaguya, the main character of what is considered to be the oldest Japanese folktale.
Kaguya has admired Zero since his debut, and wishes to have his hand in marriage. She claims to be his wife in the second season, though she admits that they are only husband and wife in name. She doesn`t mind him dallying with other women; she claims "a true hero enjoys physical pleasures," and proceeds to suggest that she, Kallen, and C.C. are Zero`s harem, noting their likeness to the Three Court Ladies.</description>

<name>Charles zi Britannia</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Charles zi Britannia, at first only referred to as The Emperor of Britannia (ブリタニア皇帝, Britannia Koutei), born August 4, 1955 a.t.b., is Lelouch`s father and the 98th Emperor of the Holy Britannian Empire as well as one of the main antagonists of the series. He has 108 different consorts. A strong proponent of Social Darwinism, he views equality as an evil that must be dispelled, and to this end he encourages class conflict and military expansionism so as to maintain social evolution and progress. He also suffered a horrific childhood of his family murdering each other for succession, forging a pact with his brother V.V. to create a world without lies. Acquiring allies in Marianne and C.C., Charles created the Sword of Akasha, a weapon designed to facilitate the Ragnarök Connection, remaking the world into a place without lies by killing "God", which is the collective individual unconsciousness of all mankind.
However, when V.V. murdered Marianne and denied his part in her death, Charles was forced to alter the memories of Nunnally before sending her and Lelouch to Japan as political hostages during the sakuradite conflict. Since then, the Emperor focused more on his goals while having his remaining children deal with Britannian matters. Eventually after taking V.V.`s code to become immortal, Charles starts up the final preparations of the Ragnarök connection, revealing the entire truth and that C.C.`s code is the last piece to complete the plan. However, Lelouch sees Charles` ideal world to be nothing more than stagnation that would doom mankind rather than save it, and he uses his Geass to break collective unconsciousness from the connection while having his father dissolve into nothingness. With his last breath, Charles warns Lelouch his rejection of the world he envisioned would only allow Schneizel`s to become a reality.
The Emperor initially possesses a Geass power given to him by V.V. which allows him to suppress memories and create false ones through eye contact. It can also suppress the Geass power of the target, even if it is permanently active. This power, however, is not unbreakable. A victim`s true memories can be supplied by someone else or recalled by extraordinary force of will; doing so will break the Geass and restore any Geass the victim may possess. It can also be broken with a Geass Canceler. During Lelouch`s assault on the Geass Order, he takes on V.V.`s "Code," exchanging his Geass for immortality. The Code mark is situated on his right palm.</description>

<name>Toudou Kyoushirou</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Toudou Kyoushirou is the head of the Black Knights` military operations, and an extremely talented fighter in his own right. He earned the nickname Toudou of Miracles for his singular defeat of the otherwise unstoppable Holy Britannian Empire during the invasion of Japan, remarkably managing this feat without the use of Knightmare Frames. This event would later be known as the Miracle of Itsukushima. He was a childhood instructor to Kururugi Suzaku, and is one of the few Japanese people who understands his ideals. Toudou is often seen bearing a katana at his side.
Toudou is initially a member of the Japan Liberation Front, and resigns himself to death when the organization is wiped out. Zero convinces him to join the Black Knights in order to fulfil the promise of victory created by the Miracle of Itsukushima. Like Kaname, he remains faithful to Zero following his capture during the Black Rebellion, reasoning that Zero must have had a good reason not to inform his troops about his plans. He later leads Black Knight forces in liberation operations throughout the Chinese Federation and the Middle East before being named Chief of Staff of the newly reorganized Black Knights which serve as the national army of the UFN. Asahina`s last transmission about Zero`s massacre helps fuel his doubts about trusting Zero, which influences him when Schneizel reveals Zero`s identity to them. After losing a battle with Suzaku and being gravely wounded, he attempts to go back to the battlefield despite Nagisa Chiba`s pleads, but collapses because of his injuries.
Toudou and the remaining Black Knights are made prisoner and later taken away for public execution along with Schneizel and the U.F.N representatives. When Suzaku assassinates Lelouch as the last part of the Zero Requiem, a shocked Toudou appears to realize what has happened, voicing aloud his confusion. Before he can finish the thought, Kallen asserts that the Zero before them is the real Zero. He is last seen together with Chiba in traditional Japanese attire in a photo of Kaname Oogi`s wedding with Villetta Nu.</description>

<name>Ougi Kaname</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Ougi Kaname is the leader of the original resistance cell. He took over leadership following the death of Kallen`s older brother, Kouzuki Naoto (紅月ナオト), leaving his teaching job to do so. He is a somewhat reserved individual who lacks self-confidence, often questioning his ability to lead. However, he is also fairly perceptive, recognizing Zero`s intentions to a degree and even deducing some of the things he keeps secret from the organization. Kaname turns over leadership of his resistance cell to Zero after Zero proves himself the more competent and effective commander. When Zero reorganizes the Black Knights, he appoints Ohgi as deputy commander.
Following a battle in which the Japan Liberation Front is all but wiped out, Ohgi finds Villetta Nu left for dead at a ship dock. He nurses her back to health, and lets her live with him when she cannot remember who she is. Though he knows she has seen Zero`s face (Villetta having said so when he recovered her), he cannot bring himself to kill her or use Refrain to recover her memories. Over time, he falls in love with her. During the Black Rebellion, Ohgi is shot by Villetta, who has regained her memories.
Despite being captured in the Black Rebellion, Ohgi maintains his faith in Zero, knowing that Zero alone can liberate Japan. During the opening ceremony for the second Special Administration Region in Japan, he prevents Villetta from being shot. She suspects it is him, but he doesn`t confirm her suspicions and bids her farewell. Later, Villetta arranges a meeting with Ohgi, intending to kill him to erase her links to the Elevens. Ohgi comes knowing full well what she intends to do, and confesses his love for her. Villetta is captured during an altercation with Sayoko and held hostage by Diethard to ensure Ohgi`s loyalty, but is set free shortly after the second battle of Tokyo is cut short. She and Ohgi help convince the leaders of the Black Knights that Schneizel`s claims are valid. However, Ohgi adamantly insists that Japan be freed if they betray Zero, feeling that he couldn`t forgive himself if any less came of it. Diethard notes that it is in Ohgi`s nature to protect, not lead, and considers his new leadership role a "miscast." During the battle against Lelouch, he has Villetta stay on Horai Island, telling her that he was the first to acknowledge Lelouch and that he doesn`t want to get new lives involved, as she is pregnant. He marries Villetta at the end of the series, and is elected Prime Minister of Japan.</description>

<name>Tamaki Shin`ichirou</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Tamaki Shin`ichirou is the leader of the second special squadron of the Black Knights. He is hot-headed, carefree and the self-proclaimed best friend of Zero, quick to cheer others on when not doing the fighting but rash and impulsive when he`s on the front lines. His rashness is shown to border on recklessness, as he orders the execution of the Ashford Academy student council against Zero`s wishes, though extenuating circumstances prevent his orders from being carried out. He pilots a standard Knightmare during battles, but is rather inept at that; his frame is the first to be destroyed by Suzaku`s Lancelot in the first season and in all encounters after that, Tamaki is rather comically dispatched very early in battle, which ends up hurting his pride in the end of the second season (the only time Suzaku needs more than one strike to defeat him).
Tamaki dreams of being a bureaucrat, and states that if he didn`t have his dream to aim for, he would probably have become a Refrain user. He is initially skeptical about Zero, but comes to be one of his most vehement supporters, particularly after the Specially Administrated Zone of Japan fails. Even after being captured and imprisoned for a year following the failed Black Rebellion, he never gives up hope that Zero will rescue them, despite the fact that Zero was reported as dead.
Tamaki seems to be the most critical of C.C.`s involvement in the organization during the first season, due to her lack of an official position, and accuses her of being Zero`s lover. In the second season, this appears to have been lightened into simple back and forth banter. Tamaki also complains about his own lack of an official position in the second season (what happened to his old position is not revealed), wanting to be in charge of finances in some way (Lelouch relieved him of this responsibility early in the first season when he spent much of their money on frivolous dinners for recruiting). With the formation of the United Federation of Nations and the Black Knights` appointment as its unified army, Tamaki is made the Internal Cleaning Supporter. When Lelouch is exposed as Zero, Tamaki takes it the hardest, being the last to accept that Zero could have manipulated them all this time. At the end of the series, Tamaki opens his own bistro alongside Sugiyama, Minami, and Villetta and is last seen standing right next to Ohgi in Ohgi and Villetta`s wedding picture.</description>

<description>Cécile Croomy is Lloyd`s subordinate in Camelot and one of the Lancelot`s developers. She is a capable scientist in her own right, having designed the energy wing system used on the Guren Seiten and the Lancelot Albion. Cécile is a kind-hearted woman and a good friend to Suzaku, often helping him with homework. She also acts as Lloyd`s conscience, not hesitating to scold him or physically punish him for his unintentionally rude remarks or treating Suzaku as a "part". Cécile is a capable Knightmare Frame pilot, managing to single-handedly hold the entire contingent of Black Knights sent to occupy Ashford Academy during the Black Rebellion at bay using a Sutherland modified with equipment from the Lancelot. Prior to joining Lloyd in the military, she studied at the Imperial Colchester Institute.[4] Following Lelouch`s ascension to the throne, she follows Lloyd and Suzaku and willingly accepts Lelouch as the new emperor. A recurring joke is that Cécile is a bad cook, though no one has the heart to tell her; her recipes include onigiri mixed with blueberry jam and sandwiches made with ginger, sugar and wasabi.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Diethard Ried is the head of information, espionage, and public relations for the Black Knights. A graduate of the Imperial Britannia Central University`s Faculty of Law, Diethard is a former producer and member of the press staff at Hi-TV, a Britannian television station. Following the appearance of Zero and the announcement of his goals, Diethard joins the Black Knights, wishing to witness and document Zero`s campaign to overthrow Britannia. Like Kallen Stadtfeld, he shows fierce loyalty to Zero, whom he views as his source of inspiration. He harbors contempt for the Britannian Imperial Family and its supporters, on occasion commenting to Rakshata Chawla that "Britannia is a finished product" and that he would rather take part in creating something new.
Diethard has proven himself to be highly perceptive, easily picking up on the likely outcomes of Zero`s plans. He recognizes immediately that Zero is responsible for the destruction of the Japan Liberation Front`s tanker ship, a fact of which Zero never made the organization aware. However, this same trait also causes him to overreach himself, most evident in his ordering an assassination attempt on Suzaku Kururugi after being instructed otherwise by Zero. When Kallen wonders if he can be trusted, Lelouch replies that Diethard is dedicated to making Zero a god, which makes him predictable and thus easy to control.
Despite possessing some knowledge of who Lelouch is and of his power, Diethard remains loyal. Only when Lelouch is exposed in front of the leaders of the Black Knights does he finally betray him. He claims that he would rather have watched Zero topple Britannia, but will settle for a hero`s death instead. When finding Lelouch proves difficult following his escape, Diethard suggests reporting him as dead, noting that even if Zero came back he would have no credibility without support. He defects to Schneizel following this, deciding that Schneizel and his plans are more interesting than Zero`s. When Schneizel is placed under Lelouch`s control, Diethard flies into a rage, holding Lelouch at gunpoint and claiming that Zero`s story is dead. Schneizel shoots him in the heart before he can pull the trigger. In his dying moments, Diethard asks Lelouch to use his Geass to kill him, to which Lelouch responds that Diethard isn`t worthy of having a Geass order cast upon him.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Lloyd Asplund is an earl of the Britannian nobility and the head of the scientific research team Camelot, which is responsible for the development of the elite Knightmare Frame Lancelot. To keep from being reminded of the fragility of human lives and friendship, Lloyd immerses himself in science and comes to view people as nothing more than tools — he regards Suzaku, for example, as a mere component of the machine that he pilots. He has a tendency to mock others and is often rebuked for this behavior by Cécile Croomy, his assistant. Prior to joining the military, he attended the Imperial Colchester Institute.[4] Lloyd`s research organization, Camelot (キャメロット?), is an irregular division of the Britannian Military that has permission from Prince Schneizel to operate outside the command structure and regulations of the regular Britannian armed forces.
Rakshata refers to Lloyd as the Earl of Pudding (プリン伯爵?), as pudding is his favorite food. He is engaged to Milly Ashford in the first season, having agreed to the union mostly in the hope that he might obtain the designs of the Knightmare Frame Ganymede. As such, he is forced into doing nice things for her by Suzaku, though Milly breaks off the engagement after she graduates in order to become more true to herself.
After the second battle of Tokyo, he is confronted by a distraught Nina after she realizes the fatalities caused by her F.L.E.I.J.A. Lloyd tells her that she has to make a choice between saving her heart and morals or discard them for science. When asked by Nina if he had already made that choice, he replies that he never had such a problem due to himself being a sociopath. He willingly joins Lelouch`s new regime, remarking that he and Cécile have become "parts" without ever realizing it. He and Cecile are among the few who know the details of the "Zero Requiem", Lelouch`s plan to unite the world. He expresses an interest in studying Lelouch`s Geass, but he is warned off by Jeremiah. He works with Nina and Cécile to create a countermeasure to F.L.E.I.J.A. and assists Sayoko during the rescue of the hostages on board the Avalon (as ordered by Lelouch). He and Cécile are last seen in Ohgi and Villetta`s wedding picture.</description>

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>The Gawain is a sixth-generation prototype Knightmare Frame developed by Schneizel el Britannia, and is about twice the size of other Knightmare Frames. It is the first Knightmare Frame in the series to feature an integrated float system thus being capable of sustained flight, and features a double-seater cockpit, although it can be operated by a single person. Its fingers are miniature Slash Harkens, and its Hadron Cannons, especially after Rakshata Chawla`s modifications, are devastating long-range weapons. The Gefjun Disturber installed by Rakshata also has the side effect of making the Gawain invisible to radar. The prototype Druid System installed on the Gawain, originally intended to study the Thought Elevators, gives the it the ability to plot the probable movements of enemy units. Despite its rather impressive firepower, it is a comparatively slow unit, and can be easily outpaced by faster Knightmare Frames such as Gloucesters.
The Gawain was stolen by Lelouch and Kallen from Schneizel`s expeditionary force during the incident at Kaminejima island, and later became Lelouch and C.C.`s personal Knightmare Frame.
The Gawain was destroyed when C.C. entangled Jeremiah Gottwald`s Siegfried and sent both of them to the bottom of the ocean. The Hadron Cannons were salvaged and incorporated into the Ikaruga, the Black Knights` flagship, as was the Druid System, which later became a key part of Lelouch`s second personal Knightmare Frame, the Shinkirou.</description>

She is nicknamed "Marianne the Flash" for her piloting skills, having been the test pilot for the Ganymede Knightmare Frame with the support of the Ashford Foundation, which was then a contender in the development of the first Knightmare Frame prototypes. Bismarck Waldstein claims that the only person he had to use his Geass against before Suzaku was Marianne, which shows that she must have been particularly skilled. When Lelouch was a child, she was assassinated within the Aries Palace, purportedly by terrorists, and the culprits were never found. The fact that the impenetrable security of the palace was powerless is what convinced Lelouch that her murder was no random act of terrorism.</description>
