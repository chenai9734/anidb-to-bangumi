<description>The story is set in the early 21st century, in which a covert evil organization Dokuga, led by lord Neo Neros, holds nearly total political, economic and military control of the world. Dokuga agents try to forcibly recruit a brilliant physicist, Professor Sanada, who sets off a suicide bomb rather than let Dokuga acquire his secret research. His son Kenta becomes Dokuga`s next target, but is saved by his father`s colleague and taken on board a teleporting fortress, Good Thunder. Teleportation is enabled by a mysterious form of energy called Beamler, which was discovered by Sanada. The same energy also powers a giant battle robot, GoShogun, which is operated by three pilots. The crew of Good Thunder travels the world, repeatedly fighting off Neo Neros`s forces with GoShogun and often hampering Dokuga`s influence on the local level, whether by destroying their bases and businesses, assisting popular rebellions, or by averting environmental disasters.

<title xml:lang="en">Complete Movie</title>
<summary>Forty years after the events of the TV series, Remy Shimada, ex-pilot of the GoShogun, suffers a terrible accident while on her way to a meeting with her former robot-piloting comrades. While they rush to the hospital, Remy floats between life and death. She sees visions of her life when she was young, and stranger still, experiences a hallucination of being with her friends, all of them young again, in a mysterious city filled with hostile fanatics. Far from being the reunion Remy hoped for, a ghastly letter arrives for each member of the team that predicts their gruesome deaths. Slated to die in two days, both in reality and in her dream, Remy struggles to find a way out of the City of Fate, relying on the memories of her friends to see her through, even as they surround her death bed in the waking world.
