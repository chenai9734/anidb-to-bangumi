<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="317067">Shinkai has done it again, this movie is absolutely gorgeous. A nice little romance story too, although too short.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="271983">The imagery is pure porn, the fluidity of animation, the details in backgrounds, all of it.

But for some reason it didn`t "ring" with me like other Shinkai work. Still, definitely worth the watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="63560">The plot is not what I`m recommending this anime for, it was far too short for that but this was one of the most graphically beautiful anime I`ve ever seen, and well worth watching.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="84998">This is not a romance film in the strict sense of the word. People who won`t be satisfied without a concrete resolution (positive or negative) won`t be missing anything if they skip it, but it`s still an excellent short film.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="458577">If you were able to bore through 5 Centimetres Per Second and The Place Promised in Our Early Days you will love The Garden of Words. It`s picture perfect CGI, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it makes you dream.  What more could you ask for in an anime?  Definitely it won`t bore you regardless of your genre preference.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="41949">[i]Kotonoha no Niwa[/i] is [b]an anime [i]tanka[/i], or short poem, capturing one dewdrop in eternity. 

One imperfect, yet beautiful verse, as opposed to an entire novel.[/b]

This is a contemporary anime reenactment of the sorts of meetings described in the Heian period`s [i]Genji monogatari[/i], the world`s first novel. Meetings during which, via the exchange of tanka -- written in calligraphy, on fans scented by personally-crafted incense, accompanied by an appropriate flower or greenery -- two disembodied sensibilities realize their deep compatibility. `Disembodied`, because such courtships typically took place between two people separated by a folding screen or [i]byōbu[/i]. 

One meeting, out of billions of skew lines:
 
“Love consists in this, that two solitudes protect and touch and greet each other.” 
-- Rainer Maria Rilke</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="78751">While it is easy to review an animated movie based on raw viewing pleasure, these days we fail to appreciate some works because of our anime experiences and we easily base our opinions on the marks of the ones that watched it before us. 
Some may say that Kotonoha no Niwa does not come up to some standards set by other works before it. To them I say: When did you stop enjoying anime for the art that it is?
It is not hard to notice the amount of work put in by Shinkai Makoto and his team in this movie.
So my opinion for those who did not see it? Yes! Get it!, Watch it! Enjoy it!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="158264">Just watched this based on a AniDB recommendation - it is absolutely drop-dead gorgeous. The animation and the colours are brilliant, the story line really keeps you entertained throughout. I was so gutted that I could only experience this for the 40 minutes (which is the length of the movie).</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="567284">Perfection of art design and color design and graphic.You must watch it for its colorful scene and cute theme.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="240447">The animation is simply beautiful.
In equal parts, I was mesmerized by the scenery and hooked to the story.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="1841">Simply Amazing, really got hooked with the scenery  and animation was AWESOME!

A must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="318866">wow, beautiful, the animation is wow</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="561560">Words can’t nearly describe how visually beautiful this movie is. The depth, the colors and the movements are even better than 5 Centimeters. Despite some negative voices, I liked the story and the message. You must know how to walk, before you can run towards each other…</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="60478">I really liked this, was thinking to give 10 but the ending just doen`t satisy me, so it`s 8 and must see anyway.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="57112">This is Shinkai`s best work in my opinion. Even better than 5 Centimeters Per Second and his latest film, Your Name. Where it succeeds is in its honest and realistic plot and characters. It doesn`t rely on sci-fi or supernatural aspects like his other films and that helps keep the plot grounded and human. The way he captures romance, growth, and feelings of identity and self-worth is simply phenomenal. The artwork and animation are unbelievable and in a league of their own, a cut above anything else in the industry. Also, Shinkai managed to make the characters look interesting and realistic, something that he usually struggles with. And to top it off, the music is great. There`s pretty much nothing to flaw in this movie except its length. But for a quick watch, you won`t find much better than this.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="442699">Once again , an amazing movies from Makoto Shinkai</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="571059">Animation is some of the best I`ve ever seen. I wasn`t bored for a second while watching it because the story is very well paced and written. A must watch for anyone who can spare 45 minutes.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="612872">Simply mindblowing art as expected and the story this time is less tragic (good for some peaple)

but i reall wanted to see more in the ending (not satisfying enough)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="597887">American movies don`t even come close to Anime movies like these, and this was all told in about 45 min. This movie is one of the top 3 Romance Anime movie list. I rate this a 9.75/10</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="312729">It was excellent to see Shinkai Makoto back on top form, this was on par (if not better) than 5cm per second. Worth 45 minutes of anyones time!</recommendation>

<description>We have met, for each of us to walk forward.
http://anidb.net/ch53043 [Takao], who is training to become a shoemaker, skipped school and is sketching shoes in a Japanese-style garden. He meets a mysterious woman, http://anidb.net/ch53044 [Yukino], who is older than him. Then, without arranging the times, the two start to see each other again and again, but only on rainy days. They deepen their relationship and open up to each other. But the end of the rainy season soon approaches...

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>melodrama</name>
<description>A melodrama is a dramatic work that exaggerates plot and characters in order to appeal to the emotions, often with strongly stereotyped characters. Language, behaviour, or events which resemble melodramas are also called melodramatic. In scholarly and historical musical contexts melodramas are dramas of the 18th and 19th centuries in which orchestral music or song was used to accompany the action.
Melodrama is a style of drama that has been applied on the stage, in movies and television, and radio formats, from the 18th century to the present. Because of the long timeframe in which the style has existed, it is difficult to derive a precise definition. The term melodrama is most often used pejoratively, to suggest that the work to which the term is applied lacks sophistication or subtlety.
The term originated from the early 19th-century French word mélodrame, which is derived from Greek melos, music, and French drame, drama (from Late Latin drāma, which in turn derives from Greek drān, to do, perform).

<name>age difference romance</name>
<description>A romance between individuals of significantly different ages is featured. Depending on how big the age gap is and on the society featured, that may be considered taboo.
While the terms "lolicon" and "shotacon", often used in relation to anime and its fandom, are limited to a physical or erotic attraction to sexually precocious girls or boys respectively, this tag expands into platonic romances and other age ranges.</description>

<name>season</name>
<description>A season is a division of the year, marked by changes in weather, ecology, and hours of daylight. Seasons result from the yearly orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth`s rotational axis relative to the plane of the orbit. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth`s surface, variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.
During May, June, and July, the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun. The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December, January, and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere.
In temperate and subpolar regions, four calendar-based seasons (with their adjectives) are generally recognized: spring (vernal), summer (estival), autumn (autumnal), fall and winter (hibernal). Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring (prevernal) and late summer (serotinal) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four.
