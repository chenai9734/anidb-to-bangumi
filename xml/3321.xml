<name>bounty hunter</name>
<description>A bounty hunter is one who hunts and captures targets (be it people, animals, etc.) for monetary gain, preferably without killing/destroying their target. Despite being illegal in most of the world today, it is a legal profession in the United States and Philippines (a former commonwealth of the US), who are known as "bail enforcement agents".
If they are only and constantly hired to kill, they are likely an http://anidb.net/t2399 [assassin].

<name>content indicators</name>
<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>parallel world</name>
<description>A parallel world, parallel universe, or alternative reality is a self-contained separate reality coexisting with our own. Because "alternative reality" sometimes implies that the reality is a variant of our own, like for example a mirror world, we use the term "parallel world/universe" which is more general, without any connotations implying a relationship (or lack thereof) with our own world/universe (meaning a fictional world can just as well have an alternative reality, it doesn`t need to be our reality). To put it more simply, this category is to show if more than 1 world/universe/reality is present in the anime.
Multiple timelines of the same world/universe/reality are NOT considered parallel worlds. For example, in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate] the cast travels through multiple "World Lines", which are defined as parallel timelines of the same universe had various events occurred with differing outcomes.</description>

The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top".</description>

<name>Train Heartnet</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Train Heartnet also known as "Black Cat", is a sweeper partnered with Sven. Train is a lighthearted, courageous man who`s highly skilled with a gun. He seems to enjoy tormenting Sven and tightening their already small budget as low-paid sweepers by his exaggerated food consumption. Some of Train`s distinguishing features are his spiky brown ruffled hair, his catlike slitted eyes, a choker with a tiny bell attached to it, and the XIII tattoo he has on his chest.</description>

<name>Saya Minatsuki</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Saya Minatsuki is an accomplished sweeper, whose fun loving spirit and easy likeability allows her to form a friendship with Train. Her involvement with him leads to his more human outlook on life and his departure from Chronos.
She is killed by Creed, who believes that Train`s personality change is a curse due to her. Before dying, she tells Train to "forget about her", which causes him to struggle while deciding to get revenge on Creed or not. Her "spirit" lives on, often guiding Train and his friends and giving them strength.
Saya has no memories of her life before the age of ten, due to heavy abuse from her parents. Her first real memory is waking up in hospital and being carried off to a relative`s house. She constantly feels alone until becoming a sweeper, which best suits her personality and way of thinking. She constantly wears a yukata, though it is strange to others, just because she thinks she looks cute in it. She develops the "Reflect Shot" over the course of five years. It allows her to fire bullets that ricochet off hard surfaces and strike opponents at odd angles and different velocities. It requires heavy marksmanship experience and a great deal of projectile calculation.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Creed Diskenth is the leader of the group and a former member of Chronos. He greatly admires the assassin side of Train, as the only person in the world he can relate his personality.
After Train changes during his meetings with Saya, Creed kills Saya, and makes it his goal to return Train to his previous lifestyle and have him join the Apostles. He tells the group that their only purpose is destroy Chronos, but he really plans to make himself immortal using nanomachines and rule the world forever by selectivity controlling the human population. He is severely warped after being abused by his mother, whom he kills, and the police while living on the streets.Creed uses his Tao powers to manipulate the hilt of his former sword, "Kotetsu", to form the "Imagine Blade." It`s first form, Level 1, is an invisible sword that is able to extend up to eighty meters. It later evolves into Level 2, a living black sword with a mouth that is directly linked with Creed`s mind. It is able to extend and be manipulated like a whip at will, and it can bite opponents. Level 3 merges the sword with his arm, and another large arm extends from it, which can be used to propel Creed at high speeds. Its final form, Level MAX, creates an extremely large blade made out of light. After obtaining the God`s Breath nanomachines, he becomes able to regenerate from any fatal wound in seconds and he will remain in his peak physical condition forever. Their only weakness is that they cannot fully restore the brain, which would leave him with only primal instincts.</description>

<description>Belze Rochefort in the manga
Belze is the Chronos Numbers member Number II. Sephiria has trusted him since Train left the Chronos Numbers. His weapon is a spear named "Gungnir." While Belze is Sephiria`s right hand man and second in command of the Numbers, it is worth noting that the rest of the Numbers` hierarchy don`t seem to follow a strict order. It has been stated in Belze`s profile page from the manga though that the Number I represents Commanding Officer and II represents Vice Commander.
Belze Rochefort in the anime
There is no noted difference between Belze in the anime and in the manga, except he didn`t battle Kyoko or Charden.</description>

<name>Sephiria Arks</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Sephiria Arks in the manga
Number I. Her weapon is `Christ,` an extremely sharp sabre made of Orichalcum (Orichalcon) that is incredibly strong. Despite her gentle looks and young age, her swordsmanship is such that she can attack extremely rapidly and precisely, not even producing sound when her sword makes a cut. She can also move with such speed as to create after-images to confuse opponents. She is young but very charismatic, and genuinely cares for life. She can also see through a person`s soul, it is said, as she can guess exactly a person`s feelings. As a result of that skill, she often manipulates others, such as Train Heartnet. While she can be cruel and hurtful in her ambition, she is not a mean-spirited person. No matter if it`s a friend or a foe, she hates seeing anyone sacrificed - though in a battle with Creed Diskenth, she would have given up her own life (via an explosive bracelet) to destroy Creed, if Train hadn`t intervened. In the final tankouban of Black Cat, she mentions that her body possesses an enhanced recovery time because she was "born to live for Chronos" and "wouldn`t die so easily". She is also a master swordsman, knowing all thirty-six moves of her style, the ultimate being `Apocalypse` which completely reduces a target to nothing.
Sephiria Arks in the anime
Sephiria holds much animosity towards Train for leaving Chrono, and is generally more aggressive than her Manga counter-part. Her appearance looks younger as well, and she seems to be near Train`s age. Her manipulativeness is also played down in the Anime, and she is more forthright than sneaky. She decides to help Train in fighting Eden to rescue Eve when Train defiles her pride. In these battles she demonstrates her superior fighting abilities. At the end of the Anime, she leaves to rebuild Chronos from scratch.</description>

<name>Lin Xiao Li</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>In the Anime, Lin did not appear until the Sweeper Alliance, and his role was different: He merely summoned the sweepers and granted them a place in the trip to Clarken Island instantaneously. He also attempted to persuade Train into rejoining Chronos once his identity had been revealed, a scene which occurred in the anime (Ep 17). He also shows a "darker" personality in the Anime, as in the manga he was an innocent Number who admired Train and just wanted to fight for world peace, but in the Anime his admiring for Train is more directed to "admiring his power", and he has no problems in offending the sweepers many times. He also accuses them of fighting without receiving nothing in return, which makes him sound a bit materialistic. But it seems his personality evolves as he shows a more sympathic side, which appears to start when he says, precisely, that sweepers are idiots for fighting without getting anything in return, but after a chat with Train, when they`re helping townsfolk, Train asks him if he isn`t one of those fools, and he answers smiling "You might be right".</description>

<description>Even though on the Manga he shows a friendly alignment to Train and Sven`s sweeper team, in the anime, he shows a neutral attitude at the start, mainly because Eve was his target once, saved by Train. However, he develops a supporting attitude towards Train`s group as of the Eden incursion. He also has a different role, as he partakes in many missions he did not in the manga. For example, he watches the World Conference in a helicopter and is also given the mission of taking out Eve or take her to the Chronos headquarters at the start. In the Anime, he also is always accompanied by a Chronos eraser, that aids him. His relation with Lin is not of old acquaintances, as it is more strict and formal. Also, it would seem his feelings towards Rinslet are of love, even though it`s not known if he`s just a flirt.He always finds opportunity to express his feelings to Rinslet at tight situations even though they are just words. However, they are closer than they are in the Manga. In the last episode, Rinslet is talking on the phone with him.</description>
