<description>Kakomareta Sekai is a short animation done by http://anidb.net/cr445 [Shinkai Makoto] using Lightwave 3D. It is inspired by Japanese novelist Murakami Haruki`s book `Sekai no Owari to Hard-Boiled Wonderland` (English title: Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World). The music was done by http://anidb.net/cr3546 [Tenmon], who`s also responsible for the music in Shinkai`s `Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko`, `Hoshi no Koe`, and `Kumo no Mukou, Yakusoku no Basho`.
Only 30 seconds long, this short was originally viewable at Shinkai`s website, but has since been taken down due to bandwidth issues. Its chances of getting a proper release are slim, as Shinkai intended it only as practice using 3DCG programs.</description>

<name>CGI</name>
<description>Computer-generated imagery (CGI) or computer animation is the art of creating moving images via the use of computers. It is a subfield of computer graphics and animation. Increasingly it is created by means of 3D computer graphics, though 2D computer graphics are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time rendering needs. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another medium, such as film.</description>

<name>short movie</name>
<description>Typically used when an OVA only has one part and is less than the usual 20 to 25 minutes in length.
So instead of calling it a `short episode`, the `short movie` tag is more appropriate.</description>

<name>3D CG animation</name>
<description>Abbreviation for "three-dimensional computer generated animation" or "computer graphics" (CGI). The traditional 2D art is enhanced by 3D imagery developed through computer modeling software. Done in the right way, this union of 3D in a 2D animated world can be a very beautiful relationship.
The difference lies in what lacks the traditional 2D animation all together and may give term to something produced entirely with 3D graphics (such as the 2006 remake of "Appleseed" , 2007`s "Vexille", the 2008 addition to the "Biohazard" series and the more well known "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within" and "Advent Children").</description>
