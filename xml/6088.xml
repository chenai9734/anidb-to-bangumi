<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="77536">It have a very good start point, but they rush it to the end, and there is not enough plot.

we already seen better shows like mr.robot or tokyo ghoul so this anime is only for people who need a little bit more of them.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="167028">It has one of the most annoying protagonist I have ever come across, which overshadows whatever intriguing elements the show has left.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="317942">Pretty enjoyable story along similar veins to the other ";" shows. Based on pseudo science and harems. While Takumi is a bit of an annoying protagonist it is not enough to make the story bad. A good, solid watch</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="322738">Fun ride. Layer upon layer of story.  Kinda scary for those (me) who spends a lot of time on the computer... ;-)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="281330">Hmm what can i say,it was one of a kind and somehow iritating but it caught me till the end...</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="309899">1st full anime ive seen in 720p on my tv and was quite impressed with this anime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="235338">A very nice anime with a good ending.. very worth watching it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="562474">This show is clearly underrated. It might not make a lot of sense for people who don`t understand about E-M wave and a little bit about neurology, but it has more than just science. It`s about ethics and what it means to be humans. Well, I admit the protagonist is among the most annoying and pathetic characters. His harem makes up for his pathetic side, though. If you are a fan of sci-fi and supernaturalism, this show is a must watch one.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="24572">I started on Chaos;Head years ago, picked it up now before trying Chaos;Child. A promising start, a somewhat handsome hikkomori MC (like NHK) stuck in a container flat with his 2d world. 

The plot is intriguing with lots of twists, reminded me about Lain more than S;G or R;N. Mysterious, very confusing at times. Beware, a lot of angst so be up for MC in despair! It was a bit annoying for a while. Great unique characters, less stereotyped than nowadays tsunderes and yanderes. They evolve throughout the show and are all having some part in the plotline.

The animation itself is surely outdated and lackluster now, still it is quite vivid (No Fate-series battle scenes tho!) and fitting to the story. It is a good watch IMO.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="219832">This anime is best anime i have ever seen , u wont regret watching this great anime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="433379">This one is a blast!! So dark mood, thought-provoking, awesome characters and deep plot make this a show you will remember a long time.
To me, Takumi (The main character) is one of my favourite protagonist. The anime follows the visual novel really quite good, but don`t hesitate to take a look on visual if you find some missing parts!</recommendation>

<description>* Based on a visual novel developed by http://anidb.net/cr1334 [5bp] and http://anidb.net/cr1354 [Nitroplus] for the PC.
http://anidb.net/ch1140 [Takumi], a troubled young man, struggles to distinguish reality from his delusions, while being pursued by the perpetrator of a series of bloody murders — or so he believes. His travels take him in and around Shibuya, Tokyo and his adventures bring him in contact with various scientific themes such as the concepts of matter, antimatter, and the Dirac sea.</description>

<name>detective</name>
<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>The two terms are similar yet different, however, the fact that they look and `feel` the same outweighs the technical differences. For clarification, visual novels are considered a sub-genre of adventure games and the term does not cover simulations. While the two genres often share a common visual presentation, dating sims are sometimes considered to be more statistically based than the "choose your own adventure" style of visual novels; basically, the choices you make might change something else than just the story arc (or your next porn pic). Dating sims can involve several technical elements such as a time limit, several statistics such as looks and charm which can be boosted through exercise, or an "attraction meter" which can increase or decrease depending on one`s decisions.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<description>The antics of the protagonists do not take place in some exotic setting or time, but in everyday life. When not "at the job" this means getting up in the morning, making meals, house cleaning, going shopping or out to eat, visiting the bath house or spa, leisure activities in the spare time, etc. The time "on the job" for students is School Life, for others working in their profession. Daily Life is basically a synonym for everything normal, repetitive, and trivial happening to your average person.</description>

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

As his interests in anime, manga, and games are very similar to http://anidb.net/ch1140 [Takumi]`s, the two get along very well, although later his frequent use of the "Whose eyes are those eyes?" phrase seriously bothers http://anidb.net/ch1140 [Takumi].</description>

<summary>Under an overcast, rainy sky, a blue-haired high school boy lies among the shattered ruins of a city, and a pink-haired high school girl appears, wielding a large bladed weapon, who kneels beside him and kisses him while resting the point of her weapon on his chest. Nishijou Takumi is a very reclusive person who lives in a storage container; he is not interested in the real world and suffers from a delusion with Seira Orgel, his favorite anime character. His friend Misumi tells him about a series of incidents called the New Generation events. Takumi chats with a person named Shogun who shows him a barrage of image links depicting a murder of a man being hung by stakes. Horrified, he goes to an internet café to ease his mind. After, he walks into a dark alley and is horrified to watch the murder he saw online; only it is real and happening in front in his eyes. He also sees a pink-haired schoolgirl covered in blood wearing his school`s uniform standing right next to the bloody scene. She then calls out his name. He runs away while unintentionally carrying one of the stakes. The next day, he feels someone is stalking him and finds it was a girl named Kusunoki Yua. She tells him that she too is a fan of Seira. After some initial reluctance, he finally agrees to accompany her to pre-order the latest Seira figurine. The next day, he is shocked to find the pink-haired girl sitting next to him.

<summary>Takumi believes the girl is here to kill him, but the girl laughs it off having no idea what he is talking about. After looking into her eyes, he remembers her name as Sakihata Rimi. At first he is confused, but then Misumi Daisuke says that the three of them have been friends since the first year. While at home he is surprised to find Rimi checking up on him. Takumi freaks out and orders her to get out. At the same time, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department Criminal Investigation Division have found surveillance footage who they believe is a suspect of the murdered staked man. Takumi accompanies Yua to pre-order the latest Seira figurine. As they interact more with each other, Takumi takes a liking to Yua as she accepts him for who he is. Yua accidentally spills out the contents of her handbag. Takumi then realizes that she has been conducting a lot of research on the New Generation murder incidents all along. Takumi, who is frightened with delusional thoughts, attempts to run. She confronts him about what he is hiding by pulling out one of the cross-shaped stakes he had taken from the murder scene. Despite her suddenly threatening nature, she claims that she only wanted to ascertain if he knew about it. She also states that she is curious about whether or not Takumi has the power of precognition. Her reasoning behind this are the images of the third New Generation incident that were sent to Takumi. Takumi claims that he got them from someone called Shogun and wonders if Yua is that person. Yua, however, explains that the images were found on the computer he was using at the internet cafe. Yua concludes that Takumi is Shogun. Nevertheless, she lets him go, and Takumi returns home playing his MMORPG.

<summary>A flashback shows when Takumi was a little boy. He is upset for having not gone on a school field trip, so he wished that no one could go. He drew a picture of a school bus and then he ripped it in half. His mother then receives a call informing her that on the way to the field trip the bus got in an accident and was ripped in half. Takumi thought his wish came true. For days he was speechless, in which his mother promptly took him to a psychiatrist. In present time, Takumi goes to the hospital to see Takashi Fumio, his childhood psychiatrist, accompanied by Hazuki, his nurse. He claims that he is sleepwalking so they have him sleep for three hours to see if he gets up. Hazuki says that he was not sleepwalking and so Takumi goes home. Rimi goes to the library and meets a strange student. Back at home, Takumi receives an image of him running from the murder while holding a stake. He believes that Shogun took a picture of the future. Daisuke brings Takumi to a live concert to see the band, called Phantasm, and their lead singer, stage-named FES. Takumi notices that FES is looking at him and hallucinates that she is walking towards him with a sword. Takumi leaves the concert early and the scene goes to a girl and her mother preparing to move to a new house. Nanami takes Takumi to go buy him a cell phone and then they go eat. There, Takumi notices a girl with a sword similar to that of FES. At home Takumi goes on the chat room and clicks on a link that entitles the fourth New Generation incident, which then leads to an auction called "Vampire".

<summary>After the earthquake, Takumi searches for Rimi at school. Ayase jumps off the school roof, but Takumi unwittingly creates a flowerbed to save her from the fall. Later, nasty rumors begin to circulate around the school that it was Takumi`s relationship with Ayase that caused her to jump. As his class is teasing him, a feminine voice begins speaking to Takumi in his head. After school, Takumi gets beat up by a group of paid thugs, but is saved by Kozue who is apparently able to communicate telepathically. She is revealed to be another Di-Sword wielder as well as a friend of Sena Aoi, the girl that Takumi met in the streets a few days ago. Sena explains that people who are able to see and obtain Di-Swords are called "Gigalomaniacs", and that they are capable of projecting their delusions to other people, with the help of their Di-Swords. The Nozomi Technology Group has a meeting and it is revealed that they are using a machine called Noah II to synthetically use the powers of the Gigalomaniacs for their own purpose. To this end, they have recruited several people, called "Porters" who carry special devices in backpacks to allow Noah II`s signal to reach people. The backpack device destroyed by Sena in the previous episode is revealed to be one such mobile transmitter port for Noah II`s signals. Takumi learns that he, Sena and Kozue are all Gigalomaniacs with the power to project delusions into reality, using a process called "real-booting". Takumi is said to be special in that he is unknowingly capable of real-booting delusions even without a Di-Sword. When a Noah II created delusion of a runaway digger appears and cause people to panic, Sena and Kozue jump into action to destroy the mobile transmitters carried in backpacks by the Porters nearby. The Nozomi Technology Group vows to remove all obstacles to their plans. Takumi, Sena, and Kozue form a group to stop Nozomi, and Kozue urges that they take a commemorative picture in a nearby photo booth.

<summary>Takumi is still waiting for Rimi to show up in school. She has not appeared in school since the day of the earthquake. Kozue comes to ask Takumi to accompany them to attack the headquarters of the Nozomi Technology Group to destroy Noah II. Takumi refuses so Kozue starts crying to force him to join them. He then takes her outside the school to avoid troublesome rumors. Sena was waiting for them outside and convinces him to join them. They entered through the front of the building and reached the underground research facility with the help of Sena who projected a delusion that caused the people around them to see the trio as corporate executives. Meanwhile, Rimi is shown in a hospital room talking to an old man in a wheelchair, shown as Shogun, who Takumi saw previously in the streets of Shibuya. The trio apparently finds Noah II but Genichi Norose, the president of the Nozomi Technology Group appears to stop them. Takumi sees visions of Sena`s past and that her real name is Hatano Sena and not Aoi Sena. When they were about to lose, Ayase suddenly appears and helps them. She then collapses after the fight. Norose was frozen due to Ayase`s projection of her delusion but he makes Sena and Kozue fight each other by causing them to see delusions that made them think the other is Norose. Takumi unconsciously cancels the delusions Sena and Kozue were seeing. Sena apparently defeats Norose and Kozue destroys Noah II. They then find out that it was not Noah II, but just a prototype machine and that the Norose they defeated was simply a delusion real-booted by that machine. Takumi goes to school the next day and is overjoyed to see Rimi. Norose is shown in a dark office in a high building talking to someone, apparently another Gigalomaniac, who is trapped and held up in his massive Di-Sword.

<summary>Yua is shown in Momose`s private investigator office talking to Ban about the New Generation incidents and Takumi, while Ban asks her if she is the twin sister of Kusunoki Mia, who is one of the five victims of the "Group Dive". Ban receives a call from Mamoru saying the sixth New Gen incident has occurred. Takumi also finds out about the sixth incident from the internet through his online friend Grim, who identifies it as "Brainless". The victims were the thugs who attacked Takumi previously. He believes that Shogun is deliberately targeting him. Going through old stuff stored in boxes to find clues, he comes across an old essay of his entitled "Those eyes... Whose are they?" with a scribbling written in the back including a formula, "Ir2", on it. He then receives a cryptic call from Nanami asking for his help. Meanwhile, Yua tells Ban about Ayase`s Di-Sword. Ban replies with him seeing Sena in a security camera video pulling out a Di-Sword out of nowhere. Momose, sitting next to Ban, changes the topic and asks about the frog plushies hanging from Yua`s handbag, while Yua tells them they are currently trendy and that new designs come out on the weekends with long lines of people waiting to buy them. Takumi, Rimi, and Daisuke go to visit Ayase in the hospital. Rimi tells the two of them to go ahead and excuses herself. She is later spotted by the two having an argument with Ayase. Ayase, back in her room, tells Takumi that overcoming his "divine punishment" trial would enable him to obtain his Di-Sword. Ayase then tells him about her own ordeal. Later, Takumi receives another call from Nanami asking for his help. He returns to his container house with Rimi and finds Sena and Kozue waiting for him on top of it. Sena asks him if he was the one who drew the scribble with the "Ir2" equation on it, and when Takumi confirms, Sena jumps down to attack him with her Di-Sword. Rimi pulls him away and summons her own Di-Sword to block Sena`s attacks. Sena goes past Rimi using a feint attack and moves to attack Takumi, then Rimi stops her by forcing her to see a delusion involving a certain homeless man from her past. After Sena stops attacking, Takumi asks her about "Ir2". Sena blames him because that equation is what led to the destruction of her family. She tells him that the chaos in Shibuya right now originated from that equation. Kozue, who was simply watching from the sidelines, mentions seeing a homeless man telling her that the boy who started "Those eyes... Whose are they?" is the most important. Sena then leaves to find that man. Takumi thanks Rimi for saving his life. On the way to the his childhood house, Rimi warns Takumi that things will not remain the same if he goes and tries to discourage him from going. Takumi tells her that he has to see Nanami. When Takumi reaches the place where his childhood home was supposed to be, he is shocked to see unfamiliar scenery instead, and Rimi tells him that he has nowhere in the world to go home to. Elsewhere, Shogun is shown entering a hidden hospital room. The name of the patient ironically written outside the room is Nishijou Takumi.

<summary>In a dreamlike inner monologue sequence, Shogun explains that he is suffering from an illness that caused his body to age rapidly after ten years, nearing his death. When Takumi queries what will happen once Shogun dies, to which the latter responds that the former will continue to exist after being real-booted. Even if Takumi dies instead, Shogun will have his life span extended, albeit for only a few days or weeks. Along the way to the Noah II planetarium, Takumi is attacked by several real-booted Seira dolls created by Noah II, with the objective of stopping him. Elsewhere, Shogun, tells Nanami, Ayase, and Yua to catch up and assist Takumi in destroying Noah II. The three of them meet up with Sena and Kozue at the underground subway station and they all go together to help Takumi. Inside the old planetarium, Takumi discovers Rimi being held up on Norose`s Di-Sword. Rimi is surprised by his arrival, and Takumi responds by declaring his love for her and that he has come to save her. Norose explains his philosophy then removes Rimi from his sword to fight Takumi. Noah II activates its defense mechanism to protect itself. Taku is then overwhelmed by a series of delusions that causes him to stop moving in reality. Rimi snaps him out of the delusions and he continues to fight Norose in a losing battle. Nanami, Yua, Ayase, Sena, and Kozue arrive at a spot below the building where they decide to assist Takumi by sending him their powers via Ayase`s Cocytus delusion using the water from the city`s underground river. With the help of Takumi`s final power and encouragement from all six girls, Taku confirms his existence and defeats another delusion. Taku becomes impervious to physical attacks by Norose. Ayase`s Cocytus arrives and freezes Norose in place while Taku receives power from the girls, including the last from Rimi. He then creates a special attack with his Di-Sword and throws it at Norose as the target with Noah II behind him. The scene returns to the very first scene of the story, where under a rainy, overcast sky, Taku lies among the ruins of Shibuya with Rimi kneeling beside him, kissing him before she goes to plunge her Di-Sword into his chest. However, she is unable to bring herself to kill him because of her strong feelings for him. Shogun tells Takumi to live on in his place before he passes away. Takumi, inheriting memories of Shogun, consoles Rimi with the exact words with which the real Takumi used to comfort her. Holding hands, Takumi and Rimi then return the sky to its original color, and with the appearance of Nanami, Yua, Ayase, Sena, and Kozue, the city is restored to its original form.
