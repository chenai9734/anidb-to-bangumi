<description>Recap: "When a mysterious little animal, http://anidb.net/ch8332 [Pokota], came into our lives, things began to get complicated. I, http://anidb.net/ch1000 [Lina Inverse], and my self-proclaimed bodyguard http://anidb.net/ch7616 [Gourry], where caught up in Pokota`s crusade to save his home country of Taforashia. It started with an attempt to charge me with the crime of... get this... being Lina Inverse. And after that things just went downhill. We were attacked by an assassin and a stubby Marquette, and then dragged into a fight against a legendary evil monster that had been revived once again. Really, this is getting to be too much! Fortunately even legendary monsters are no match for Lina Inverse, or so I thought. There are still way too many riddles to solve. Who knows what will happen next." — from intro
To find a way in rescuing Pokota`s country, Taforashia, which was sealed by http://anidb.net/ch7716 [Rezo] after being hit by a deadly disease, Lina and her group are in search for the http://anidb.net/ch7887 [Hellmaster]`s jar in which the http://anidb.net/ch7724 [Red Priest] placed his soul after death.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>adventure</name>
<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Lina Inverse is the primary protagonist and the only character appearing in the whole Slayers-franchise. She is an adolescent but very powerful sorceress, with a great love for money, treasure and food. In the anime and manga (but not in the light novel) Lina uses overly destructive magic recklessly, often with little provocation. She is reputed to be an evil, powerful, destructive, diminutive sorceress (the evil part is arguably not true, though one may consider her greed and general lack of concern for others unless they are in danger of being killed can be considered "evil").
Lina has gained many different nicknames, including "Bandit Killer" and "Dragon Spooker", neither of which she`s very fond of, though to her, her most embarrassing nickname is "Lina the Pink" which is her official title amongst the sorcerer`s guild.</description>

<description>Xellos is a mazoku and the priest of Greater Beast Zelas Metallium.
Xellos was created by Zelas during the Kouma War. The mazoku put a barrier over the peninsula and managed keep the enemy`s reinforcements out of the battle. Because of this, however, four of the five lords were unable to participate in the war anymore, so priests and generals were created in order to represent them. Because he is her only immediate servant, and he was created from a great deal of her power, Xellos is more powerful than all the other priests and generals of Ruby Eye Shabranigdu`s subordinates.
In the Kouma War, Xellos single-handedly killed thousands of golden dragons; he is feared and hated by them ever since. They refer to him as the Dragon Slayer, although he does not like this name, probably because it does not fit the "image" he wants others to view him as. After the war, before serving Hellmaster, Xelloss`s duty for a thousand years was to find stray copies of the Claire Bible and destroy them so that humans could not find an easy way to defeat mazoku (with Zanaffar), or utilise the power of the Lord of Nightmares.
Xelloss` true astral form is that of a simple black cone. He is able to divide his power into dozens of tiny cones that can inflict damage over a long period of time.</description>

<description>When Lina Inverse destroyed the Dragon no Kiba (Dragon`s Fang) gang, and was later encountered by a small array of vengeful bandits, Gourry Gabriev jumped in to save her. Though Lina appreciated the offer, she initially opted against accepting Gourry as a bodyguard, but Gourry`s big-brotherly nature prevented him from acting otherwise. Gourry, dense as a brick, saw Lina as a younger girl in need of protection, and thus, he offered it.
Gourry is the owner of the most powerful sword known to man, the mysterious Sword of Light. The Sword of Light channels its users intentions into energy, usually taking the form of a gleaming blade of light. Gourry has learned how to utilize the sword`s energy in different forms, though, most notably the power of swinging it quickly downwards to form energy beam projectiles.
Gourry is the swordsman of the group, and acts the role very well. He`s single-minded in his protection of Lina, and even after helping Lina defeat Ruby-Eye Shabranigdu, he has resolved to follow Lina around wherever she goes. Supposedly, he has nothing better to do, and perhaps still sees himself as her guardian.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>When Lina Inverse overthrew the Dragon`s Fang bandit gang, one of Zelgadiss` men, Zolf, happened to be stuck inside. And, well, he got incinerated. Needless to say, Zelgadiss was mad. More importantly, though, Lina had gotten a very valuable Orihalcon statue, which was the reason Zolf was there to begin with. Zelgadiss wanted the statue in hopes that it could cure his chimaeric curse.
Only, it didn`t quite work out that way. Zelgadiss didn`t quite cure himself, even after the whole incident with Rezo, the Red Priest and Ruby-Eye Shabranigdu. So, he`s still searching for a cure, hoping to find one of the fabled Clair-Bibles in hopes to cure himself. The curse makes him 1/3 golem, 1/3 demon, and 1/3 human, which makes him impervious to most physical weapon such as swords and buckshot, but not to the physical impact of, say, a cannonball.
Zelgadiss is quite self-conscious about his appearance, almost ashamed of it. In fact, he`s a very quiet character all around, only speaking when necessary, and only interested in the shortest path to his cure. He also tends to get embarassed easily wherever the topic of romance is brought up.
Zelgadiss is a superb swordsman, having trained many long years. He often enhances his blade with the Astral Vine spell, one of many Shamanist spells at his disposal. He has more or less mastered the Spirit category of Shamanism, having learned its most powerful spell, the Ra-Tilt, among numerous other spells in other categories.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Amelia is the daughter of Philionel el de Seyruun, Crown Prince of the kingdom of Seyruun. Like her father, Amelia is a self-proclaimed Champion of Justice(tm) and is singleminded in her quest for truth, honor, and dignity. Also like her father, she`s a complete klutz and has no clue of what IS and ISN`T a true cause for justice.
Amelia has trained since birth for her cause; once convinced, she isn`t easily dissuaded from inflicting her particular flavor of justice on whoever she perceives to be an "enemy of the people". She thinks of Lina as a hero - a destructive hero, but nevertheless a hero - and wants to be just like her and every other good hero that comes along.
Amelia gets bored being royalty sometimes - she often follows her father Phil on journeys around the countryside. She often looks for trouble, simply so that she can right it. Whenever scouting out an area, she always includes a quick look for the highest place to stand.
...
Why does she always look for the highest place to stand, you ask? In case the enemy strikes, she wants to be able to strike back with a dynamic, triumphant pose of her own, terrifying the enemy with fear of justice. A lot of times, she ends up falling, too, she`s only a young girl after all. In fact, Amelia has the reputation of being one of the clumsiest characters in all of Slayers, topped only by Martina.
Amelia is also a budding sorcerer in her own right. Her specialty is white magic, however she also has reached the highest level of training in Shamanist Spirit magic, a testament to her quick learning time and eagerness to learn. She has even developed a spell or two of her own, most notably the Visfarank spell, which seems to be the glowing manifestation of justice as a pair of boxing gloves.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Phil is the Crown Prince of Seyruun, and presumably the only one trusted to take the throne after numerous assassination attempts. Phil, like his daughter, is dominated by his thirst for justice, so much that he has dedicated his life to being a pacifist. Or at least that`s what he says, he acts more like a pro wrestler sometimes.
Unlike most of the Seyruun royal family, Phil has no magical powers, but he does have a lot of brute strength. He uses this mostly in the form of oxymoronic, justice-themed physical attacks, such as "Pacifist Crush", "Kindness to All Creatures Kick", "Benevolent Giant Swing", and "Goodwill Towards Man Smash". His sheer brute strength is even enough to destroy lesser demons.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Sylphiel Nels Lahda is the daughter of Eruk, one of the nobles of Sairaag. Not too much is known about her, strangely; she just seems to show up in the oddest of places.
Sylphiel plays her role in society well - she has a very dignified manner of speaking. She is also a very kind soul, altruistic in a way. She has no wish to see any undeserving person harmed, and has dedicated her life to that cause. She has reached what many would perceive to be the highest point of White Magic, having learned the potent spells of "Resurrection" and an insanely powerful variant of "Recovery".
However, Sylphiel can`t cast any other magic worth squat, it seems. Shamanist Fire magic is almost completely beyond her grasp; it seems that she might lack the drive to even be capable of causing destruction. Then again, she can if she wants to - she knows a very powerful Black Magic spell, the "Dragu-Slave". In fact, she learned it simply by watching Lina cast it.</description>

<description>The second piece awakened recently in Red Priest Rezo, a great sorcerer and priest. Rezo was blind, and nothing he or anyone else tried could cure his blindness, even though he was able to cure the blindness of others. Eventually, Ruby Eye began having more and more influence over Rezo`s soul, forcing the sorcerer to seek out the Philosopher`s Stone, which would give Ruby Eye the strength to be fully reborn. He succeeded (Rezo swallowed the stone), but was shortly thereafter defeated by Lina Inverse using Giga Slave and the Sword of Light.</description>

<name>Gracia Ul Naga Seyruun</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Naga the White Serpent is the self-proclaimed rival and companion of Lina Inverse.
Naga`s real full name is Gracia Ul Naga Seyruun, making her the first daughter of Crown Prince Philionel El Di Seyruun and the older sister of Amelia Wil Tesla Seyruun.
Naga is very skilled in white magic, no doubt because of where she grew up. Lina is often surprised when Naga uses these spells, because Naga does not seem like the kind of person to want to heal people. Naga also specializes in shamanistic magic, especially spells of the earth and water variety. She enjoys creating her own golems (even if they usually don`t turn out very well), and one of her favorite spells to use is Freeze Arrow.
Naga is also able to terrorize people with her obnoxious laughing. She`s extremely proud of her highly developed, self-confident laugh and the effect that it has on unsuspecting people. She also likes to use her body to tease or distract men who are trying to go against her.
Naga carries a large sword, but she is never seen using it, possibly because she is afraid of blood. This phobia was most likely caused by witnessing her mother`s brutal slaughter. The mere sight of blood, even from a small cut, is enough to cause her to faint.</description>

<description>Nama is a suit of Living Armor, who bears many similarities to Naga. Although there is no explicit confirmation, it is strongly hinted in the series that Nama is in fact Naga`s soul trapped in a suit of Living Armor. Both Nama and Naga have the same laugh, and have similar mannerisms (although Nama`s manner of speaking is noticeably different from Naga`s, as Lina points out). Furthermore, Nama states that she was a treasure hunter who got her soul trapped in the armor as the result of touching an enchanted pot. A flashback depicting this shows Nama as a silhouette, which strongly resembles Naga. Nama also told Amelia that her mother died when she was young and was lonely as a result. Finally, Nama can perform the "Pacifist Crash" attack, a signature move of the Seyruun royal family.</description>

<name>Hellmaster Phibrizzo</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Hellmaster Phibrizzo was created during the Shinma War, and is over 5000 years old. Though the Shinma War has ended, the overall conflict between shinzoku and mazoku has not. Shabranigdu at some point created five subordinates of his own: Hellmaster Fibrizo, Chaos Dragon Garv, Greater Beast Zelas Metallium, Dynast Grausherra, and Deep Sea Dolphin.
Hellmaster Phibrizzo is the strongest of the five subordinates in service to Ruby Eye Shabranigdu, lord of the underworld, and controller of life and death. Hellmaster`s priest and general were destroyed in the Kouma War, and it is assumed that to create new ones would deplete much of his existing power.
Despite his power and eagerness to fulfill his master`s goals of destroying everything in existence, Phibrizzo rarely involved himself in the day to day matters of the world; he was more of the scheming type. He was known to patiently wait for hundreds or even thousands of years, and when everything was in place, unleash his plan to the most devastating effect. He was the one who ignited the Kouma War, which at first was a conflict between humans, to use the horrors of the war to awaken the piece of Shabranigdu in Lei Magnus, one of the Five Great Sages. He apparently succeeded, turning the war into one of the greatest conflicts of all time. However, in the end, Lei Magnus-Shabranigdu was sealed into ice, and Phibrizzo`s ultimate goal wasn`t achieved.</description>

<description>Pokota was born a human, but when he was an adolescent, the Durum sickness plagued Taforashia. The king, Pokota`s father, became very ill. Rezo, the Red Priest, appeared and sealed the residents of Taforashia in sleeping chambers to isolate them until a cure was found. Rezo sealed Pokota`s human body in a chamber, but he used a magical vase to transfer Pokota`s spirit into his current form, an animal-like creature about 2 feet tall.
Pokota`s primary physical characteristics are his large ears that function as his primary set of arms and hands, even though he has a smaller set of arms on his torso. He uses these ears to cast spells, make gestures, and glide through the air. His left ear has a gold ring near its four-fingered "hand," resembling a bracelet. In addition to flying, Pokota can also walk or run on his two short legs.
Pokota has short, beige-colored fur, a mohawk of lavender-colored hair and green fur on the ends of his ears. Beginning at his neck and ending part-way down his torso is a zipper that he opens to remove a replica Sword of Light from inside his body. He wears a red cape.</description>
