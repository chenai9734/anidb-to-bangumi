<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="161106">I have watched this anime 3 times in the past few years, it`s something about it that really makes me come back to it. The music is great and there`s alot of tragedy going on, the fights aren`t impressive but it`s not the charm of the show.

The story is a bit messy, but I find it completely forgivable. It`s enjoyable from start to end all the times I`ve watched it.

If you enjoy shoujo ai you`ll surely find this a satisfying way to pass time.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="291743">The Mecha is great. The OP/ED song is good. The storyline is touching. And the ending is heartwarming.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="162375">It`s very good anime.
The best opening ever :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="553946">Kannazuki no miko is a good anime, you should watch it if you`re into yuri/shoujo ai but I must war you that if you decide to watch this anime, have an open mind and PAY ATTENTION to the story-line. for anyone who likes mecha is also recommendable to watch as they have big robots fight each other as well.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="271580">A must see for the shoujo-ai fans out there (if you hate girl-on-girl relationships in anime, don`t bother watching this). To me, Chikane`s among the greatest female leads in anime. All that, plus the fact that the OP might be the all time best OP song EVER.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="114582">Relationship between characters is interesting. Angst &amp; Drama are impressive. Whole series &amp; ending are very intense &amp; emotive. Excellent soundtrack. OP &amp; ED have Kotoko`s greatest songs, their image sequences are perfect. Overlapping ED music is wonderfully great for angst factor &amp; you`ll want to watch more.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on the manga by http://anidb.net/cr6517 [Kaishaku].
There is a small town somewhere in Japan, which is surrounded by nature. In this town, there is a large awe-inspiring school, Otobashi Gakuen; which was founded to make the students familiar with nature.
http://anidb.net/ch9548 [Kurusugawa Himeko] is a normal student who goes to Otobashi Gakuen. She leads bright and enjoyable school days with her two friends, http://anidb.net/ch9549 [Himemiya Chikane] and http://anidb.net/ch9561 [Oogami Souma].
Chikane is the only daughter of a distinguished family, and excels at both academics and sports. She is also kind and beautiful, making her very popular among the other students. Souma is Himeko`s childhood friend. He has problems expressing his emotions directly, but he is very sincere.
On Himeko`s 16th birthday, a dark moon blocks out the sun, and the http://anidb.net/ch9550 [Orochi] come forth to destroy the world. But why are they targeting Himeko?</description>

<name>moe</name>
<description>Moe is a Japanese slang loanword that refers to feelings of strong affection mainly towards characters in anime, manga, and video games. Moe, however, has also gained usage to refer to feelings of affection towards any subject. Moe can be related to lust; however, pure lust without other feelings is considered outside its scope. The word Moe originated in the late 1980s and early 1990s in Japan and is of uncertain origin, although there are several theories on how it came into use.
At the anime level, the http://anidb.net/t7146 [cute girls doing cute things (CGDCT)] tag may also apply.

In the early years, magical girls usually used magic to solve everyday problems and often transformed into idols; nowadays, however, the term is most often used to refer to with girls who fight evil using magical powers, and, although transformations are still common, they tend to be more along the lines of a change of costume.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>comedy</name>
<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<description>All events that occurred up to a certain point are mysteriously undone, as if the Universe pressed a rewind button. This usually means some characters are being given another chance to unknowingly play out events differently, perhaps to prevent certain consequences from the previous time line`s actions. Occasionally they become doomed to repeat portions of their life over and over again until an individual event or series of events are performed correctly in just the right way, as seemingly to gain the Universe`s approval.</description>

<name>the power of love</name>
<description>The power of love is not only the strongest power known to mankind, it is the strongest power in the universe. The power of love conquers all things. It makes people cry, it makes people laugh, it can make them sing and occasionally it even brings dead people back to life, just so.
More so than the power of friendship, the power of true love gives boundless strength and resolution; by the power of love every hardship can be overcome, every issue can be resolved and it does make people resistant to food poisoning (caused by the bad cooking of their loved ones). Even the big bad evil doesn`t stand a chance against the power of true love and often ends up redeemed.
Even when the power of love is not literally and directly responsible, the scene is often set so that the audience is left with the impression that it was "really responsible".</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The Solar Priestess Himeko is a very shy, innocent 16-year-old girl. She has known Chikane for many years not knowing Chikane`s affections towards her. At first, Himeko has affections for Souma Ougami, who is her childhood friend. When the two date, their relationship puts Chikane`s heart into turmoil. She starts off considering Chikane a very close friend although the two very rarely meet outside of secrecy. Himeko is an amateur photographer of some skill - a hobby she developed thanks to the support she receives from Chikane Himemiya. Himeko is initially a shy and timid girl, uncertain of her own worth and abilities. This is mainly because she was orphaned at an early age in an unknown manner. She was initially adopted by abusive relatives before being moved to other relatives. At school, Himeko seems to have only one friend, her dorm roommate Makoto. After the destruction of the dorms when Himeko comes to live with Chikane, she soon gains the enmity of Chikane`s female fans at school- a fact she does not deal with well. Despite her timidity, Himeko gradually starts to display great determination and courage. Himeko carries the solar symbol on her chest.</description>

<name>Himemiya Chikane</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The Lunar Priestess; in sharp contrast with Himeko, Chikane is a very commanding girl of the same age. She has a very noble and elegant aura, lives in a large mansion with many maids, and is considered to be of the highest standing at their school; she has a considerable fan following of both genders and is the frequent target of love confessions. She is a member of the prestigious kyudou (Japanese archery) club and frequently uses the bow as her weapon of preference during confrontations with the Orochi, thus to defeat the other Orochi she uses the Orochi mark as a target. Later events show that she is also skilled in the use of the tantou. Her combat skills are somewhat reminiscent of those taught to the brides of samurai; possibly another indication of Chikane`s family`s high standing. Chikane is also exceptionally skilled in the areas of tennis and, more significantly, the piano; she apparently enjoys playing for Himeko, who enjoys listening to her perform. Many at school believe she has a relationship with Souma, though this is proven to be untrue. She has been in love with Himeko since they first met, although she does not reveal it until much later.
Chikane carries the lunar symbol on her back.</description>

<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="3">Organization</charactertype>
<description>The great villain of the series, an evil god who wishes to destroy the world of humanity and create its own realm, a place of darkness and nihilism. Like its counterpart from Japanese mythology, the Orochi of Kannazuki no Miko has eight "necks", its eight worshipers and followers, who are also called Orochi by association. Each of the eight possesses a mecha, which is both an "other self" for the Orochi members and an embodiment of a lesser god (which rise time and again from the ashes of destruction), which forms part of the evil deity Orochi`s body. Each individual follower has exaggerated personal characteristics; there is some indication that the evil deity granted its followers great physical strength and endurance, a limited capacity for teleportation and levitation, as well as a unique power or weapon to suit their individual character. A follower who has the willpower to repress the wellspring of rage that rises in their minds when Orochi claims them can use the powers they have gained against Orochi. The evil deity, unfortunately, administers a dire punishment to those who resist it. Orochi chooses its followers from those who have experienced great pain in their lives and have given in to despair. The six evil Orochi fit easily into archetypes, consisting of a sociopathic criminal, an unintelligent brute, a former pop idol, an anti-social manga artist, a catgirl, and a disillusioned nun.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The First Neck, he is considered to be the leader and the most powerful of the Orochi. Tsubasa is a tall teal-haired bishounen, as well as a (presumed) sociopathic criminal with a long record, starting with the murder of his abusive father, whom he killed in order to protect his younger brother. Tsubasa is also Souma`s biological older brother, having left the young child in the care of the Oogami family when he went on the run.
His mech, Take no Yasukunazuchi, has deployable wing-like structures which it uses to fly, and attacks with swords mounted on its arms.
In personal combat, Tsubasa mainly uses a sword, although he has shown some skill with throwing knives as well.
He carries the mark of Orochi over his heart.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The Second Neck, she is a purple-haired nun who is the first Orochi to appear and attack, having lost her faith due to living through a terrible war. Although there is little co-operation among the Orochi, she seems to be the closest thing therein to a second-in-command having great respect for Tsubasa and the most cool-headed of the lot; it is also implied that she holds an unrequited love for Tsubasa. She can control Girochi and induce some semblance of cooperation among the three other female Necks.
Her mech, Yatsu no Onokoshizuchi, vaguely resembles a lightning demon in appearance, having no arms but an array of tentacles and a giant circle of electrodes on its back which fire deadly beams.
In personal contact, Miyako can make use of enchanted mirrors to create complex illusions and to spy on others over distances. She is a skilled manipulator and a keen observer.
There is some indication that she carries the mark of Orochi on her throat.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The Third Neck, he is one of the first Orochi to attack the Miko. He is a very large man with heavy chains hanging off him, which he uses as weapons. He is attracted to Himeko and wishes to go on a date with her, which only fuels Chikane`s jealous protectiveness of the Solar Miko. Girochi is said to be Miyako`s younger brother.
In a flashback scene, he is shown in a scene of destruction as a young boy, crying near a body crushed under a collapsed building. Presumably, the same war that destroyed his sister`s church claimed the life of their parents and left Girochi traumatized and disillusioned.
His mecha, Hi no Ashinazuchi, is nicknamed Gungal, and it is characterized by an excessively large right arm — so large that the entire mech`s body can fit inside it when he uses it as a weapon (the "Megaton Knuckle" attack).
He carries the mark of Orochi on the back of his right hand.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The Fourth Neck, she is a delusional pop idol whose dismal sales (68th, though Reiko constantly taunts her with "69th") are partly responsible for her becoming one of the Orochi. She is almost manic in her behavior, constantly trying to impress the other Orochi with her showmanship, but her energetic exterior hides a dark past.
A flashback scene depicts her lying on a bed next to an older man, with much of her clothing torn; the exact nature of the liaison, as well as the reasons behind it, are left unsaid, although the scene is accompanied by the suggestion that Corona was "betrayed by [her] dreams".
Her mech, Ooube no Senazuchi, nicknamed Final Stage, takes on the forms of a wheel with a demonic eye in its center and of a giant centipede with an anthropoid head and arms.
In personal combat, Corona throws lipsticks at her target. This attack is not as harmless as it might sound, since these lipsticks apparently carry a kinetic charge capable of causing explosions.
There is some indication that she carries the mark of Orochi on her left breast.</description>

<description>The Fifth Neck, she is an antisocial mangaka of few words. Reiko continues her "day job" as a member of the Orochi and has in fact done better on the market since joining, though her manga have taken on very dark themes since then. She barely interacts with the other Orochi and is stone-cold in battle, though her level-headedness is more the product of cynicism and numbness than Miyako`s.
Her mecha, Ho no Shuraizuchi, takes on the forms of a Joumon-style (straw-rope pattern) fired pottery jar and an anthropoid shape.
In personal combat, Reiko throws fountain pens at her targets. Like Corona`s lipsticks, these apparently carry a kinetic charge capable of causing explosions.
Interestingly, Himeko adores Reiko`s work and is apparently an avid reader of hers.
There is some indication that she carries the mark of Orochi on her back.</description>

<description>The Sixth Neck, she is a small, squeaky-voiced catgirl who is often seen wearing a nurse`s outfit and wielding a giant syringe. She appears to fit the stereotypical, cheerful catgirl archetype, but it is later revealed that she was the subject and victim of horrible medical experiments, which is most likely what made her an Orochi follower. Nekoko`s syringe contains some form of medication that can heal injuries and sickness, but the injection causes horrible pain, as noted by Girochi. Alternatively, Nekoko can launch the syringe like a rocket, carrying the same kind of kinetic charge displayed by Tsubasa`s knives, Corona`s lipsticks and Reiko`s fountain pens.
Her mech, Izuhara no Tamazuchi, nicknamed Meow Meow (Nya Nya), is a large mechanical ball with many cannons on it that is capable of destroying buildings easily.
There is some indication that she carries the mark of Orochi on her bottom.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The Seventh Neck, he is the only Orochi who was able to resist becoming completely evil. Souma is the lone protector of Himeko and Chikane for most of the series and later plays a part in bringing the Orochi down. He has a very high social standing at their school, comparable to Chikane`s, and most of their fellow students believe they are dating, though in truth they rarely interact until the Orochi events. Like Chikane, he is in love with Himeko and is extremely protective of her, fighting to keep her safe from Orochi.
Souma`s mecha, Take no Yamikazuchi, is a humanoid robot that possesses more varied attacks than most of the other mecha, which it conceals within its own body. It is similar to that of Gundam and attack is similar to Big O.
In personal combat, Souma initially uses his own body and sometimes his motorcycle. Later on, he adopts the sword and fighting-style of his brother Tsubasa, significantly increasing his power.
He carries the mark of Orochi on his forehead.</description>

Aside from playing a humorous role and some very weighty scenes of her own in the series, she is a support character who clarifies how Chikane reserved her feelings for Himeko alone. Otoha`s feelings for Chikane are further explored; when she is sent away due to all of the commotion, she confesses to Chikane on how much she cares for her and admires her. When Otoha is embraced and thanked by Chikane, she blushes and cries.</description>
