<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>music</name>
<description>Music anime generally revolves around people concerned with music in their everyday lives. In addition they often adhere to certain genre conventions, the emphasis on training and practice in preparation for competitions, characters desire for self improvement, and pursuit of a specific goal. This is not unlike the Sports category.</description>

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>fan-made</name>
<description>Produced by an unofficial entity, totally unrelated to any commercial production studio/company (maybe even a group of friends with an idea, access to some equipment, a very tight budget, and lots of spare time). "Made for fans by fans" in its purest form.
Don`t expect big-bucks animation, top-notch voice actors or overly-elaborate scripts, but sometimes you can get a very nice surprise from that kind of productions, so don`t write them off that fast!
In Japan, this kind of of productions is also known as "doujin" (同人) - self-published works.</description>

<name>Hakurei Reimu</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine, a remote building far in the east where the boundaries of Gensokyo and the human world overlap. Reimu is very easygoing— some would say lazy— and hates to train. As such, even though she`s naturally talented, her offensive and magical abilities are only average. However, she has a strong sense of duty, and if it`s for the sake of Gensokyo she can overcome almost any obstacle through sheer perseverance. Her main abilities are flying in the sky, good intuition, and getting along with everyone; even those who were once her enemies.</description>

<name>Kirisame Marisa</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Marisa is a human magician who lives in a cluttered house in the Forest of Magic. She is friends with Reimu and visits her often, but otherwise is solitary and spends most of her time researching magic. She is also an avid collector stuffing her house with various items, and would go "borrowing" things from others without returning them. She is selfish, sometimes violent, and has a disagreeable manner. Underneath, though, she is honest and a hard worker. This makes it strange that she is friends with Reimu, whose powers are purely from talent while she had to work very hard to get her own to the same level. Her ability is high-level destructive magic.</description>

<name>Shameimaru Aya</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Aya is a reporter and photographer who runs Gensokyo`s one-woman newspaper, the Bunbunmaru Shinbun. She has a serious character, at odds with her reporting; she loves rumours and her newspaper is filled with gossip about the girls of Gensokyo, sometimes on the verge of being a tabloid. To Reimu`s irritation, however, she rejects the stories of a certain shrine maiden saving Gensokyo as unverifiable. Not one to show off, she rarely fights of her own volition, though she has contempt for those she thinks are weak.</description>

<name>Ibuki Suika</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A girl who insists that she is an oni, even though Gensokyo supposedly doesn`t have any. Suika and Yugi Hoshiguma were once part of the four devas of the mountains, long ago before the oni retreated underground. As an oni, she loves drinks, feasts, and competition. Despite her small size, she is strong in strength, speed, and mystic powers; she is also several hundred years old. Using her ability to control density, she can gather people to form a banquet, or she can scatter herself to become mist.</description>

<name>Remilia Scarlet</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Remilia is the vampiric mistress of the Scarlet Devil Mansion who claims to be descended from Vlad III Dracula although she is not. She is known as the Scarlet Devil as when she feeds, the blood of her victims stains her dress red. Apart from her unpleasant needs, she`s hardly malicious enough to deserve such a title; merely childish, even though she`s over five hundred years old. Although being a vampire is normally a lonely life, she has a good relationship with her many employees (including Sakuya and Meiling).</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Sakuya is the only human living in the Scarlet Devil Mansion, yet she is also the head maid. Though she looks about sixteen like the other girls, Sakuya has the ability to slow, stop and possibly reverse time. She seems to have been serving Remilia for a long time and may be far older than she looks. Her talents are cooking, knife throwing and time manipulation.</description>

<name>Flandre Scarlet</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Flandre is the younger sister of Remilia and the "dirty little secret" of Scarlet Devil Mansion. Because of her unstable personality and incredible destructive power, her sister has had her ordered not to get out of the mansion for nearly 500 years. She knows little about the world outside and until the heroines arrived during the Extra Stage of Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, she has had no substantive contact with any humans other than Sakuya.</description>
