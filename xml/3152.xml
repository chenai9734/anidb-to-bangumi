<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<description>Sometimes normal just doesn`t cut it. Eating: you put food in your mouth and chew. Playing sports: you throw a ball around. You need to make it awesome, no matter how mundane it is.
Let`s throw in some gripping orchestral music, lighting changes, different camera angles, something! Don`t write like a man, write like an evil overlord! Exaggerate your expressions and gestures, speak with excessive intonation, and if all else fails, throw in some close-ups, slow motion, and ominous Latin chanting! With practice, even you can turn something like eating chips into an epic battle of light and dark, blinding the viewer with sheer awesomeness.

<name>the power of love</name>
<description>The power of love is not only the strongest power known to mankind, it is the strongest power in the universe. The power of love conquers all things. It makes people cry, it makes people laugh, it can make them sing and occasionally it even brings dead people back to life, just so.
More so than the power of friendship, the power of true love gives boundless strength and resolution; by the power of love every hardship can be overcome, every issue can be resolved and it does make people resistant to food poisoning (caused by the bad cooking of their loved ones). Even the big bad evil doesn`t stand a chance against the power of true love and often ends up redeemed.
Even when the power of love is not literally and directly responsible, the scene is often set so that the audience is left with the impression that it was "really responsible".</description>

<name>Hatsuno Hana</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Hatsuno Hana is a childhood friend of Mamoru Amami, and closet love interest. Her cousin Ayame it often dragging her into dangerous situations. Hana remains unaware of Mamoru`s involvement in the events surrounding the Zonder invasion until Intestine Primeval captures her and several of the other children onboard the ship that the Primeval had used as robo material. At this point she sees Mamoru in his Latio form on their return to StealthGao II - Mamoru is unaware of this, and it is not until near the last battle with the Z-Master that she reveals this information to him. She was under the impression that the real Mamoru was replaced by an alien, and is relieved to know that Mamoru is the same one she has known all along, and becomes a steadfast supporter of Mamoru in the events to come. The other children soon thereafter declare that Mamoru and Hana should get married. She later reveals Mamoru`s identity to the other children during the battle with the New Machine Species Zonuda. In the epilogue, Hana comes to say goodbye to Mamoru wearing a wedding dress - the two share a kiss before Mamoru leaves with Galeon.
In King of Braves GaoGaiGar FINAL, Hana is the one with whom the introduction begins, taking a litter of Yosef`s puppies on a walk when she finds the wounded Ikumi Kaidou (Arma) engaged in combat with Repli-Mamoru. After the battle concludes (leading to the destruction of a harbor but leaving Hana and her dogs unscathed), Hana takes the unconscious Kaidou back to her home and questions him as to Mamoru`s actions and whereabouts. As the actions in the Trinary Solar System continue, Hana is often looked in upon to show the degradation of the situation on Earth. Despite the destruction being wrought upon the Earth, Hana remains determined that she will see Mamoru again. In the finale, she gets her wish, and is seen standing side-by-side with Mamoru and Kaidou before the memorial erected in honor of the GGG members who went missing in the crisis. She is also one of the singers for the first verse of Someday in the Sea of Stars: Character Version, which plays during said finale.
For much of the television series, Hana has an unfortunate tendency to be knocked unconscious. She almost compulsively repeats the phrase "I`m not scared" in times of mental stress - this was first taught to her by Mamoru as a coping mechanism.</description>

<name>Utsugi Mikoto</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Guy`s girlfriend and a GGG computer operator. Mikoto is responsible for launching the Gao Machines, activating the Final Fusion program and sending out equipment like the Dividing Driver.
Mikoto is a crucial part of the activation process of the Goldion Hammer, doing the final "relieving" of its safety device.
Mikoto`s parents died when EI-01 hit Tokyo. After passing out in the aftermath, the Zonderian Pasder implanted into her the spore of a new Zonder type, which slowly developed in her unbeknownst to her and everyone throughout the series. Following the defeat of the Primevals, the spore awoke, turning her into the "new machine species", or Zonuda. She drained all of the power out of the 3G Space Base, before landing in Tokyo in a fragment of one of the base ships. As a core part of Zonuda, Mikoto was alert but unable to do anything. After being reduced to a core in a final battle with GaoGaiGar, Zonuda turned back into its human-sized robot form, with Mikoto still contained within. Guy managed to use Mamoru to purify her, however, transforming the two into Evoluders.
Mikoto`s Evoluder abilities are less clear than Guy`s. She demonstrates that her nerve cells, at least, are capable of regeneration, and later shows high telepathic abilities (communicating with both Guy and Papillon Noir in spirit form numerous times throughout episode 8 of FINAL). Papillon at one point says that Mikoto became "an invincible life-form like the new machine species", which could be taken to mean that Mikoto is in fact incapable of being killed permanently, possessing a Zonuda-like regenerative ability.</description>

<description>Taiga Koutarou is the loud, proud, and quite energetic president of the Space Development Corporation and chief of the Gutsy Geoid (later Galaxy) Guard. It is Taiga`s job to oversee GGG`s mission, and to approve the use of necessary procedures (Final Fusion, Symmetrical Docking) as well as more crucial and untested equipment (Goldion Hammer, Goldion Crusher, Projectile X and so on).
As Chief, his job is also to report to the GGG`s overseeing body (the Japanese Diet, then later the U.N) and also request more budget allocations as well as argue GGG`s case and purpose on occasion.
While GGG was based in Japan, his approval essentially represented the Prime Minister`s approval, and in space, it represented the approval of the U.N. Secretary General (according to the box containing the Gold Key).
He is apparently married and has two daughters(though it is not mentioned in the series or FINAL), and enjoys playing golf when not on duty as President or Chief. As such, he is handy with a golf club (the "Titanium-Head Driver" and later the "Taiga Wood").</description>

Former astronaut and test pilot for the Space Development Corporation. In 2003, he had been in orbit testing an experimental space shuttle when an extraterrestrial object (later classified as EI-01) suddenly appeared in his flight path, smashing his shuttle out of the way. This left the shuttle disabled and Guy himself in a near-death state.
The alien mechanical lion, Galeon, would then appear and deal a crushing blow to EI-01, sending it out of orbit to land on Earth. Thereafter, Galeon would find the critically wounded Guy and return him to the Space Development Corporation. Adapting Galeon`s technologies, his father Leo Shishioh would create a cyborg body for his son (with a G-Stone-powered mechanical heart), saving his life and giving him superhuman strength.</description>

<name>Soldato J</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Only known surviving member of the Soldato Battalion, a series of combat cyborgs developed by the Red Planet`s leader, Abel. They would function as commanders of the J-Ark fleet, and perform Fusion with them to fight the Z-Master. Abel`s extensive preparations would not be enough, however, as the failure to unite Soldato, Alma bioweapon, living computer, and J-Ark battleship into a cohesive team would lead to the failure of the world`s defenses and, eventually, the planet`s mechanization. As a Cyborg, Soldato J has impressive strength and speed. The green scarf attached to his armor can extend and harden into a pair of wings for flight, and the left gauntlet contains a Radiant Ripper, an energy sword. While normally used with both hands, the Radiant Ripper can be used while still attached to the gauntlet, as seen in FINAL.
As one of the two surviving members of the Battalion, Soldato J 002 fought alone (his J-Ark`s main computer—Tomoro 0117—had been lost to Zonder infection and his J-Ark was sent into space to protect its infant Alma onboard), going so far as to confront Arm Primeval, one of the leaders behind the offensive on his world. J would confront Arm alone, and barely lost their confrontation, forced to flee into the wasteland that was now his planet. He was subsequently captured by his own living computer—transformed into the Zonderian Pinchernone—and converted into the Zonderian Pizza, the memory of his proud past sealed away.
As Pizza, he and Pinchernone would accompany the Zonderian "terminal" program Pasder to the "Blue Planet"—Earth—with the order to infect all of humanity with Zonder Metal. Even as a Zonderian, however, Pizza would have brief flashes of the time before he was mechanized. He became a great rival of the GGG Mobile Unit commander Guy Shishioh; through his duels with Guy, his old pride began to recover, along with his a sense of his old purpose. In a burst of defiance, he protected his rival from a direct attack from Pasder, leaving him critically wounded. He would be saved by his Arma, who had landed on Earth and had adopted the identity of Ikumi Kaidou. Kaidou performed Purification on Pizza and Pinchernone, restoring to them their true forms and memories.
Following his restoration, Soldato J would dedicate himself to his original mission once again: to destroy the Z-Master. To this end he would re-unite with his team in his J-Ark (crashed within Mt. Aso in Kyuushuu, Japan) and wait for the arrival of the 31 Machine Primevals. Upon the Primevals` arrival on Earth, he showed just how powerful the original Red Planet fleet could have been had it been properly organized. They began an independent mission to destroy the Primevals—ignoring the battles of the Gutsy Galaxy Guard, going over their heads and even clashing with them head-on. As J and GGG realized they had a common goal, however, they began to grudgingly help each other to defeat the 31 Primevals.
During this time, J would also confront and destroy the other surviving member of the Soldato Battalion: Soldato J #019, who had since pledged his loyalty to the Z-Master and had his J-Jewel replaced with a Zonder Crystal (this story was told in the manga serial "Wings of Light and Darkness").
In the final battle with the Z-Master, J and Kaidou entered Heart Primeval and set "THE POWER" in the J-Ark to overload, creating a cascade reaction that would destroy the Z-Master from within (also critically damaging King J-Der in the process). Judging this to be a fair trade, J and his team were fully willing to sacrifice themselves in order to end the Zonder threat once and for all. It was revealed that the J-Ark survived the final fight, falling into a wormhole generated by "THE POWER" and emerging at a point 90 million light-years outside of the universe. There, the J-Ark began its slow restoration process. From their unique perspective, Tomoro 0117 determined that the universe was contracting in size; tracking down the source of the contraction, the J-Ark reappeared within Earth`s solar system in orbit of Jupiter, where they found an exhausted Mamoru Amami and a mysterious device called the Pas-Q Machine. As Mamoru asked Kaidou to take this device to Earth, Pia Decem of the 11 Planetary Masters of Sol attacked; Kaidou returned to Earth with the Machine, but J retreated to the Tri-Star System with Mamoru.
Soldato-J and his J-Ark covered Mamoru`s retreat to the G-Crystal but were themselves captured by the other Masters of Sol and imprisoned on the repli-Earth created by the Pas-Q Machine (at the island of Mont Saint Michel). They would thereafter be freed by Renais-Kerdif Shishioh and Mikoto Utsugi, only to face Palus Abel—the 11 Masters` leader whose program was based on Abel herself. She would soon after reveal that she had captured Ikumi Kaidou and was using him as the living computer core of Pia Decem Pit; unable to attack Pia Decem directly because of this, King J-Der was soon forced into a fight with a mind-controlled Guy Shishioh. The resulting clash between J-Quath and Goldion Hammer left both weapons destroyed. Palus Abel routed remote commands through Kaidou to shut down the J-Ark and Soldato J`s own J-Jewel; Pia Decem and Pillnus captured him and Renais Kerdif-Shishioh soon after, though they would escape through sheer accident—bringing Renais` G-Stone into proximity with Soldato-J`s J-Jewel restored them both, activating their Hyper Modes. It is at this point that J`s helmet is partially broken, allowing the only view of his eyes in the series. With the subsequently rectivated J-Ark, they proceeded to confront Palus Abel aboard the Pia Decem Pit.
Despite many fans using the translation "Soldat", the correct (and official) translation is Soldato. Soldato is an Italian word(like Arma and Pizza) and means "Soldier". Soldat, though, does mean "Soldier" in several languages as well, including Swedish
Soldato J appears to be a homage to Cyborg 002 of Cyborg 009, who together share a similar design, common number, personality, and fondness for flying. Sunrise and Toei Animation collaborated on a Cyborg 009 adaption in the late 1970`s, the era of which GaoGaiGar attempts to thematically honor.</description>

<name>Renais Kerdif Shishiou</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Renais Kerdif Shishiou is Raiga Shishioh`s daughter by Freres Kerdif. She was abducted by the criminal organization BioNet in 2002 shortly following their murder of her mother (a BioNet agent herself gone rogue) and turned into a cyborg. Over the course of two years, she was trained as a killing machine, and ordered to swear loyalty to her captors; she chose to defy them instead, attacking them with the weapons they had equipped her with. For this outrage, she was chained up in a BioNet facility to die in 2004, where she was discovered in time and rescued by the French intelligence agency (and GGG partner organization) Chasseur.
Dr. Raiga—who was visiting France at the time—volunteered to help save Renais`s life, managing to do so with the addition of a portable GS-Generator to her cybernetics. Renais would eventually join Chasseur in an ongoing effort to destroy the organization that modified her, showing no mercy against its members.
Far less of her body was altered than Cyborg Guy`s. Her modifications, however, have a problem with generating extreme heat—a flaw in BioNet`s design that even Raiga wasn`t able to properly remedy. As a result of this, Renais must always wear a cooling coat over her body or risk overheating. Any normal human being that touches her without proper protection risks suffering severe burns. However, Soldato J is perfectly able to touch her without injury, thanks to the fact that the Red Planet was a world aflame. For this reason, as well as the mutual respect they gained from their fights with their counterparts Pillnus and Pia Decem, Renais and J began to develop a relationship at the very end of FINAL, where she piloted King J-Der in conjunction with J. The results of this incident may have been the reason for the usage of Ikumi Kaidou as one of the Head Divers of the Super Neuromechanoid GaoGaiGo.
Like Cyborg Guy, she is able to enter an Equip form, and access Hyper Mode in certain conditions. In both situations, her cooling coat expands and stiffens into lateral "vanes" to handle the additional heat exchange required.
The spelling of her name is not always consistent; her first name in various sources has been rendered as "Lune", "Rune", "Renat" and "Renée;" her mother`s maiden name is frequently rendered as "Cardiff" and occasionally as "Cirdef." This Wiki uses the most-commonly-used spelling, which is consistently used in GaoGaiGar FINAL material and the second half of the novel "The King of Braves GaoGaiGar: Queen of Leo &lt;Leon Reine&gt;."</description>
