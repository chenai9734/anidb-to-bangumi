<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="496694">What had me wrapped into this anime was not only the voice acting, story, and animations, but it gives one an idea of what a "loner" is like and how intellectual people really are that may say nothing to you in person.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="31909">Great show. Awesome comedy elements and fun racy characters. A show I haven`t seen for awhile. Would love to see a second season for this show</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="172963">Now take a look at that! A bizarre show with ecchi that`s actually a brilliant comedy! The brilliant voice actors do the rest. I can recommend this to everyone how wants some great executed jokes!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="616779">do not get discouraged by the fact that it is yet again a LN inspired show - yes , again  pretty OP characters that seem to know it all - yes again some weird brother/sister relationship...but this time_____ITS WORTH IT___its interesting , fun, mysterious with a fair amount of twist and action that keep u entertain ... some ecchi here and there ... but overall a really cool adventure to jump in ... I was surprised by the well thought plot , the lovable characters that contrary to some other LN shows were actually not boring to watch and finaly  the intriguing fantasy world that seems to hold many secrets .....  overall its was a great watch... in fact i would say its  enough to be considered as of a  recommended/must try to watch - enjoy</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="20352">Originally it`s difficult to see how this series will turn out due to the novel being so fresh and new. With 5 volumes at the time of airing, I worried on its series length and content. But having run through all 12 episodes, my doubts were laid to rest. The progression, style, and character designs were impressive. And the series ends off nicely to show off the promise that it can go on despite relying on how much progress the novel counterpart can make.  My only disappointment is the lengthy wait we`ll have between this and its possible/potential follow-up sequel. Acciente!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="477067">After ep.6 this really takes off as an excellent mix of all things otaku and fantasy. The setting is really well thought out, although the puzzle/gambles can be a little.. pretentious at times, for lack of a better word, but this is without a doubt one of the more enjoyable anime of the year.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="24572">An enjoyable anime set in an ambitious, unique world built on playing games. Vivid and saturated animation, kinda artsy. For some it`s eyebleed but plot might be worth sticking around for. Among many wits and twists in this anime you get ecchi, parody and cheesy comedy that keeps everything from being overly serious. The MCs won`t win hearts but their interesting personalities add lots to the storyline.

The anime covers the first 3 volumes of the light novel, suddenly skipping to some events in volume 6 (9 volumes made so far but slow progression). Seriously doubt there will ever be a sequel, despite open-ended. Usually ecchi comedy genre don`t have sequels due to limited popularity. This was however an exception and surely a recommended watch. Great OP.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="760053">must watch finish this

after watch no game no life movie epic rating 10/10</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="463724">Recommended for fans of fantasy world travel, and deep and intricate planning ahead, with two prodigy main characters (with male character being a badass and a pervert!). And, for anyone who enjoys board games and such, as well as a nice comedy! In my book it definitely lacked more episodes for a nice wrap-up, so as usual everything seemed so rushed and not given enough episodes to develop well, so that`s why it`s not a must for me. Otherwise it was pretty neat!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="87321">An EPIC journey of conquering your enemies with pure brilliance! If you enjoy shows where the main protagonist plans a million steps in advance to secure his victory, this is the show for you! Too bad it`s only 12 episodes, I cannot wait for a second season!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="296685">Visually very impressive in terms of quality and design. Good characters and exciting episodes with admittedly hit or miss comedy. This anime has a lot going for it with only a few drawbacks.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="139572">There is no anime that can beat No Game No Life in terms of enjoyment atm. Its brilliant. Thats all i can say.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="554678">Interesting and CLEVER. If Sherlock Holmes was a NEET</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="445831">It`s funny with very interesting plots and setting, but somehow not that surprising for me. The characters are interesting and pretty but without development.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="147092">Just amazing.  Original concept and the main characters are enjoyable.  Puts NEET in a whole new perspective.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="600311">great start, nice story and unique atmosphere.
recommended for fantasy ecchi harem comedy lovers</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="523684">I bet this anime win all the awards in this category. Definitely a must see!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="30352">Give me more! I need the whole chess piece!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="449787">At first, I watch it will like SAO and similarities. But... when you look through into it, you will find in different ways of how we describe it. This is the EPIC battle of Wits, Strategy, Mental, skill also how to overcome problems in battle of game. This remind me of Mondaiji that I watch. Rare to find it same like this.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="506415">Most likely will be best anime of the year if it keeps this solid. Nice plot twists, takes an interesting perspective on solving conflicts and the characters are very well done. The outstanding level of animation and occasional ecchi only serve to make this series even better.
Recommended for everyone!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="618709">The artwork, the story and concept has me sucked in like no other anime.

A must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="521116">If there are animes that anyone has to see, this is one of them. The visuals, the story, the characters, it is just fantastic. I as a gamer and an otaku LOVE IT. It is like you are in an online community, but not playing, you experience it in a very special way, once you see it, a little part of you, wants to start his console or PC and start challenging people online. One of the best animes SO FAR. The world would`ve been much better place if conflicts were decided by games, not by wars. I JUST LOVE IT !!! I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT IT WON`T BE 12 EPISODES, OR IF IT IS, I HOPE THERE WILL BE A SECOND SEASON !!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="607530">It`s not every day you find an anime quite as engrossing as this one.  From the very first episode it immediately sucked me in and had me addicted to it.  Great animation, amazing battles  full of wit, not to mention great comedy.  In short, this is an anime everyone has to see at least once.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="78881">Fast paced anime (sprinkled with a bit of game theory) with lots of twists and great humor in between. Characters are interesting as they are both weak and strong at the same time, and the animation was seamless which makes this anime a joy to watch. 

It also had a good season ending which is rare nowadays.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="33154">This show is by far EPIC! It`s rare to see a show that is worth to recommending nowadays but this is it!

You can tell how much thought the Author Kamiya Yuu put into to write this story with the beautiful art to back it up it`s a must see.

Up to ep 6 now and that is what you call a battle of wit. Hope they keep it up and don`t disappoint me.</recommendation>

<description>http://anidb.net/ch62621 [Sora] and http://anidb.net/ch62620 [Shiro], a brother and sister whose reputations as brilliant NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) hikikomori (shut-in) gamers have spawned urban legends all over the internet. These two gamers even consider the real world as just another crappy game.
One day, they are summoned by a boy named http://anidb.net/ch62617 [Teto] to an alternate world, where he is the god. There, Teto has prohibited war and declared this to be a world where everything is decided by games — even national borders. Humanity has been driven back into one remaining city by the other races. Will Sora and Shiro, the good-for-nothing brother and sister, become the Saviours of Humanity on this alternate world?
"Well, let`s start playing."

<name>elf</name>
<description>The origin of Elves (Norse; álfar(elves), álfr(elf)) can be found in ancient Norse mythology, in which, elves are described as divine, or near-divine, race of humanoids (Vættir), likened to the Æsir. In common description they are described as sage and immortal beings occupying the threshold between humans and the gods. In some cases humans that were beloved by the gods became elves within their lives. Ancient Elves are delineated into a pair of similar but distinct races; Light Elves (Ljósálfar) and Dark Elves (Svartálfar), each originating from separate homes within the nine worlds of Yggdrasil. Within the Poetic Edda the differences are commonly ascribed as:
"There is one place there that is called the Elf Home (Álfheimr which is the elven city). People live there that are named the light elves (Ljósálfar). But the dark elves (Dökkálfar) live below in earth, in caves and the dark forest and they are unlike them in appearance - and more unlike them in reality. The Light Elves are brighter than the sun in appearance, but the Dark Elves are blacker than pitch." (Snorri, Gylfaginning 17, Prose Edda)</description>

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

For example, they may comment about the background music, quip about the script or narration, complain about the roles given to them by the writer or their lack of screen time, see the subtitles that appear on screen, inform the audience about the arrival of the commercial break, and even use medium effects as tools. The most common form of medium awareness is known as breaking the fourth wall, in which characters speak directly to the audience, either to it as a whole or to specific members of it. The "fourth wall" is the imaginary "wall" at the front of the stage of a proscenium theatre through which the audience sees the play; it is a metaphor for the boundary between what happens inside the work, to the characters, and outside it, to the audience.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>parallel world</name>
<description>A parallel world, parallel universe, or alternative reality is a self-contained separate reality coexisting with our own. Because "alternative reality" sometimes implies that the reality is a variant of our own, like for example a mirror world, we use the term "parallel world/universe" which is more general, without any connotations implying a relationship (or lack thereof) with our own world/universe (meaning a fictional world can just as well have an alternative reality, it doesn`t need to be our reality). To put it more simply, this category is to show if more than 1 world/universe/reality is present in the anime.
Multiple timelines of the same world/universe/reality are NOT considered parallel worlds. For example, in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate] the cast travels through multiple "World Lines", which are defined as parallel timelines of the same universe had various events occurred with differing outcomes.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<description>Racism is prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of an ethnically different background based on the pseudo-scientific belief that biological differences between peoples form so-called "races" and that one`s own "race" is superior to another, possibly also holding that members of different "races" should be treated differently. Some definitions include only consciously malignant forms of discrimination, and some views include discriminatory behaviors and beliefs based on cultural, national, ethnic, caste, or religious stereotypes. In works of fiction, this may also include similar actions against other sentient species.

Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<name>card games</name>
<description>A card game is any game using playing cards as the primary device with which the game is played, be they traditional or game-specific. Countless card games exist, including families of related games (such as poker). A small number of card games played with traditional decks have formally standardized rules, but most are folk games whose rules vary by region, culture, and person.
Many games that are not generally placed in the family of card games do in fact use cards for some aspect of their gameplay. Similarly, some games that are placed in the card game genre involve a board. The distinction is that the gameplay of a card game primarily depends on the use of the cards by players (the board is simply a guide for scorekeeping or for card placement), while board games (the principal non-card game genre to use cards) generally focus on the players` positions on the board, and use the cards for some secondary purpose.</description>

What defines the isekai genre is that the characters are sent to another world, often but not always a parallel one, and they generally cannot come back permanently without meeting a highly specific goal.
In order to adapt to their new environment, they must use the abilities and knowledge brought from their former world as well as any that may have been bestowed upon them by their brave new world. In some cases, they will seek and eventually find a way to return; in others, they will gleefully embrace their new life.
http://anidb.net/a144 [Inuyasha] is an example where isekai applies to a fictional world that is not also a parallel or virtual world. http://anidb.net/ch7246 [Higurashi Kagome] climbs down an ancient well at her grandfather`s shrine and is transported to feudal Japan (time travel). While she eventually gains the physical ability to travel back and forth between her time period and feudal Japan, her bonds and responsibilities to feudal Japan tie her there until they are ultimately resolved.
For clarity, below is an illustrative example where isekai is applied to a non-fictional, non-parallel, non-virtual world.

* The main characters are from Earth. One day, they are abducted by Nazis from Mars (alternate "world") are brought back to their Martian base. The main characters are trapped on Mars. Their only escape is to defeat the Nazis and steal their spaceship to return to Earth (specific goal required to escape); they are left to thier own devices, with no prospect of help from Earth, and no way to contact Earth.
