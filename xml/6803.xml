<name>kodomo</name>
<description>In the context of manga and associated media, the word kodomo refers to a children`s audience roughly for the ages 12 and younger. In Japanese, the word means simply "child", and has no anime/manga-related connotations at all. It does not comprise a style or a genre per se, but rather indicates the publisher`s intended target demographic.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Dewgong`s name is derived from the real animal which has a similar, but much larger, body: the dugong. In the beta versions of Red/Blue, Dewgong`s name was originally going to be Manaty, a reference to the manatee. The Pokémon first appears in the arsenal of a trainer named "Allison" outside of Saffron City, who cites her similar body fat percentage as a reason for her choosing to utilize the Water/Ice type Pokémon.</description>

<description>Magikarp is a commonly found Pokémon that can survive in rivers, lakes,and oceans. Despite its adaptability, the Pokédex states that the Magikarp species has grown weaker over time, and it is one of the least viable for battling in the series. It eventually evolves into another, far more powerful Pokémon, Gyarados.
Magikarp is commonly thought of as the weakest Pokémon. They are only able to learn three moves: Splash (does absolutely nothing), Tackle (a weak attack), and Flail (which does more damage as Magikarp is more damaged.)
In the anime, Magikarp has appeared several times, most notably as the subject of a running gag in which a salesman attempts to trick Team Rocket into buying Magikarp in various guises. (This man also appears in Pokémon Red, Blue, Yellow, FireRed, and LeafGreen.) Team Rocket later adopted a Magikarp-shaped submarine.
Magikarp also appear many times in the video games. They can be found in almost any pond, river, lake, or sea. Many trainers have them, along with other weak Water Pokémon like Goldeen or Horsea. In Pokémon Pearl, one trainer named "Ander," found outside Lake Valor, possesses a Magikarp whose move "Quake" replaces the normal Magikarp`s equally useless "Splash".</description>

<description>Marill is an aquatic mouse Pokémon. Marill`s tail floats like a buoy because it is filled with oil, which is less dense than water. When fishing at a fast-running stream, Marill wraps its tail around a tree. Since the tail is stretchy and flexible, it allows the Pokémon to get food and still stay safely anchored. Otherwise, when in a lake, it uses the buoy-qualities of its tail to keep itself suspended as the rest of its body dives underwater to feed on aquatic plants. Its fur is impermeable, which keeps it dry, and that allows it to swim through water at high speed without being slowed by the water`s resistance.
In the Pokémon Anime, Tracey, the Pokémon Observer from the Orange Islands, has a Marill which he uses on multiple occasions.</description>

<description>Remoraid is a Remora-based suckerfish that scavenges for food and has a somewhat symbiotic relationship with Mantine. Remoraid will attach itself to the underbelly of Mantine with its dorsal fin, eating scraps of food that Mantine drops as well as the parasites on them that causes them to itch. In return, the Mantine helps defend the Remoraid from enemies. When not scavenging for food, Remoraid will strike down its own prey with precise accuracy using fast streams of airborne water, which Remoraid shoots from its mouth using abdominal muscles. Remoraid can move faster through the water by blasting water from its mouth in the opposite direction of where it intends to move.</description>

<description>Wailord is a gigantic, oceanic mammal with the largest known size of all Pokémon. Living in the vast oceans of the Pokémon world, Wailord swims languorously in pods of about four members or more, often at the surface so it can breathe through its upper nostrils. With huge mouths these Pokémon can eat massive amounts of undersea food, such as krill, in a single gulp. When chasing somewhat larger prey, Wailord herd them by leaping out of the water and making humongous splashes in what is often described as a breathtaking display. If a Wailord inhales to the maximum capacity of its gigantic lungs, it is able to dive close to 10,000 feet below the surface. Optionally by puffing itself up, it can float high on the ocean surface or beach on a shoreline if it wishes.</description>

<description>Solrock resembles a large orange spherical rock with yellow outgrowths all around and a pair of flat, textured eyes. The appearance of the Pokémon is the iconic shape of the sun.
Solrock, apparently a meteorite whose origins appear to be from outer space, is expressionless, yet is somewhat sentient. It was discovered along with Lunatone in Meteor Falls, a site where a rain of meteorites impacted the ground. The Pokemon`s solar connections are apparent in battle: It absorbs solar power during the day and unleashes the sunlight as a concentrated beam of energy as its main weapon (compare with Venusaur). Since it also carries Psychic powers, Solrock can also sense what the foe is thinking. Solrock and Lunatone are counterparts. Lunatone represents the moon and Solrock represents the sun.</description>

<description>Snorunt live in icy dark caves and enjoys crying out to hear its own echo. Its diet consists solely of snow and ice. Old folklore claims that a house visited by Snorunt is sure to prosper for many generations to come. It generally moves in groups of five Snorunt, and they hide away during the hot seasons of Summer and Spring. Being an Ice-type, Snorunt can withstand temperatures of up to negative 150 degrees. Also, it has the peculiar ability to make Winter come early. A Snorunt typically evolves into a Glalie at level 42, but if a Snorunt is female and a player uses a Dawn Stone on it, it will evolve into a Froslass.
In the Pokémon anime, Snorunt is Ash Ketchum`s fifth Pokémon from the Hoenn region. It has a powerful Ice Beam, though this is hindered by Snorunt`s bad aim. Because of this, Ash constantly trains it to try and improve its use of the technique. Snorunt eventually evolves into Glalie while fighting Team Rocket.</description>

<description>Spheal is a spherical creature that rolls across ice floes because its body isn`t cut out for swimming. Spheal, in spite of its infancy, is fully capable of living in Arctic environments such as a tundra. Though it is not obvious, its body is fully covered in a layer of plushy fur that feels fluffy to the touch. This is surprisingly good at insulating Spheal against the cold when it is rolling about on ice floes or diving into the sea, for it apparently never feels the cold at all. When groups of Spheal eat, they instinctively show their pleasure by clapping and making other noises.</description>

<description>Sealeo lives in herds among the ice floes of Arctic regions, and these herds consist of both itself and its other evolutionary forms Spheal and Walrein. Its flippers are quite powerful: they are strong enough to shatter ice with well-placed flaps. Five times a day, Sealeo dives into the sea to hunt prey.
Sealeo`s behavior revolves mostly around its sensitive nose; Sealeo uses it to investigate new things. It lifts new objects up with its nose, and rolls them around. While rolling an object, Sealeo checks the object`s aroma and texture in order to learn about it. This is what it does to differentiate food from anything else, making it a vital ability for survival. However, Sealeo also takes a liking to balancing and spinning a younger Spheal on its nose for entertainment.</description>

<description>Walrein is among the few fully-evolved Pokemon that live in functional communities, down in glacial environments, made of members of its pre-evolved forms Spheal and Sealeo as well as itself. The Walrein are the dominant members of their society, protecting their groups from attackers with their large strong tusks. These tusks are strong enough to thoroughly shatter blocks of ice weighing ten tons. When alone in the Arctic seas, Walrein`s thick blubber insulates it from the extreme cold of sub-zero temperature water, and it uses its tusks to clear its way as it swims through ice floes. The blubber is also resilient enough to make enemy attacks such as bites bounce off relatively harmlessly.</description>

<description>Snover is a "frosted tree Pokémon," that first appeared in the 4th generation of Pokémon. Snover is a small, tree-like Pokémon that appears mid to late game. On its head it has a white hat-like structure resembling a mountain with three peaks.
In the spring, frozen candy-like berries grow around its stomach which are similar to frozen treats. Because of its lack of human contact, Snover is known to be boldly inquisitive. Male and female Snover vary in appearance by their stomach`s pattern, with the male having an extra brown zigzag. Snover, and its evolution Abomasnow, is a unique Grass/Ice type, giving it many different abilities than most Grass or Ice types. Its Grass/Ice combination, unfortunately, makes it weak against Fire types, Fighting types, Poison types, Flying types, Bug types, Rock types, and Steel types. On the plus side, the Grass/Ice combination makes Snover and its evolutionary form, Abomasnow, strong against Water types, Electric types, Grass types, and Ground types.
The ability Snow Warning is also unique to Snover`s line, and causes the weather to change to hail when Snover is brought into battle. This hail does not disappear over time, but must be overridden by another weather changing move or ability.</description>

Its ability, Snow Warning, creates an everlasting hailstorm that grants its strongest attack, Blizzard, perfect accuracy. It can be found on the peak of Mt. Coronet and is the strongest Pokemon levelwise used by the seventh Gym Leader of Snowpoint City, Candice on Pokemon Diamond &amp; Pearl.</description>

<description>Glaceon, known as the Fresh Snow Pokémon, is one of two evolutions of Eevee that is obtained from training it in a certain location, the other evolution being Leafeon. The location necessary to evolve Eevee into Glaceon is on route 217 in the Sinnoh region. There is an ice covered rock here, but it is also possible to level up anywhere in grass on route 217 to evolve. Being an ice-type, it prefers cold climates, and as a protective measure it freezes its fur completely. This freezing causes the hair to resemble "ice needles."
In the Anime, May`s Eevee evolved into a Glaceon prior to her reappearance in the episode 544 `Restaurant Seven Stars! Tag Battle for a Full Course!` and Bianca got a same Eevee and now evolved into Glaceon nicknamed Iceshocker.</description>

<description>Froslass, known as the Snow Land Pokémon, appears to be based on the Yuki-onna, a Japanese snow spirit, hence being a Ghost-type. It bears a humanoid appearance (unlike Snorunt or Glalie). Its main body color is white with a red stripe around the waist and two red fins on her back (designed to resemble a kimono obi). Froslass`s arms are attached to its head as opposed to its torso, and each has a three-fingered hand and a blue fin on the wrist (representing the sleeves of a kimono). The head is round except for a bump on the back and has a purple lower jaw. Two small blue "horns" made of ice are on Froslass`s head, along with a purple diamond-shaped crater in the center of its forehead. Froslass doesn`t have any feet, so it floats in the air like its counter-part, Glalie. Its torso appears to be hollow, as it is stated in the Pokédex`s entry for Froslass. A female Snorunt will evolve into Froslass after a Dawn Stone is used on it.
It attacks prey and unsuspecting victims in icy snowstorms, where its Snow Cloak ability allows it to go unseen (yuki-onna are said to have skin so pale that they can actually blend into their snow-covered surroundings). To render its foes and victims helpless, it blows an icy wind that can reach as low as -60˚F. Its head has a slight resemblance to Celebi`s.
A Froslass appears in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness, as a dangerous and obsessive Pokémon, who is attracted to the famous explorer Scizor, who doesn`t exactly return those affections. As a result, she kidnaps him and freezes him in ice. But when the player and partner intervene, Frosslass is stopped.</description>

<description>Meowth is a very unique Pokémon as it has many of the characteristics of a human. It walks on two feet, talks and is as smart as any human. Meowth is currently a member of Team Rocket and he travels around with Jessie and James trying to capture Pikachu and other rare Pokémon for Giovanni.
Meowth generally finishes his sentences with "Nyaa (ニャー)" which is the equivalent of "meow" in English. This helps people remember that despite his ability to talk like a human, he still has cat character traits.
Meowth is also known for coming up with his many schemes to try to capture Pikachu. While Jessie and James always agree with Meowth and think his plans are brilliant, they are generally foiled by Ash and his friends.
Long Con to Access Raimon City Pokémon Center
Meowth schemed with Jessie, James and Doctor Zager to figure out a way for them to infiltrate the Raimon City Pokémon Center where high-leveled Pokémon are stored in a vault that is protected by a security machine scan system that would only open if Nurse Joy (Isshu) or Nurse Joy`s Audino were scanned. Meowth pretended to be no longer part of Team Rocket making up a story that his made an error while executing a certain operation and when headquarters hear of his mistake, they told him he was fired.
Ash, Iris and Cilan believed him and allowed Meowth to travel with him. Pikachu though didn`t trust Meowth even though Meowth proved on numerous occasion that it should be trusted. Meowth`s plan was put into action when they arrived at the Raimon City Pokémon Center and as soon as Nurse Joy`s Audino was scanned to open the door, Meowth turned on Pikachu and the other and captured all the Pokémon in the vault. The long con had been a success and Meowth met up with Jessie and James below the Pokémon Center. Unfortunately, they weren`t able to get away as Ash and his friends realized that Meowth had just been conning them and they were able to stop Team Rocket.</description>

<description>The Beginning
On the morning that Ash was to start his Pokémon journey, he woke up late and by the time he reached Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory, all of the beginner Pokémon were already taken. However, Professor Samual Oak did have one Pokémon left, a wild Pikachu. At first, Pikachu did not like Ash and would refuse to enter his PokéBall. He would often laugh at Ash`s failures and refused to listen to him. However, after Ash proved his loyalty to Pikachu by protecting him from a flock of Spearow, and thus began to earn Pikachu`s trust and respect. The two have since become best friends and Pikachu never leaves Ash`s side.
Since the day Team Rocket first encountered Pikachu, it has been their sole goal to capture it. Day after day, their plan to capture Pikachu has been thwarted mainly due to Pikachu`s amazingly powerful Thunderbolt that keeps on blasting them off.
On numerous occasions, Pikachu has made it evident that he is happy being a Pikachu and has no desire to evolve into a more powerful Raichu. It has proven time and time again that it is a powerful and worthy opponent to any Pokémon that dares to battle it.
Gym Battle against Burgh`s Leavanny
Pikachu was then sent out to battle Burgh`s Leavanny. Burgh`s Leavanny managed to tie up Pikachu with String Shot but unlike Ash`s Swadloon who was able to break free, Pikachu ended up getting hit with a couple of Leaf Storm attacks and a Hyper Beam before it rolled into another of Burgh`s Leavanny`s Leaf Storm attacks to break the string off its body so it could attack. Freed from the String Shot, Burgh`s Leavanny tried to tie it up again but Pikachu managed to avoid it with its speed and then knocked Burgh`s Leavanny out with a combination of Iron Tail and Electro Ball.
Gym Battle against Elesa
Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy and was then matched up with Pikachu. Pikachu made quick work of Elesa`s Emolga and knocked it out with one attack, its Iron Tail.
Elesa`s Tynamo was the last Pokémon that she used in her gym battle against Ash. It was matched up against Pikachu who had just defeated her Emonga. Pikachu had a hard time defending against the fast Tackle attack that Elesa`s Tynamo kept hitting it with but Pikachu used its Thunderbolt to create a large dust cloud leaving only a small corridor for Pikachu to focus on it and so Elesa`s Tynamo couldn`t maneuver out of the way. Pikachu one hit K.O`d Elesa`s Tynamo with a Iron Tail. The loss gave Ash the overall victory.
Battle against Alder`s Bouffalant
Ash challenged Alder to a battle and he accepted though he had been walking all night and was actually quite tired. Alder sent out his Buffron to battle Pikachu but just as the battle started, Alder fell asleep standing up and didn`t give any orders to his Buffron. Alder`s Bouffalant stood still as Pikachu began hitting it with attack after attack until it Alder`s Bouffalant finally got mad at Alder and charged at him and set him flying into a tree. After that, Alder`s Bouffalant no longer wished to battle and Alder conceded the battle.
Gym Battle against Skyla
In Skyla air battle simulation, Ash`s Tranquill was matched up against Skyla`s Unfezant and since her Pokémon was the highest evolved form, she determined that her Pokémon would be the winner in that match-up. In the actual gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was up against Skyla`s Unfezant which was the match-up just after Ash`s Tranquill had defeated Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla`s Unfezant proved to be stronger and faster than Ash`s Tranquill, so Ash recalled it and set out Pikachu. Pikachu had a definite advantage over Skyla`s Unfezant with its electric attacks and it quickly knocked it out with its Electro Ball attack.
Ash Just after Pikachu ended up knocking out Skyla`s Unfezant, Skyla`s Swanna was sent out to battle against it. Skyla had been watching her grandpa`s battle videos and noticed that he used the move Aqua Ring to defend against Electric attacks. She used that same defense against Pikachu which nullified its Electric attacks. It`s Iron Tail also couldn`t hit it so high in the air. Ash then noticed the rings in the air and Pikachu jumped up on them and managed to hit Skyla`s Swanna but not directly. Pikachu was now up in the air though and Skyla`s Swanna had the advantage there and it quickly knocked Pikachu out with a powerful Brave Bird attack.

Pikachu participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where it is was matched up against Trip`s Serperior. Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter its speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round.</description>

<description>While Wobbuffet is technically Jessie`s Pokémon, it has been around so long that it has become a main character, appearing in almost every episode of the series since it debut.
Wobbuffet was first seen walking around with Benny, his previous trainer. Jessie traded her Lickitung for Wobbuffet and it has been with her ever since that day.
Wobbuffet rarely battles but when he does, his Counter and Mirror Coat moves have proved to be very effective. Unfortunately, Jessie`s tactics aren`t always sufficient to master Wobbuffet`s superior defensive skills.
Wobbuffet also randomly comes out of his Pokeball, especially during the Team Rocket motto. He is also seen blasting off with Jessie regardless if he was actually part of the action.</description>

<description>When Ash and co. were traveling towards Daybreak Town for Dawn`s next Pokémon Contest, a mysterious Pokémon Trainer specializing in martial arts, named Clayton, challenged Ash and his Buizel to a battle after seeing how Buizel saved Gible who had fallen into a river. Clayton`s Mr. Mime proved to be a really strong opponent, though, as it managed to dodge Buizel`s Aqua Jet and SonicBoom attacks by skillfully using its Psychic and Double Team moves, eventually knocking Buizel out with a powerful ThunderPunch. Ash and Buizel, determined to make up for the loss by getting stronger, started training with Clayton`s help so that Buizel could learn a new move; Ice Punch. He told them that, in order to master the move, they had to work on improving their speed and concentration.
At first, the progress of Ash`s Buizel`s training seemed to be really slow. However, after training overnight using unstable and light objects as targets for its punches, like floating leaves, Buizel managed to master the move completely. After the completion of Buizel`s training, Ash challenged Clayton to a rematch, and Clayton accepted. Ash`s Buizel proved to be more of a challenge for its opponent, Mr. Mime, this time and after activating its ability, Swift Swim, in the midst of the battle due to a sudden rain, Buizel managed to increase its speed and finish Clayton`s Mr. Mime off with a powerful Ice Punch. Clayton then acknowledged Ash`s Buizel`s improvement and praised its skills, but also put emphasis on the fact that Buizel still had a long way to go and had to keep on training.</description>
