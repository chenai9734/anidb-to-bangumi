<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="16970">I have to agree with the other comments here; the lack of episodes had quite the negativ impact on the story, which on the other hand contained some truly unique and interesting setting... lots of wasted potential in this department.
Even one of the otherwise good fighting scenes was just cut at the end.
So everything feels rushed and confusing which makes it hard to keep up with the already thinned out story.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="326975">Good premise, but poor execution. Plot is rushed, the animation is the worst of the season, and the characters are too one-dimensonal. Only watch it if you don`t have high expectations.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="283829">Sadly, the interesting premise of the show ended up being little more than a facade for a generic shonen flick. Some well animated scenes are the only thing redeemable about this anime, it wasted many eps on meaningless battles, built up one heck of a confusing pseudostory and never cared to elaborate on any of it. The rushed ending also created more questions than it solved. Sadly, it`s still one of the better shows of the spring 2011 season</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="124759">It`s just the best for 11 episodes. You think it was too rush? Don`t you think the finance is rush everyday? Rush is good! Rush is must to be! The more the worse. No `potention` for any longer run. It should be done asap! Best plot anime of early 2011.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="13451">Wonderfully deep and asks some real questions.  Who`d have thought that finance and economics could form the basis of a great series?</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="96822">New concept of story, battles a little meh but overall good till now.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="339155">The first half was really good, but i felt like the ending as rushed to much..

Still a good watch if your looking for something new</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="252817">26 or more episodes crammed in to 11. An obviously high budget anime cut short to the point of confusing the watcher.

Great animation and style, don`t bother if you`re looking for a deep story.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="292763">Ended too fast = Storyline get mess up + confusing and too many unresolves. I don`t know why they decide to end it at episode 11. This kind of anime should around 26+ episodes. Honestly what a waste for a completely original anime. Hope entire production staffs commit suppeku for ignorance!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="17039">Thats something. They try to put financial crisis into a anime. Fine. But they don`t get the idea what causes it, don`t they? I mean, just making people or landscapes disappear just isn`t what happends if you blow up a economy by gambling. There are, however, some interesting points. The main-character is a pretty good guinea-pig for all this. Since the story is limited to 11 eps the climax is about to come. I admit i`m quite curious what it will be: crap or brilliant?</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="204142">A supernatural take on the ups and downs typical to economic systems, with a political backdrop of the current Great Depression, utilizing a number of the main actors and movers thereof, the IMF, the World bank, and the Federal Reserve via the US. The effects of fiat currency, the Midas note (read Federal Reserve note), a debt-based system, the use of an inflationary-deflationary model, and ultimately the will to use such to subjugate every aspect of peoples` present and futures leading to only which can be called world domination.

While a number of morals arise, primary to the current global situation and the story backdrop is the utter fallibility of fiat currency, and the dangers posed by the ultimate agenda of those who would make it and those insipid enough to indebted themselves to it. It`s a fun vision of an otherwise mundane, and yet critical aspect of everyday life.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="80989">Good show, but it really crumpled. 7 is fair rating.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="470260">Nice plot</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="498834">Very underrated in my opinion. This anime has amazing animation, great OST, awesome story concept. Now the bad the characters arnt really memorable and only 11eps if this had more i`m sure it would had been a lot better</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="428534">I was a little put off at first because of the proxy battle aspect but its actually a very good watch, one of the few animes airing currently that I am keeping up on instead of just waiting for Blu-ray</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="310513">Simply failed quite to live up to what could have been a very interesting idea. Not only was the idea not improvised and explained properly, the series was rushed. Final Verdict: The show could have been 10 times better if idea was utilized properly.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="482526">That anime have the potencial to be really great but why only 11 eps :( It easyly can have at least 30 eps with a plot like that ... Anyway the plot is superb but it should`ve been expressed in more series !</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="473284">If your looking for a good, imaginitive, anime that sucks you in from the very first episode, this is for you! Though it gets sort of confusing towards the end, so you may have to re-watch a few episodes to understand things.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="248024">Good series, very short only 11 episodes. Primary characters are developed enough for the plot. Very adult themes about money and economics with a trainer/summon dynamic. All in all a good watch was entertained the whole way through worth the time.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="121404">Amazing. #1 anime this season by far.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="151437">This is my second time recommending an anime(been here since 2006)

MUST SEE!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="503773">surprisingly good!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="374795">Absolutely fantastic and addictive. Don`t miss it !</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="456503">I believe the point of this anime was to show how the monetary system and corruption can bring our world to ruin and destroy our futures. If it had of been longer than 11 episodes I believe that point could have been easily misconstrued or detracted from by a longer series. If you`ve seen the Zeitgeist films or EndGame - Blueprint For Global Enslavement, and you enjoy anime; this is a MUST WATCH for you!</recommendation>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Since college/university students are typically at least eighteen years old, with stories covering mature everyday life topics, you will find the college setting quite often in seinen and josei anime.
Topics that can now be covered - as compared to High School settings - are higher education (i.e. coping with higher intellectual stress), the more adult party life (i.e. alcohol, smoking, sex), the issues of daily life vs. studying - especially when having to work to pay for bills, and finally the possible friction between those in and out of college.</description>

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<description>The conspiracy thriller (or paranoid thriller) is a sub-genre of the thriller which flourished in the 1970s in the US (and was echoed in other parts of the world) in the wake of a number of high-profile scandals and controversies (most notably Vietnam, the assassination of President Kennedy, Chappaquiddick and Watergate), and which exposed what many people regarded as the clandestine machinations and conspiracies beneath the orderly fabric of political life.
The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top".</description>

<name>dystopia</name>
<description>A dystopia (from Ancient Greek: δυσ-, "bad, ill", and Ancient Greek: τόπος, "place, landscape"; alternatively cacotopia, or anti-utopia) is, in literature, an often futuristic society that has degraded into a repressive and controlled state, often under the guise of being utopian. Dystopian literature has underlying cautionary tones, warning society that if we continue to live how we do, this will be the consequence. A dystopia, thus, is regarded as a sort of negative utopia and is often characterized by an authoritarian or totalitarian form of government. Dystopias usually feature different kinds of repressive social control systems, a lack or total absence of individual freedoms and expressions and constant states of warfare or violence. Dystopias often explore the concept of humans abusing technology and how humans individually and collectively cope with technology that has evolved too quickly such as the car, the flamethrower or the microwave. A dystopian society is also often characterized by widespread poverty and brutal political controls such as a large military-like police.</description>

<description>In the strict sense the Coming of age describes a young person`s transition from adolescence to adulthood.

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

<name>noitaminA</name>
<description>noitaminA (ノイタミナ) – Animation written backwards – is a Fuji Television programming block, devoted to anime, broadcast each Thursday night from 00:45 to 1:15. It was launched with the intention of expanding the target audience beyond the typical young male demographic.
The timeslot was expanded from half an hour to a full hour in 2010, and now airs Thursday nights from 00:45 to 1:45.
noitaminA aired its first non-anime series in 2010, with the premiere of the live-action adaptation of Moyashimon. On April 15, 2010, Fuji TV and FUNimation announced an agreement that allows FUNimation to simulcast series from the noitaminA block in North America within an hour of their airing in Japan.</description>

<name>be careful what you wish for</name>
<description>Be careful what you wish for... your wish may actually come true. This is an age-old philosophical problem of what human beings think they want and what is actually good for them. The power to wish for anything can be very dangerous and usually — as a moral lesson — yields unexpected / unwanted results.
A contract with the devil is a specific case of this; receiving great power, especially from a devil, is usually a double edged sword.</description>

<name>butchered foreign languages</name>
<description>In this anime, some characters "speak" foreign languages, successfully making the audience`s ears bleed. That is especially true if the viewer is a native speaker of or otherwise proficient in the languages in question.
The foreigners in the show do not seem to take much notice of the fact that their supposed native languages are being massacred. In fact, oftentimes they also actively participate in the butchering of said languages. That happens, of course, because they, too, are voiced by Japanese people without knowledge of the language they`re supposed to speak, or to pretend to speak at any rate.</description>

<name>cosmic reset</name>
<description>All events that occurred up to a certain point are mysteriously undone, as if the Universe pressed a rewind button. This usually means some characters are being given another chance to unknowingly play out events differently, perhaps to prevent certain consequences from the previous time line`s actions. Occasionally they become doomed to repeat portions of their life over and over again until an individual event or series of events are performed correctly in just the right way, as seemingly to gain the Universe`s approval.</description>

<name>Engrish</name>
<description>Engrish is actually a mispronunciation of English, as can be the result of someone, who does not have English as their primary language of origin (such as Japanese or Chinese). Occasionally characters in the original Japanese dialogue version of an anime will speak in English... however; this often still requires the assistance of subtitles, for while the words are meant to be said in English, the sentence structure and letter pronunciation may still be strongly related to the person’s primary language.</description>
