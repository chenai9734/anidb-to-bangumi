<description>In the time of the Tang Dynasty, a monk, Sanzou Houshi, travels to India to obtain copies of important Buddhist texts that are not yet available in China. In the beginning of his journey, he is accompanied by Son Gokuu, The Monkey King, who has a shape-changing ability and a fast-travelling skill, and owns a handy, resizable cudgel. While travelling, the two meet Cho Hakkai, The Pig Monster, who joins Sanzou Houshi`s pilgrimage to atone for his sins. Later, the now party of three encounters Sa Gojou, The River Monster, who also ends up joining them to atone for his sins. In the meantime, numerous adversaries wait in ambush for a chance to sabotage the party`s long, harsh journey.

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>
