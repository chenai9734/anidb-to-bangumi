<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="318709">Nice anime. Great story but the drawing is only half goog. The live action is the best. Great for sport fans</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="84224">Terrible art. unlikable characters, choppy animation. and a story that has been done better in most sport anime. only for fans</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="348650">The ping pong The animation anime team has done something truly amazing. They took a story that would be other wise boring and completely deviated from today`s animation standard and made a complete masterpiece in 11 episodes. At first I was very skeptical of how good a sports anime would be with only 11 episodes, but they sure know how to tell a story.

That`s the selling point of this anime; the storytelling and execution were incredible.

More than a anime about table tennis, this is a story about change, moving on, giving it your all, friendship, and the hardships that come with them.

Truly a beautiful piece of work.

Recommended to anyone who enjoys all kinds of anime, those people who can see a diamond before it is a diamond.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="503983">Great storyline and nice ending. Animation is unique and fits to the story. Love the music.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="572635">This can be place among best anime series.. The art style, animation, character design as well as overall directions has been done in superb way.. If you have not watched it yet then watch it. you won`t regret it..</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="119177">another great work by taiyou matsumoto. his unmistakeable style (just like in tekkon kinkreet) may seem weird at first but it can grow on you, especially since it`s a welcome change from the usual monotony.
unlike the unnecessary superficial mainstream bullshit, this show is pure and actually watchable even though the theme is table tennis. i haven`t felt that way about an anime for a long time.
check it out if you`re tired of being fed shitty plots with cliche characters, big guns, explosions and almost naked chicks (there`s porn for that).
with one outs, detroit metal city and eve no jikan, 2008 was the last year with any bearable material,
when 2007 had kaiji, sword of the stranger, byousoku 5 centimeter and nodame cantabile.
2006 had bartender, DEATH NOTE, ergo proxy, tekkon kinkreet.
the further you go into the past - the more good stuff you find.
lately every anime`s categories include: action, ecchi, harem, big breasts, martial arts, pantsu. i don`t watch that shit.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="590343">One of the best animes to be released in YEARS, if not ever. Seriously. As a whole, this anime is bordering on perfect. It is dense, emotional, heart-pounding intense at times, GORGEOUS to watch, metaphorical, literal, existential, realist. 

The hyper-stylized animation is seriously gorgeous, and rich with vivid imagery and cutaways between the immaculate action sequences (ping pong matches) and intriguing, well-developed character drama.

The protagonists are deep, wounded, and struggling. They are real human beings, struggling with self-doubt, fear, repressed memories, aspirations, limitations, devastating failure, and empty triumph. 

This anime, despite the surreal animation, feels so. Genuinely. Real.

This will be the first anime I ever buy on blu-ray when it is released, and probably one of the first anime on my list when I recommend shows to people looking to get into anime themselves.

Watch it. It will change something in you.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="561560">This show was the biggest positive surprise of 2014 for me. A totally unique anime, which focuses on character development and not so much on Ping Pong or table tennis as the title suggests. The sport is just a vehicle for friendship, rivalry, emotions and character growth. One of the best parts is the realistic ending.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="613777">It is much more than a sport anime. It is epic, pure, and brilliant. Get out of your comfort zone and give this one a shot.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="194756">A Full package, fantastic direction, soundtrack, animation and characters. Easily one of the best series ive ever seen.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="57112">This is a really fun and original sports anime unlike any I`ve seen before, but that`s not a bad thing. Very unique animation style that has to be seen. Voice work is top notch and characters are interesting. Definitely one of the top new shows of spring 2014.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="564240">A truly interesting sports anime despite only with 11 episodes. Its relatively fast paced indeed and it doesn`t serve up an over complicated plot points.

Some say in terms of art and animation, its poorly executed. The art is simply refreshing and different to me. Probably its not as drastic as you think though. That`s why, it does have effect of realism and weirdness in the art. Thus, it has an unique animation style.

In short, the story is a little deeper about talent and the desire to overcome one of the sports out there, especially table tennis. The character development are very intriguing although it feels like one-dimensional. I do like the way they portrayed along the ride. Such a realistic human being drama.

In the end, the fans definitely will find something an enjoyable and entertaining out of this show.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="660321">Quite possibly the greatest coming-of-age and sports anime ever produced, and is a perfect length of 11 episodes so it can be watched easily in under 5 hours</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="384413">I don`t like ping pong, but gosh darn it, ping pong has never been so good!

Ping Pong has a certain charm about it that many anime lack which makes it really compelling to watch, and very enjoyable and satisfying in the long run, mainly thanks to its great directing by Yuasa Masaaki.

And this isn`t just about ping pong, but also about the characters and their journey to come in terms with themselves, which serves as great development, which gives it an edge over the majority of all sports anime out there.

Apart from feeling a tad shorter than what it could`ve been, it`s a satisfying story with a satisfying ending - it`s a definite must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="672527">Great anime. Everything is impeccably done: beautiful story, very good character development (especially when the anime is only this short), fitting modern soundtrack. The animation is very unique, some might find it offputting but when lately almost every anime is animated the same, this feels refreshing.

It is about ping pong, but you shouldn`t put it in the same category as sports-shounens. This one doesn`t rely on the old archetypical story where everything is cliche. It is completely unique.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="563093">Yuasa Masaaki is quickly becoming one of my favorite anime directors, once again showcasing his unique and interesting style in Ping Pong the Animation. In this series—like many previous titles—he`s working together with Itou Nobutake, and the result is just outstanding. 

The amazing part about Ping Pong is it`s ability to take an unoriginal, simple story and make it something fresh and exciting. The incredible artwork, interesting characterization and engaging direction can`t be described as anything less than masterful.
  
Personally I`m not too happy about the state of anime in 2014 but this is the kind of series that keeps my hope up. I`m definitely looking forward to seeing more of Yuasa and I`m hoping that he`ll continue to work with Itou in the future.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="382591">Extraordinary visuals!</recommendation>

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Even though school clubs in Japan are not mandatory, there is some pressure from the social grid (e.g. fellow students, teachers) to participate in some kind of after-school activity, be it in sports or arts. Colleges also have clubs.
As a comedy element in anime, some students have joined too many clubs, and are thus constantly stressed out. There is also the element of social commentary, making it clear that you have to join a club, if you want to be part of the class. Since self-founded clubs need at least 3 members, the desperate search and advertising for new members can be cause for hilarity in anime.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>Table tennis (also called ping pong) is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball back and forth using a table tennis racket. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, players must allow a ball played toward them only one bounce on their side of the table and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side. Points are scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions.

<name>noitaminA</name>
<description>noitaminA (ノイタミナ) – Animation written backwards – is a Fuji Television programming block, devoted to anime, broadcast each Thursday night from 00:45 to 1:15. It was launched with the intention of expanding the target audience beyond the typical young male demographic.
The timeslot was expanded from half an hour to a full hour in 2010, and now airs Thursday nights from 00:45 to 1:45.
noitaminA aired its first non-anime series in 2010, with the premiere of the live-action adaptation of Moyashimon. On April 15, 2010, Fuji TV and FUNimation announced an agreement that allows FUNimation to simulcast series from the noitaminA block in North America within an hour of their airing in Japan.</description>

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

Depending on the type of tournament, contestants will either act alone, be permitted a team, or construct a team of chance throughout the ongoing competition.</description>

<name>mundane made awesome</name>
<description>Sometimes normal just doesn`t cut it. Eating: you put food in your mouth and chew. Playing sports: you throw a ball around. You need to make it awesome, no matter how mundane it is.
Let`s throw in some gripping orchestral music, lighting changes, different camera angles, something! Don`t write like a man, write like an evil overlord! Exaggerate your expressions and gestures, speak with excessive intonation, and if all else fails, throw in some close-ups, slow motion, and ominous Latin chanting! With practice, even you can turn something like eating chips into an epic battle of light and dark, blinding the viewer with sheer awesomeness.

<name>Engrish</name>
<description>Engrish is actually a mispronunciation of English, as can be the result of someone, who does not have English as their primary language of origin (such as Japanese or Chinese). Occasionally characters in the original Japanese dialogue version of an anime will speak in English... however; this often still requires the assistance of subtitles, for while the words are meant to be said in English, the sentence structure and letter pronunciation may still be strongly related to the person’s primary language.</description>

<name>the power of love</name>
<description>The power of love is not only the strongest power known to mankind, it is the strongest power in the universe. The power of love conquers all things. It makes people cry, it makes people laugh, it can make them sing and occasionally it even brings dead people back to life, just so.
More so than the power of friendship, the power of true love gives boundless strength and resolution; by the power of love every hardship can be overcome, every issue can be resolved and it does make people resistant to food poisoning (caused by the bad cooking of their loved ones). Even the big bad evil doesn`t stand a chance against the power of true love and often ends up redeemed.
Even when the power of love is not literally and directly responsible, the scene is often set so that the audience is left with the impression that it was "really responsible".</description>

<description>Many anime are created as part of larger projects encompassing many shows without direct relation to one another. Normally, there is a specific idea in mind: for example, the http://anidb.net/t4859 [Young Animator Training Project] aims to stimulate the on-the-job training of next-generation professionals of the anime industry, whereas the http://anidb.net/t3763 [World Masterpiece Theatre] aims to animate classical stories from all over the world.</description>
