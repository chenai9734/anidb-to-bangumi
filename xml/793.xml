<description>* Based on the novel with same name written by http://anidb.net/cr17073 [Yoshihara Rieko].
The story combines science fiction, aestheticism and yaoi. Ai no Kusabi focuses on the love and conflict between 3 main characters, http://anidb.net/ch25159 [Iason Mink], http://anidb.net/ch25160 [Riki] and http://anidb.net/ch25161 [Guy]. The background takes place in a future computer-controlled society on the planet of Amoy and focuses on Riki, a resident of the Ceres slums. In the capital city of Tanagura where the elite class is divided into different ranks that are based on their hair colours, elites are allowed to keep slaves as pets to perform sexual acts for their voyeurism entertainment and are forbidden to interact sexually with them. Iason, the highest of elites, has forced Riki to become his pet and is obsessed with keeping Riki for himself. Riki keeps this secret of his former lover, Guy. Riki is unsure of whether he should continue to resist Iason or surrender to him.

Note: The story ran as series on a famous Japanese shounen ai magazine, Shousetsu June (No. 22 December 1986 to No. 27 October 1987). The story then was slightly reedited by the author and has been published as a hard-cover book since 1990.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<description>Shounen Ai means boys love, and thus explores what happens when two boys (or men) fall in love. This is not to be mistaken for http://anidb.net/t2723 [Yaoi] which is (or, at least, how this term is often used by the western audience) used in adult works. This is not; that means there is no graphical sex.
The female version is http://anidb.net/t2782 [Shoujo Ai].</description>

<name>bondage</name>
<description>Bondage is the use of restraints for the sexual pleasure of the parties involved. It may be used in its own right, as in the case of rope bondage and breast bondage, or as part of sexual activity or BDSM activity. When a person is sexually aroused by bondage, it may be considered a paraphilia, known as vincilagnia (from Latin vincio, to bind or fetter with chains, and lagneia, lust).

<description>Iason is not just any Blondie - he is the most perfect, superior and powerful of all of them, the one who talks directly with Jupiter and carries out Jupiter`s commands. He is the head of the Syndicate, Tanagura`s black market for pet trade. He is in love with Riki, a mongrel from the slums, which casts a literally dark shadow over his seeming perfection. Iason becomes interested, obsessed, and finally falls in love with Riki. He has an elegant and calm manner that hides a passionate, ruthless and unforgiving nature. For Riki, Iason is willing to flaunt and break all taboos.</description>

<description>Riki, or "Riki the Dark" has been called the `charisma` of the slums. He was the leader of Bison, a gang in Ceres, and eventually became Iason Mink`s pet, which had a crushing effect to his human pride. Riki is proud, rebellious, fierce and defiant, but his experiences change him. Some men living in the slums feel he has lost his spark. He is torn between his pride and the feelings he has for Iason that he is unwilling to acknowledge.</description>
