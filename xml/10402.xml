<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="815148">Though I`d consider this close to standalone status if you want to watch it by itself, I must say, if you liked the first season, you`ll love Book of Circus. It`s everything the first season did well and just polished to perfection. The visuals are stunning, the soundtrack is sublime, the new characters are compelling, and the plot is consistently interesting. It`s a much easier watch than the original season and is much more fast paced.</recommendation>

<name>detective</name>
<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.

<description>Shotacon, sometimes shortened to shota, is a Japanese slang portmanteau of the phrase Shoutarou complex and describes an attraction to young boys, or an individual with such an attraction. Outside Japan, the term is less common and most often refers to a genre of manga and anime wherein pre-pubescent or pubescent male characters are depicted in a suggestive or erotic manner.
In a general sense, this is the same as http://anidb.net/t2566 [loli], just replace young girls with young boys.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>A circus is a company of performers that may include clowns, acrobats, trained animals, trapeze acts, musicians, hoopers, tightrope walkers, jugglers, unicyclists and other object manipulation and stunt-oriented artists. The term circus also describes the performance which has followed various formats through its 250 year modern history. 
Philip Astley is credited with being the father of the modern circus when he opened the first circus in 1768 in England. Early circuses were almost exclusively demonstrations of equestrian skills with a few other types of acts to link the horsemanship performances. Performances developed significantly through the next fifty years, with large scale theatrical battle reenactments becoming a significant feature. [...]

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Sebastian appears to be a youthful male with red-orange eyes and dark brown hair (black in the anime). He is typically dressed in a distinguished outfit consisting of black trousers, tailcoat, vest, tie and shoes with a white botton-down shirt. He wears white gloves that cover up the sign of his Faustian contract with Ciel Phantomhive, which is on his left hand. When they are off, it is shown that he has black fingernails, although it is unknown if this is their natural colour. He frequently carries a pocket watch as well. When in tutor mode, he also wears glasses, although it`s unknown if he actually needs them or not. He slightly resembles Ciel`s father, and has had his attractiveness commented on before.
Sebastian`s demonic form has never fully been shown. Details including high-heeled boots, longer fingernails, slitted pupils and sharper, longer teeth are all that have been revealed. In the anime, he has the ability to transform into a crow, although this has never been said or implied in the manga.

<description>Ciel is a young male, whose age is from 12 to 13 throughout the series, with blue eyes and black hair. As the head of the noble Phantomhive family, he typically dresses in a way that suits his standing, including a long jacket, button-down shirt, tie, shorts, knee-high socks and boots. Occasionally, he carries other accessories such as a top hat, white or black gloves and a cane. He also has his ears pierced and frequently wears a one-of-a kind family ring that has been passed down through his family for generations. He nearly always wears an eye patch over his left eye, not because he is missing it, but because that`s where the sign of his Faustian contract with Sebastian Michaelis is hidden.
Occasionally, he wears other outfits, typically because he is undercover, investigating something at Queen Victoria`s request. These outfits have included a dress, when he invaded Aleister Chamber`s home, and pauper`s clothes, when he posed as a servant when joining the Noah`s Ark Circus.

<description>Grelle initially appears as a meek man with long, brown hair tied back with a red ribbon, yellow eyes and round glasses. He dresses in simple clothes to match his appearance.
However, it is later revealed that this is not his true appearance is that of a Shinigami. In his Shinigami form, he has long, red hair, yellow eyes, false eyelashes, razor-esque teeth and red-framed glasses with skulls dangling from chains on the frames. He also wears a suit including gloves and a tie, like the other Shinigami, high-heeled shoes, and a red coat, which he slings off his shoulders and wears around his elbows. Occasionally, his tie is replaced with a red-striped bow.
He seems to think highly of his appearance, as he is upset when Sebastian Michaelis attempts to hit him in the face, and he is distressed that he has to appear in his human form with the "out of vogue" brown hair and without make-up in front of others.

<description>Finnian, often called Finny, is the Phantomhive household gardener. However, it seems every time he tends to the garden, it is killed through an accident caused by his clumsiness and overenthusiastic pruning or not noticing that the pesticide container is leaking. In fact, if left to his own devices, he`s stated that he`d like to make the garden into the shape of a giant robot.</description>

<description>Maylene is a clumsy maid whose cracked glasses do nothing to improve her clumsiness. However, she refuses to purchase a new pair as they are the first thing Ciel bought for her. Sebastian believes her main problem is her intelligence and not her poor eyesight. She has a crush on Sebastian as blushes when ever she is in his presence and is even clumsier when Sebastian is watching. In the anime she fantasizes about being close to him in episode 1. She is rather superstitious but admits to having a soft spot for scary stories. Maylene used to be a sniper who did not use a scope, due to her sharp far-sighted vision caused by her ill-fitting glasses. She is also physically fit as she can use a sniper rifle like a hand gun and keeps hundreds loaded at once to decrease reload time. At the anime`s conclusion, it is unknown whether she is alive or dead, although it is noted she was breathing before she collapsed.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Tanaka is the house steward who has served under the former Master Phantomhive. He was present when Ciel`s parents were killed and was stabbed in the back during the incident and as a result, rarely does any work or even talking. Sebastian seems to respect him the most out of all the staff. He is usually seen drinking from a Japanese tea cup. Despite his appearance, Tanaka is capable of killing intruders. Prior to Sebastian`s appointment as Ciel`s butler, Tanaka served as the head butler of the Phantomhive household, for both Ciel`s father and Ciel; when Sebastian is apparently murdered, Ciel appoints Tanaka as the head butler again. In the anime, he is commonly in a super deformed form. When he is not, he is as capable a servant as Sebastian. As the series progresses, he is seen less often in a super deformed form.</description>

<description>Madame Red, born Angelina Durless, is Ciel`s aunt. As her title suggests, she is known for her red appearance and clothing. Initially she hated her red hair, which she inherited from her father, until Ciel`s father stated he liked it. Angelina fell in love with him and became distraught when she found her sister was marrying him. Madame Red later married Baron Barnett, who treats her lovingly and gently, stating that he does not mind that she harbors feelings for another. She obtained a medical license against the wishes of her parents and practices at the Royal London Hospital. After a carriage accident in which her husband was killed, her womb and unborn child had to be removed. This causes her great strife as a doctor because she regularly performs abortions on prostitutes as they believe having a child is troublesome. She later kills her patients with Grelle Sutcliffe and the two become known as Jack the Ripper. However, she cannot kill Ciel as she holds him as dear as her own son and because of this, she is killed by Grelle.</description>

<name>Lau</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Lau is a Chinese noble, President of the British Branch of a Chinese trading company, and friend to the Phantomhive family. He is also part of the Shanghai Mafia and runs an opium den. He is always smiling and his eyes are always closed except for brief moments in episodes fifteen and twenty. Lau often agrees to things before learning what is happening and jumps into conversations with helpful information only to later state he has no idea. He is also unaware his antics appear strange to others. However, he can be very coldblooded and cryptic and is willing to go further than Ciel would, such as having Lord West and his wife killed because he knew they`d try to cheat again. He is often seen with his personal assassin Ran-Mao, a Chinese, doll-like girl referred to as his sister, although not by blood. Although she very rarely speaks and is portrayed as emotionless, she is very loyal to him. In the anime adaption, Lau and Ran-mao are defeated by Ciel and Sebastian after they use the Earl`s company to store and sell Lady Blanc opium in the guise of candy. Lau and Ran-mao then throw themselves into the River Thames.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Prince Soma Asman Kadar is a sixteen-year-old Indian prince. Unlike Ciel, he is spoiled and uses his parent`s fortune for his personal needs and blames all of his problems on others. He bestowed his affections on Meena, a beautiful maidservant who had served at his palace in India since his birth. He saw her as an older sister. However, she came to hate him due to his arrogance and ran away to England with Lord Harold West, a trader in Indian goods, wanting to be a rich wife, rather than an ordinary cook bound to her social class. During the course of his time in England, Soma begins to see things in a different perspective, realizing that he is blaming problems he caused on others. After learning Meena hated him for his ignorance, Prince Soma decided to stay with Ciel and learn how to act as a gentleman and even proclaims to be Ciel`s best friend. He does not know that Meena and Lord West were both killed by Ranmao on Lau`s orders after they lost the curry contest and were planning to try again. Shortly after, Ciel has him and Agni manage his property in London, in order to keep them out of his way.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Agni is the servant of Prince Soma, whom he sees and worships as a god. Agni was once a nobleman named Arshad (in Indonesia: Arsyad) who used his powers and wealth for his own desires to the point that he was to be hanged for his crimes. Before he was to die, Prince Soma offered him a new life with the death of his old self. He is able to fight on a par with Sebastian while using a fencing foil, a feat which briefly makes Ciel wonder if he is a demon until Sebastian confirms he is a human. The source of his martial prowess comes from his devotion to Prince Soma. Unlike Sebastian, however, he is able to see the good in the Phantomhive manor staff and assign them tasks where their skills will be of use. He is known as the "Right Hand of God" for his god-like skill at making curry. He betrays Prince Soma and becomes the chef for a curry contest for Lord West to keep him from revealing to Soma that Meena ran away from and hated the prince. Later, Agni reconciles with the prince. He is staying in the Phantomhive manor to learn to become a better servant from Sebastian`s example, and even calls Sebastian his friend, something that surprises Sebastian as no one has ever referred to him as such before. Sebastian also takes Agni`s advice on taking care of Ciel, much to the younger boy`s annoyance.</description>

She has known Ciel for a long time and cares deeply for him, trying her best to see him smile again. Elizabeth would always tell Ciel to call her "Lizzy". She also loves cute things. Ciel sees her as an important friend and a girl that he needs to protect because he says that he does not want to lose anything important again. It has been shown a few times on how much Ciel cares for her, such as throwing himself in front of her to protect her from a bear in the manga, how he tried his best to save Elizabeth from Drocell, and also drying her tears after she broke his ring despite how upset he had been.</description>

<description>Queen Victoria is the Queen of the United Kingdom and has been described as having great beauty and grace. Despite this, she is a bit eccentric, this is seen when she enters a curry contest while riding a horse. After the death of her husband, she does not appear in public often and begins to cry hysterically whenever he is mentioned.
She nearly attempted suicide because of the grief over her dead husband until Ash approached her. Ash gave her youth and attached a part of her husband`s skin from her neck to her clavicle area. Because the skin continues to rot, it causes her great pain. When Ash tries to fix the problem, she refuses to let him. She also plays a villainous role, becoming part of the Organization for everlasting youth and being the one who ordered the destruction of the Phantomhive Family. She later dies and a look-alike is placed on the throne.</description>

At first, Abberline does not trust Ciel and his position as the Queen`s Watchdog, but later joins him as an ally. He is killed by Lau by using his body as a human shield to protect Ciel. His role in the manga adaptation is significantly shorter and he is portrayed with a moustache.</description>

<description>Ronald Knox is a Shinigami sent to work with William Spears as extra personnel.
Ronald appears to be a rather laid back, easy-going Shinigami, who apparently has problems with arriving on time. He seems interested in finding a way to accomplish his job quickly, as shown when he says he has never been one for overtime, and with ease, as shown when he wistfully tells William that Grell Sutcliff got to do an easier job. He also seems interested in partying, as he shares with William that he would like to finish a job quickly because he has a party to attend to afterward. His lackadaisical attitude seems to annoy William, but he does seem willing to work hard, as he states he will try his best. He also comes across as respectful, as he uses the senpai honorific when talking about Grell. He is also shown to be a ladies man, commenting he got his scythe legally modified by flirting with the receptionist.
Like the other Shinigami, Ronald has a death scythe used in his job. It has been modified to look like a lawnmower, which he states was done on the principle of avoiding overtime work.</description>
