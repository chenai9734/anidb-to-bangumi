<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="96490">Side story of Artemis needing a hero, and finding Bell in the hero zone. Lots of funny jealous moments with Hestia and company. Grreat music, good direction, very good character design, and a yummy Artemis who is probably the most seductive character Bell will encounter. Good entry to second season of DanMachi, which airs this summer.</recommendation>

<description>* Original story based on http://anidb.net/cr41113 [Oomori Fujino]`s light novel series.
Far from the dungeon beneath Orario rises a new threat, one the beautiful goddess http://anidb.net/ch98384 [Artemis] has sworn to destroy with the help of her chosen warrior. But this fighter isn`t the renowned http://anidb.net/ch70850 [Ais Wallenstein] or another storied hero of Orario legend. Instead the fate of Artemis` quest falls upon the shoulders of http://anidb.net/ch70852 [Bell Cranel], who must partner with the goddess and stand against the menace lurking in the remains of a distant, ancient city. Although Bell is the ordained champion of Artemis and a member of the goddess http://anidb.net/ch70851 [Hestia]`s familia, their adventure will test every skill and take every ounce of courage that Bell has — and perhaps, along the way, turn him into the hero he has always aspired to be.

<description>Lyu was born in an elven village deep inside a forest. However she was disgusted by the attitude of elves towards other races and left the village to reach Ontario a city full of opportunity. In the city she made friends with a female adventure that invited her to join Asteria familia, and also that she would call her Lyon since Lyu was to hard to say.
Lyu reached level 4 and specialised in using wind magic and sword fighting. She has a unique fighting technique that permits her to chant long spells while sword fighting. This style requires an enormous amount of concentration and Makoto even suggested that not even Aiz would be able to replicate such a feat. Her sword is made out of wood of a sacred tree.
Later Lyon solo survived the destruction of Astrea Familia during an ambush by an enemy famila, she asked her familia goddess to leave Ontario for her protection, however this was only an excuse since she didn`t want her goddess to witnessing her revenge.
She took revenge by killing every member of the rival familia and anyone connected with them resulting in the guild offering a bounty on her head.
After her revenge Lyon had no place to go, exhausted and injured was later saved by Syr, which asked her to join her in the staff of the Benevolent Mistress as a waitress. And changed back her name to Lyu.
Lyu sees Syr as her saviour and is totally dedicated in protecting her and helping her in her relationship with Bell.</description>
