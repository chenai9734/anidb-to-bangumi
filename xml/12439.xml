<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="257071">A summary of the series. Only adds a couple of small inconsequential scenes, with the rest of the content being exactly the same as the TV series, but with minor cuts here and there to speed it up a bit.

If you need a refresher before Overlord season 2, this is recommended for a marginally faster watch time, but otherwise the TV series is slightly preferable IMO (the opening sequence really grows on a person).</recommendation>

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<description>A novel is a relatively long work of narrative fiction, normally written in prose form, and which is typically published as a book. Manga, comics, or visual novels do not fit this description and are not considered novels; including a small number of illustrations, however, is still permissible, which means that light novels are considered novels.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>An antihero is a main character in a story who lacks conventional heroic qualities and attributes such as idealism, courage and morality. Although antiheroes may sometimes perform actions that are morally correct, it is not always for the right reasons, often acting primarily out of self-interest or in ways that defy conventional ethical codes.
A villain protagonist is where the leading character of the story (the protagonist) is also a villain; this is a fairly rare occurrence.</description>

<name>isekai</name>
<description>An isekai story is one in which the lead characters are transferred to and become stuck or trapped in another world, one completely different from the one they lived in up until the transfer. The new world is commonly a http://anidb.net/t2628 [fictional world], such as a http://anidb.net/t2838 [parallel world] or http://anidb.net/t2839 [virtual world] (other fictional world types can also apply). What defines the isekai genre is that the characters are sent to another world, often but not always a parallel one, and they generally cannot come back permanently without meeting a highly specific goal.
In order to adapt to their new environment, they must use the abilities and knowledge brought from their former world as well as any that may have been bestowed upon them by their brave new world. In some cases, they will seek and eventually find a way to return; in others, they will gleefully embrace their new life.
http://anidb.net/a144 [Inuyasha] is an example where isekai applies to a fictional world that is not also a parallel or virtual world. http://anidb.net/ch7246 [Higurashi Kagome] climbs down an ancient well at her grandfather`s shrine and is transported to feudal Japan (time travel). While she eventually gains the physical ability to travel back and forth between her time period and feudal Japan, her bonds and responsibilities to feudal Japan tie her there until they are ultimately resolved.
For clarity, below is an illustrative example where isekai is applied to a non-fictional, non-parallel, non-virtual world.

* The main characters are from Earth. One day, they are abducted by Nazis from Mars (alternate "world") are brought back to their Martian base. The main characters are trapped on Mars. Their only escape is to defeat the Nazis and steal their spaceship to return to Earth (specific goal required to escape); they are left to thier own devices, with no prospect of help from Earth, and no way to contact Earth.

<description>Cocytus is the Guardian of the 5th Floor of Nazarick.
Cocytus is the personal creation of Warrior Takemikazuchi, one of the 41 members of Ainz Ooal Gown. Cocytus was created to personify the perfect warrior both in body and spirit. Cocytus is loyal to a fault to the Supreme Beings but he`s not just a dumb muscle and is willing to learn in to better serve his lord. Amongst the denizen of Nazarick, he`s more accepting of outsiders provided they share the same strength, honor, and warrior spirit that he epitomizes.
Cocytus design is based on the Gelugon, a type of ice-devil from D&amp;D. He has the highest offensive capabilities of melee fighters in Nazarick backed up by ice-elemental skills. Cocytus have no need for armor as his exoskeleton serves as a living armor. His creator, Warrior Takemikazuchi, has equipped Cocytus with many of his own personally crafted weapons and has programmed Cocytus with the knowledge of all of the Divine Weapons own by the Supreme Beings.
Cocytus seems to prefer the company of other insectoids like him from Nazarick. He also hold good relations with Demiurge and often asks the demon for advice too difficult for himself to understand.</description>

Shalltear is the strongest of the floor guardians and is completely loyal to Ainz and is also a love rival to Albedo for his affections. She takes great joy in being able to prove her worth and fantasizes about the praise she expects to receive. When a situation doesn`t go in her favor, she panics about the scolding she believes that she will get.

<description>Demiurge is the Guardian of the 7th Floor of the Great Tomb of Nazarick.
Demiurge is the personal creation of Ulbert Alain Odle, one of the 41 members of Ainz Ooal Gown. Ulbert created Demiurge as the personification of evil. As such, Demiurge relish in acts that embodies this twisted morality scripted onto him. He is cruel and uniformly incompassionate to all beings who do not belong to the Tomb of Nazarick and thinks little more of them than tools and toys to amuse himself with. However, to all of his comrades, Demiurge demonstrate true care and loyalty. Demiurge suffers an existential crisis, more than other denizens of Nazarick, due to his fear of losing Ainz Ooal Gown as the last remaining Supreme Being.
Demiurge is amongst the weakest of the Floor Guardian in pure destructive power. However, he has an extremely high intellect and excel at long term strategic planning. Often, he can predict the actions of people with high standing on a national level and equally high hubris down to the exact detail. Though his own personal power is low, Demiurge commands the Demon Lords, a group of high level subordinate whom themselves command legions of inferno demons.
Though he`ll get along with anyone who`s a comrade in Nazarick, Demiurge have an unexplained dislike of Sebas Tian. Unbeknownst to both NPCs, they`ve inherited the conflict from the personal dispute of their own creators.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Momonga is the guildmaster and only remaining active player of the guild Ainz Ooal Gown from the DMMORPG game Yggdrasil, once one of the top guilds in the game. When the guild`s base, the Underground Tomb of Nazarick, was transported to an alternate reality and a new world, Momonga soon assumed for himself the name of Ainz Ooal Gown and began a campaign to make his guild legendary, subsequently turning to world domination.
When he was still human and an Yggdrasil player, Ainz was an adult man already jaded by life, making him prone to analyse things from his perspective as a company worker. In the new world, his game avatar, an undead lich, became his real body, along with all the physical characteristics such a body would have; as a result, he is nigh immune to strong emotions and worldly temptations and desires, because his status as an undead physically shuts them down.
Ainz is calculating, subversive, and cowardly when approaching or in the imminence of a battle, placing his continued survival, as well as that of the guild and its NPCs, who gained life with the transfer, above all else, and planning many moves ahead; once his plans are set in motion, he is ruthlessly efficient in their execution, and will not bat an eyelid at slaying his opponents when pressed. His actions are vicious and ruthless towards any and all that oppose him, and he is motivated by his own gains and survival and the glory of his guild`s name. His greatest weakness is his great fear of not being recognized as a proper leader by the guild`s NPCs, causing him to play along with their plans when he does not understand them simply to not be forced to admit to them that he is not following what they have in mind.</description>

In Momonga`s original design, he`s the combination of everything that he thought was cool, with exaggerated gestures and body language but now that he is actually alive, he embarrasses Momonga. Despite his appearance and personality, he is on the same level as the Floor Guardians and is considered as intelligent as http://anidb.net/ch72778 [Albedo] and http://anidb.net/ch72782 [Demiurge]. He is granted permission to secretly call Ainz his father—secretly he does not want rumors of favoritism to spread.

<description>The Great Tomb of Nazarick is the guild headquarters of http://anidb.net/ch72785 [Ainz Ooal Gown], widely renowned for being an unconquerable dungeon throughout DMMO-RPG named Yggdrasil.
Prior to Ainz Ooal Gown conquering this dungeon, the Great Tomb of Nazarick was originally set to have only six floors. After he conquered it, the dungeon was completely reconstructed and was stretched to over ten floors. For travel between floors, there are specific points on each floor, where gates open to allow magical transit. Each floor has its own guardians as well as numerous monsters under their command.
At the start of the series, the Great Tomb of Nazarick was transported to another world along with Ainz and its custom NPCs, who also came to life as a result of this. After finding himself in an unknown world, Ainz began to strengthen the tomb and collect information to protect it from any threats.

To make matters worse, the Baharuth Empire annually declares war on the Kingdom and criminal organizations are undermining the nation from within.

<description>The Baharuth Empire, commonly referred to as The Empire, is a human nation located to the east of http://anidb.net/ch95428 [Nazarick]. It was once a feudal state, like the http://anidb.net/ch95431 [Re-Estize Kingdom], until the current Emperor established an absolute monarchy by purging many of the nobles. Under his rule, the Empire continues to gain more and more prosperity. The Empire also annually wares war with the Re-Estize Kingdom. However, these invasions are merely meant to slowly weaken the Kingdom while the Empire waits for the opportunity to conquer it with minimal losses.
The Empire became the first nation to make official contact with Nazarick. Fearing the power of its inhabitants, the Emperor chose to accept it as an independent nation while attempting to rally other human nations against it. However, this never came to be, as everyone became terrified of Nazarick`s military might. Afterwards, the Emperor submitted to Nazarick, causing the Empire to become its first vassal state.

It was founded over 600 years ago by the Six Great Gods, who were heavily implied to have been players from Yggdrasil, after they led the humans in a rebellion against the dragons who had enslaved them. It is the strongest human nation around and promotes a doctrine of human supremacy and the persecution of other "lesser" races. With its goal of allowing humanity to survive in the face of the more powerful demi-human nations, the Theocracy often manipulates the affairs of other human nations for what they see as the greater good.

http://anidb.net/ch72785 [Ainz] saved the village when it was attacked by soldiers of the http://anidb.net/ch95438 [Slane Theocracy] and the inhabitants have remained loyal to him ever since. They are so loyal, in fact, that they sided with Ainz when Nazarick and the Kingdom went to war.
The village later becomes part of the Sorcerer Kingdom after Nazarick was victorious in the war. The village has also started to take in demi-human inhabitants, starting with goblins summoned using an item given to the villagers by Ainz, then ogres from the Great Forest of Tob and most recently dwarfs who formed business relations with the Sorcerer Kingdom.
