<description>A black cloud hangs over Ken and Ryuu`s reunion. Brought together by the mysterious death of their master, the two warriors must overcome a challenge unlike any they`ve faced before.
Increasingly disturbed by the dark energies building within him, Ryuu is unexpectedly confronted with the appearance of Shun - a boy claiming to be the long-lost brother he never knew. Soon, signs of their common lineage are revealed as Shun enters a martial arts competition and manifests the same fearsome Dark Hadou. But before Ryuu has the chance to consider whether Shun`s timely appearance might be more than coincidental, agents of the insidious Shadowlaw organization kidnap the boy.
To recover the child, Ryuu must undertake the ultimate journey of self-discovery and learn to control the power threatening to consume him. But with this confidence waning, will he have what it takes to confront Akuma - the vicious lord of the Dark Hadou himself?
Find out as allies old and new join forces against a sinister new threat in the pulse-pounding sequel to the phenomenally popular Street Fighter II series.</description>

<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<description>Ryu is a pretty simple guy. He wears the same outfit wherever he goes - white gi, black belt, red headband, period - and he has the same aim wherever he goes as well. He wants to fight whoever he thinks can make him a stronger fighter.</description>

<description>Kasugano Sakura first appeared in Street Fighter Alpha 2, where she had begun to participate in street fighting after watching Ryu win the first World Warrior tournament. She was searching for him and wished for him to train her to be a better fighter. She met up with many interesting people along the way, and eventually came across Ryu, who was still stressed over the Satsui no Hadou that had corrupted him. Ryu told her he could not train her as he still had much to learn himself. He sparred with her for a bit and as he began to leave, she took a picture of him to remember him by.
In Street Fighter Alpha 3 Sakura decided to travel the world to find Ryu. She started off in her native Japan and fought the sumo wrestler E. Honda, who mentioned that Ryu went to India and Thailand. She also fought a rematch with her rival Karin Kanzuki, and though Karin won the fight, she admitted that Sakura was better and she had learned that winning was not everything. Thereafter traveling with her self-proclaimed sensei, Dan, she met his friend Blanka along the way and was promised a match with him. She continued to search the world for Ryu, eventually ditching Dan and finding Ryu`s friend and rival Ken. She tells him how she loves to fight to better herself, and finding inspiration in those words himself, Ken joins her. Sakura eventually finds Ryu in Thailand, where he is actually being brainwashed by M. Bison. Sagat is also present and he fights Ryu while both Ken and Sakura take on Bison. Sakura is injured by Bison and this combined with Sagat`s attempts to reach Ryu finally release him of his mind control. Ryu then attacks Bison who is now forced to retreat. Ryu tells Sakura that he is not ready to train her and fight a rematch with her yet, and walks off, with Sakura watching as he leaves.
Sakura is playable in Street Fighter EX3, where she is one of the characters to have two level-3 super combos. Also, upon fulfilling certain conditions, Sakura becomes the game`s announcer.
In Street Fighter IV, years have passed since Sakura last saw Ryu, so she decides to find Ryu again for a match. She ends up joining the new World Tournament sponsored by S.I.N., an organization collecting street fighter data from around the world. In her ending after completing arcade mode, Sakura sees Ryu trying to stop the explosion of the machine holding all of the fighter`s data and attempts to help him. Instead, she gets in the way, and Ryu must stop the machine with a Shoryuken since he is worried about Sakura causing the machine to explode and release energy all around. Sakura is engulfed by a red energy and faints, and Ryu carries her to safety.
Sakura has a brother named Tsukushi and she has a friend named Chitose Kei who attends the same high school and sometimes joins Sakura on her street fight tour as a cheerleader.
Rival Schools saw Sakura involved in the adventure between her school and various others in Aohura City. After helping her childhood friend Hinata and the others out from within the ordeal, she realizes how much it means to her to protect something she cares about.</description>
