<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="414179">This is NOT the greatest anime ever made. Not one bit close. Really. Legend of Blah-Blah-Blah focuses about human relations, politics, military and their impacts on flow of history. While some episodes are done with rare talent, extraordinary depth and colour, the next one of endless 110 is so much retarded, u cant help asking yourself - is this sh*t for real? When they decided to make 110 episodes of Democracy, they should have made 110 GOOD episodes. It`s like one episode characters speak of noble value of single person`s rights, and the other one 10 pentazillions of soldiers die, and no one gives a flying f*ck. Not to mention cheesy tactics genius Yan, small packs of useless unimportant  spartans,  dumbest admirals of known universe and lame repetative space fights.

It`s 8 of 10. with all respect to the old age.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="296475">Different from your everyday, run-of-the-mill anime, this is truly an epic story. It`s depth and incredibly large scope are astonishing, on par or even greater than Juuni Kokuki.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="268960">Great plot, exceptional character design. I liked the commentary about war and politics, and how different point of views were colliding and merging together as the serie progressed. The historical facts that were given were also a nice addition in understanding how the rivaling states were created. Despite the high episode count, I still wished at the end that there were still more episodes to watch! Definetly a must see!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="13836">A really nice series, even if the animation is pretty old-fashioned ;)&lt;br /&gt;The story is nice, as it shows intrigues, politics but also nice space-battles.&lt;br /&gt;Funny thing: The German names of the Empire-People! Being German myself I can tell :D Also the "Original German Titel" "HeR(!)densagen vom Kosmsosinsel" is just soo funny as there`s no correct translation to THIS sentence ;D&lt;br /&gt;Very funny ;D I enjoy this series eitherway :D</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="78864">I rarely use word epic, but this deserves it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="196669">Epic space opera. As others have said, real characters and strategic space battles.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="451638">Epic as epic can be - character development and plot continuity added to brilliant political and military tactics.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="23356">Space opera at it`s finest, must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="48145">The only downside to this anime is that it sets a standard that`s practically impossible to match. It`ll remain as the zenith of epic, multiple season-spanning series that involves intricate storyline for many years to come. Considering it already is 10 to 20 years old, its accomplishment is marvelous as it dwarfs brand new productions with its mature, serious and novelistic style. A must see for anyone who wants to watch a deep plot unfolding which is about politics, history and warfare.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="170257">The only bad thing about this anime is that it`s so good, it makes other anime series look bad. The best and most intelligent plot in any anime, and believable characters. Don`t let the relatively old age drive you off. While the visuals are old, they`re far better than most newer series.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="120055">A truly brilliant show and a must see if you`re interested in politically themed anime. The old-school animation and sheer number of episodes may seem off-putting to some, but if you want a rich, well developed story full of realistic characters and situations to sink your teeth into then you couldn`t do much better than this. My only possible complaints would be that there were so many characters (many of whom look quite similar) that I found it hard to keep track of all of them, and the current translations leave a little to be desired... but don`t let that put you off watching this classic masterpiece!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="382602">The [b]greatest anime ever created[/b], a [b]true classic[/b], a [b]masterpiece beyond words[/b].
[i]Epic plot, awesome cast and the most important of all, it`s damn realistic. The characters act the way humans would.[/i]
Also to everyone crying about bad animation, the BDrips have been released and are pretty decent visually.
[b]MUST WATCH IF YOU`RE LOOKING FOR A SERIOUS STORY.[/b]</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="420391">Perfect epic.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="376057">The greatest anime ever created Just pick it up and watch and you will say the same thing as I.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="156165">Objectively best anime existing. Good characters, good plot, nothing extra and very cohesive. 

For mature audience, with deep political and historical themes.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="354131">The one anime closest to perfection. The detail and scope that is present in Legend of the Galactic Heroes is enough to make you shake your head in disbelief. 

A huge cast with no overtly edged personality types, perfect dialogue, classic music and tons of scheming, power play makes certain that the pace will never drop for the entirety of its 110 episodes duration.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="524135">one of the best retro anime ever produced epic storyline for a seinen anime shounen lovers look otherwise</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="106470">This is greatest anime ever made. There are 162 episodes (main series and OVAs) and 3 movies with over 6000 named characters. And 2017 there is going to be a remake. I can`t wait.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="563093">I wanted to do a proper recommendation but find myself at a loss for words after watching the last episode. To put it simply: Legend of the Galactic Heroes is, without doubt, one of the finest achievements in anime history.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="567315">This one is one of THE must see shows. Not even just for anime viewers, for sci-fi lovers in general. I have never come across a space opera that mastered storytelling like this one, and once you have watched it, you will understand.

In recent years, some shows have taken up its torch of expansive worldbuilding storytelling, such as Game of Thrones, but this one preceeds them all, and arguably does it the best.

There are hundreds of characters, but even if you do not remember their names, you will remember them. If you are like me, you often only invest in shorter shows that you know can keep their steam and tell a cohesive story well. This show is over 100 episodes and still manages to do the same. Do NOT miss this one.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="697647">Coming from a long line of trekkies, I never thought I`d have another sci-fi series so easily surpass my expectations like this. LoGH is by far the best sci-fi series I have watched, read, or otherwise experienced. It is a lot more focused on the political side of science fiction than most in the genre, but I can only commend Dr. Tanaka and the others who worked on this for pulling it off so masterfully.

For the love of everything that is good in this world, [b]Watch this show[/b], you`re only doing yourself a disservice otherwise.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="251631">best space opera ever</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="221630">A true classic beyond words and probably one of the most dialog driven anime ever.But it`s successful in technical aspects too.Unforgettable characters,very deep social and political commentaries,great space battles and intense drama makes this old(yet wise) pal a must see before dying.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="17776">Words just can`t describe how epic and all-encompassing this anime is. Impeccably retains an air of gravitas to the very end and beyond. A compelling galactic history, with agonising missed opportunities, plans within plans and actions that play themselves out in epic fashion without ever needing to resort to cheap sensationalism and cowardly cop-outs.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="256644">Best Space opera series ever. The character development its just amazing and plot is out of this world. Focuses a lot on realistic military strategy during the epic fleet battles as well. A true masterpiece.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="160946">Quite simply; Greatness.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="172634">Probably the best space opera out there.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on http://anidb.net/cr991 [Tanaka Yoshiki]`s series of science fiction novels by the same name.
It is late into the 36th century in the ancient Christian calendar; mankind, having developed the technology to travel faster than light speed and colonize many planets, has taken a hold of space, to the point of abandoning Earth almost entirely. Two superpowers comprising almost all the human population have now for one and a half centuries waged to a long stalemate a war for interstellar supremacy: the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Galactic Empire] and the http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets Alliance].
When he was young and poor, http://anidb.net/ch186 [Count Reinhard von Lohengramm], a military genius born a noble in name only, saw his sister, http://anidb.net/ch205 [Countess Annerose von Grunewald], turned into an Imperial concubine; having once helplessly watched her being practically sold to http://anidb.net/ch206 [Kaiser Friedrich IV] as merchandise, he now seeks to crush the Emperor and free her. Meanwhile, http://anidb.net/ch737 [Yang Wenli], an Alliance commander of similar calibre who really wanted to be a historian and not a soldier, wishes only for some peace and quiet; yet, as he unwillingly grows in relevance, he`ll see himself duty-bound to protect the Alliance`s democracy from the threat of the autocratic Empire. The collision of those two masters of tactics and strategy may bring the war to a close, provided, of course, that they aren`t first backstabbed by their respective countries` rotten internal politics...

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<tag id="2606" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2018-11-05">
<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<description>Space Travel usually refers going to space or travelling there with or without a spacecraft.

<description>The anime will fit this category if some or all of the action takes place on another planet which is supposedly in the same universe as Earth, not a complete fantasy world; usually there has to be some concept of space travel.

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<description>The conspiracy thriller (or paranoid thriller) is a sub-genre of the thriller which flourished in the 1970s in the US (and was echoed in other parts of the world) in the wake of a number of high-profile scandals and controversies (most notably Vietnam, the assassination of President Kennedy, Chappaquiddick and Watergate), and which exposed what many people regarded as the clandestine machinations and conspiracies beneath the orderly fabric of political life.
The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top".</description>

<name>alcohol</name>
<description>Alcohol (or more scientifically, ethanol), is one of the world`s oldest psychoactive substances. It is traditionally found in the form of a beverage such as beer, wine, or liquor, although in some contexts it can be inhaled to produce similar or intoxication, and some people prefer another way of consuming beverage-form alcohol.
Alcoholic beverages are many and varied, due to production methods (fermentation or distillation), source materials (grains, fruits, vegetables, other plants), added substances such as flavorings, and many more ways of defining different forms of alcoholic beverages.
Alcoholic beverages are divided into three general classes: beers, wines, and spirits. They are legally consumed in most countries, and over 100 countries have laws regulating their production, sale, and consumption. In particular, such laws specify the minimum age at which a person may legally buy or drink them. This minimum age varies between 16 and 25 years, depending upon the country and the type of drink. Most nations set it at 18 years of age.</description>

<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<description>The difference between space and ocean is marginal. In fact the two are completely interchangeable. Spacecraft are usually called ships and space forces use naval ranks. Movement in space is two-dimensional. There is friction. And not to forget space pirates are roaming through the galaxy and just so often you will encounter space whales.
Some titles take this even a step further by actually displaying the space as a sort of gigantic liquid mass.</description>

A coup d`état is considered successful when the usurpers establish their dominance. If a coup fails, a civil war may ensue.</description>

<name>gore</name>
<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<description>Rebellion, uprising, or insurrection is a refusal of obedience or order. It may, therefore, be seen as encompassing a range of behaviors aimed at destroying or taking over the position of an established authority such as a government, governor, president, political leader, financial institution, or person in charge. On the one hand the forms of behaviour can include non-violent methods such as the (overlapping but not quite identical) phenomena of civil disobedience, civil resistance and nonviolent resistance. On the other hand it may encompass violent campaigns. Those who participate in rebellions, especially if they are armed rebellions, are known as "rebels".&#13;

<name>machiavellian intrigues</name>
<description>Named after Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli (3 May 1469 - 21 June 1527). Machiavelli is considered one of the founders of modern political science, and was a philosopher and diplomat.
He is famous for his political treatise `The Prince`, which is essentially a manual about the acquisition and maintenance of power, including the need for deceit and the application of armed force.
It is the use of deceit from which the term `Machievellian` derives. This term generally applies to a person who uses deceit to manipulate others for their own amoral (and usually power hungry) ends.
This anime contains at least one character whose intrigues drive the plot.</description>

<description>Space opera is a sub-genre of fiction that emphasizes romantic adventures in space. Space opera generally involves large-scale conflicts between opponents with powerful abilities and technology. The genre will often be melodramatic, sometimes playing music that can be nothing short of awesome. Warfare and a battle of wits are usually less emphasized, preferring romance (with exceptions, e.g. Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu). Some space operas tend to be formulaic and sometimes even prosaic, often employing very simple devices and somewhat obvious strategies. An example of this would be the infamous laws of physics in the Macross universe, in which the main male lead will hardly ever get hit in battle.</description>

<description>Wolfgang Mittermeyer was an Imperial Fleet Admiral who served as the Supreme Space Fleet Commander under http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm] and was a skilled tactician, becoming one of the two "Twin Pillars" of Reinhard`s Goldenlöwe Dynasty. For his lightning-fast tactics in combat, Mittermeyer was known by the nickname of "Gale Wolf." He was a close friend of Fleet Admiral http://anidb.net/ch194 [Oskar von Reuenthal], another brilliant commander and the second member of the Twin Pillars, with whom he served as one of the two best commanders in Reinhard`s New Galactic Empire. With the deaths of http://anidb.net/ch187 [Siegfried Kircheis], Reuenthal, and http://anidb.net/ch195 [Paul von Oberstein], Mittermeyer was the last of Reinhard von Lohengramm`s early supporters against the Goldenbaum Dynasty and high nobles left alive.

<description>Oskar von Reuenthal was an Imperial Fleet Admiral who served as the Chief of High Command Office, Governor-General of the former Alliance territory, and was one of the "Twin Pillars" of Kaiser http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard]`s Goldenlöwe Dynasty. Nicknamed the "Bewitching Eyes" for his http://anidb.net/t1065 [heterochromatic eyes], Reuenthal was a brilliant commander and was considered to be second only to Reinhard in terms of strategic ability. He was a close friend of fellow Fleet Admiral http://anidb.net/ch193 [Wolfgang Mittermeyer], the Supreme Fleet Commander and the other one of the Twin Pillars of the Goldenlöwe Dynasty. The two of them were some of Reinhard von Lohengramm`s earliest supporters against the Goldenbaum Dynasty and high nobles ruling the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [first Empire]. However, after complex scheming by various interests behind the scenes, Reuenthal ended up being forced into rising in rebellion against his Kaiser, only to fall in battle.
Fleet Admiral von Reuenthal had been regarded as one of the five best tacticians of that era, and also proved himself to be a capable administrator as the Governor-General of the occupied Alliance territories.

Hildegard, usually referred to by the nickname Hilde, was born in Galactic year 777 into an undistinguished noble family of the the Goldenbaum dynasty, the sole daughter of the benevolent and just Count http://anidb.net/ch203 [Franz von Mariendorf]. From an early age, she was distinguished from the other girls of the aristocrat society by her independent ideas. Completely unconcerned, Hilde pursued her own interests in reading, politics and history. Her mother having died when Hilde was young, her open-minded father respected Hilde`s unique ideas and choices in life.</description>

He was involved in the imprisonment of then-Rear Admiral http://anidb.net/ch193 [Wolfgang Mittermeyer] in 795 UC, paying an interrogator to torture him and after this was unsuccessful attempting to beat him personally. His pride stung by Mittermeyer accusing him of cowardice in beating a manacled man, he released the admiral`s handcuffs to fight him fairly but was easily defeated by Mittermeyer and called for his companions to shoot his opponent. This was foiled by the personal intervention of Admiral http://anidb.net/ch1687 [Reinhard von Müsel] at the request of Rear Admiral http://anidb.net/ch194 [Oskar von Reuenthal].
Flegel cooperated with many high officers and nobles against http://anidb.net/ch186 [von Lohengramm]. In particular, he incited http://anidb.net/ch499 [Susanna von Benemünde] into plots to kill Reinhard or http://anidb.net/ch205 [his sister], all while being careful no definitive evidence could be traced back to himself. He was aboard http://anidb.net/ch1762 [Iserlohn Fortress], holding the rank of Vice Admiral under Fleet Admiral http://anidb.net/ch200 [Gregor von Mückenberger] who valued his political connections. Flegel accompanied von Mückenberger aboard http://anidb.net/ch82216 [his flagship] at the Fourth Battle of Tiamat.
Following the battle, Flegel returned to Odin in 796 UC and conspired with Braunschweig to ensure that Reinhard would die in his next campaign. It was his proposal to leak Imperial plans to http://anidb.net/ch6233 [Phezzan], correctly guessing that the information would be sold to the http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets Alliance].
Having been present at the formation of the http://anidb.net/ch6230 [Lippstadt League], Flegel served his uncle as a Vice Admiral during the Imperial Civil War and died in a mutiny after insisting his ship make a suicide charge. His last words were "Long live the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Empire]."

<description>Otto von Braunschweig was an Imperial Duke and the husband of Kaiser http://anidb.net/ch206 [Friedrich IV]`s daughter Princess Amarie, being among the most influential high nobles at court during the waning years of the Goldenbaum Dynasty. A major opponent of the upstart http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm], he stood for preserving the old order during the Imperial Civil War. Although he possessed much wealth and military might, Duke Braunschweig proved to be incompetent and came to be viewed as the personification of the decadence and decline of the Imperial nobility.
He was forced to commit suicide by his chief retainer shortly after the confederated aristocrat forces were defeated by Lohengramm.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Helmut Lennenkampf was an Imperial High Admiral and the Imperial Consul to the subjected http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets Alliance].
In December 792 UC, Lennenkampf was stationed at http://anidb.net/ch1762 [Iserlohn Fortress] and held the rank of captain. He spoke to http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm], who was a commander at the time, about a mission that involved capturing Count Herxheimer, an Imperial noble attempting to defect to the Alliance.
Lennenkampf, as an admiral, in 798 UC, was present for the testing of the warp capability of http://anidb.net/ch1760 [Geiersberg Fortress] and later took part in Operation Ragnarok. He fought at the Ninth Battle of Iserlohn under the command of http://anidb.net/ch194 [Oskar von Reuenthal]. Alliance admiral http://anidb.net/ch741 [Dusty Attenborough] managed to trick Lennenkampf, however, and dealt his fleet significant casualties. In the end, the Alliance evacuated Iserlohn Fortress and left it to the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Empire].
His fleet briefly took part in a skirmish with the Yang Fleet during the Battle of the Black Hole, in March 799 UC. Lennekampf`s caution during the battle resulted in a successful attack by Admiral Yang`s forces, buying it enough time to escape.
With the surrender of the Alliance to the Empire in the aftermath of Operation Ragnarok and the signing of the Treaty of Ba`alat, Lennenkampf was assigned to be the Imperial Consul on Heinessen, the representative of Kaiser Reinhard. He had the retired http://anidb.net/ch737 [Yang Wenli] watched, suspecting him of wanting to rise up in revolt against the Empire. After the Alliance government attempted to execute Yang and his subordinates rescued him, they broke into the Consul`s headquarters, a hotel, and took him prisoner. Yang and his supporters intended to use him as a hostage to get themselves passage off of Heinessen.
Lennekampf, ashamed for having been taken prisoner, committed suicide in his cell. Yang and his renegades claimed that he was still alive and took his body with them. They later returned it to the Empire by leaving it in a space capsule, along with a note explaining the circumstances of his death.

However, Littenheim had no real martial talents and was defeated by Admiral http://anidb.net/ch187 [Siegfried Kircheis], whose fleet was half the size of the Marquis`s.
Marquis Littenheim was killed by http://anidb.net/ch82213 [one of his former subordinates] while at http://anidb.net/ch82218 [Garmisch Fortress] shortly after his defeat in battle.

<description>Susanna von Beenemünde was http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Imperial] Consort to Kaiser http://anidb.net/ch206 [Friedrich IV] for several years, before he dismissed her in favour of http://anidb.net/ch205 [Annerose von Grünewald]. Unable to accept losing the emperor`s favour, Beenemünde hatched several plots to win back Friedrich`s favour. Mostly, these involved assassination attempts on Annerose`s younger brother, http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm]. These ill-conceived attempts all failed, yet there was never sufficient proof to indict the Baroness.
As her last, desperate act, Lady Beenemünde decided to murder Annerose von Grünewald herself. Beenemünde`s grief at having been stricken from Friedrich`s sight was so great that she believed he would return to her, if only Annerose were dead. The plan failed, and at the order of the Kaiser, Beenemünde was forced to drink poison, thus committing suicide. It was announced to the public that she died of natural causes, and Kaiser Friedrich IV personally attended her funeral.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Yang Wenli is one of two protagonists within the series. Like http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard], both of them share similar roles within their respective nations as famous national heroes renowned for their military skill. Compared to Reinhard, Yang is much more humble and dislikes his popularity as being a burden. Yang originally wanted to become a historian and only attended the Free Planets Defense Force Command Academy so he can get free education, while Reinhard relishes his fame and was ambitious to overthrow the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [empire].
At the start of the series, Yang has gained some fame as the "Hero of El Facil" for his exploits in the evacuation of the planet before Imperial occupation, and gains much more fame to become a national hero by the end of the first season. During the second season, he generally takes a lesser role compared to Reinhard, but returns in full force in third season before he is assassinated by members of the Terraist Church.
Yang was a mild-tempered person who lives on red tea, a genius tactician and strategist that exceeds even Reinhard. His weakness lies in his unwillingness to risk democracy by assuming more direct powers and responsibilities. Not willing to take on a bigger role or responsibility, he and Reinhard`s battle were never in equal footing and at same time handcuffing him from doing things that could change the scale of the power balance. He also openly respects Reinhard and considers him to be a true genius as Reinhard`s ability does not seem to confine in just military affairs and is able to act on what his mind tells him while Yang might be reluctant to do so if given same situation. He also agrees that benevolent autocracy is better and more efficient than corrupted democracy if social change is needed, and noted that if he was born in the empire, he would actually volunteer to serve under Reinhard despite his dislike of military. On the other hand, he was glad to be born in Free Planets as it gives him the freedom, and believes that while democracy is less efficient and can be slowed dramatically with corruption it nevertheless is better because it is less likely to be corrupted completely and no one has absolute power, because after all, a good and wise Emperor such as Reinhard doesn`t come along often.
The http://anidb.net/ch82015 [Hyperion] is the flagship of Yang Wenli`s fleet. It is retrofitted from a frontier security squadron flagship. It is lightly armed, possessing only 32 forward cannons which comprise its main armament. It possesses a large and spread out multi-level bridge with a large conference table commonly used for meetings by Admiral Yang and his staff, as well as a large tactical viewscreen used during battle to display fleet movements.

A flying ace with over 250 kills (which he estimated would put him in the all-time top 10), he moved up the ranks from flying officer when in http://anidb.net/ch740 [Vice Admiral Paeta]`s 2nd fleet through squadron leader, commanding one half of the Iserlohn stationed fleet`s Spartanians, to wing commander under http://anidb.net/ch737 [Yang Wen-li].
Brash, hard-drinking, womanising and wise-cracking, he was the perfect foil to his good friend, the calm, nap-taking, crossword-puzzle-solving http://anidb.net/ch781 [Ivan Konev]. Together, the two of them were in charge of training fresh recruits to their squadrons. In this role, he mentored both http://anidb.net/ch1298 [Karin] and http://anidb.net/ch742 [Julian].
In keeping with his womanising and drinking, he flew with an ace of hearts insignia on his helmet and his Spartanian (No. 170), and his squadrons were named after a variety of liquors. He belied his brashness, though, by advocating teamwork and many-on-one tactics with his pilots, rather than urging them to individual glory.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Job Trunicht was an http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Alliance] politician and its penultimate head of state, leading what was widely perceived as an incompetent and corrupt administration, a symbol of the decline of http://anidb.net/ch1026 [Arle Heinessen]`s legacy. Though democratically elected, Job Trunicht used fear to maintain his power—fear of the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Galactic Empire], and fear of his own secret police, the murderous http://anidb.net/ch82359 [Patriotic Knights Corps]. He was simply out for his own personal power and survival, becoming involved in factional politics and not caring for the future of the Alliance, despite outwardly preaching the opposite.
Trunicht`s corruption was seen as one of the contributing factors to the fall of the Alliance and democracy to http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm]. After the defeat of the Alliance in Operation Ragnarök he took responsibility for the defeat and resigned, having surrendered the Alliance because his life was threatened by the Imperial Fleet. Following the complete subjugation of the Alliance during the Second Alliance–Imperial War, Trunicht made dealings with both the Church of Terra and the New Galactic Empire, ultimately betraying all of the factions that he once claimed loyalty to.
Trunicht was later shot by http://anidb.net/ch194 [Oskar von Reuenthal] shortly before the latter`s own death, after having insulted Kaiser Reinhard in their conversation.

<description>Murai was a http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets Alliance] officer who served in the 13th Fleet under the command of admiral http://anidb.net/ch737 [Yang Wenli]. He was with the fleet from the very beginning, participating in the capture of http://anidb.net/ch1762 [Iserlohn Fortress] in the Fifth Battle of Tiamat: prior to the battle, Murai expressed concern over the amount of trust Yang Wenli had placed in the http://anidb.net/ch6224 [Rosen Ritter]`s regimental commander, http://anidb.net/ch748 [Walter von Schönkopf].
Murai first met Yang Wenli while a commander assigned to investigate the mutiny at Econia. Murai`s impartiality and attention to details led him to conclude that Lt. Commander Yang was the more credible side in the incident.
After the death of Yang, Murai left Iserlohn and returned to Heinessen as a private citizen. By doing so he swayed lukewarm supporters of the nascent Republic the opportunity to leave, stripping the numbers down to a hard core. He also felt it was time for his generation to step aside and allow younger leaders to carry on.
Unexpectedly, Murai was selected by http://anidb.net/ch194 [Oskar von Reuenthal] as an civilian emissary to http://anidb.net/ch742 [Julian Mintz] to ask that that the Iserlohn Corridor be closed to Imperial traffic during von Reuenthal`s rebellion.

Ansbach sided with the nobles during the Imperial Civil War and served in the http://anidb.net/ch6230 [Lippstadt League]. He defended his lord when http://anidb.net/ch201 [Ovlesser] advanced upon Braunschweig and killed Ovlesser with his pistol. When http://anidb.net/ch254 [Braunschweig`s nephew] was killed in a rebellion on Westerland, Ansbach disagreed strongly with Braunschweig`s decision to use nuclear weapons upon the planet and instead advocated for punishing only the ringleaders of the rebellion. He was overruled and imprisoned for voicing an apparent defeatist opinion.
He escaped from his imprisonment when Braunschweig had lost most of his support and was in imminent danger of capture. He disabused his lord of the possibility of alliance with http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm] or escape, and coerced his lord to commit suicide. Ansbach offered Reinhard von Lohengramm the body of Duke Braunschweig in an attempt to assassinate Lohengramm. His attempt failed but he succeeded in killing http://anidb.net/ch187 [Siegfried Kircheis]. He committed suicide with a poison capsule that he had secreted in a tooth. Despite being disillusioned, Ansbach had remained loyal to Braunschweig and his final words were of apology to his lord.

Eventually, the Yang`s forces rejoined Attenborough`s squadron, critically outgunning and outnumbering Stocks` forces. Despite Yang`s repeated offers of surrender, Stocks refused to surrender, and was lost with the rest of the 11th Fleet.

<description>In the http://anidb.net/a584 [Legend of Galactic Heroes] universe, the Galactic Empire, also known as the Empire, is a nation with a feudalistic system and an aristocratic government based on the planet Odin, forged by http://anidb.net/ch1019 [Rudolf von Goldenbaum] and ruled with an iron fist by the Goldenbaum Dynasty and its nobles for centuries. The Empire was originally forged as its precursor, the Galactic Federation, decayed and its people looked for a hero-like politician to guide them; Rudolf, who was a very charismatic leader, fit the bill perfectly, and was also very power-hungry; he jumped at the opportunity, took all power into his hands, dissolved the Federation into a new Empire, and named himself the Kaiser. Eventually, refugees under the leadership of http://anidb.net/ch1026 [Ale Heinessen] would flee the oppression and form what became known as the http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets Alliance], but the Alliance was discovered and attacked as rebels, and subsequently waged a seemingly endless war to a stalemate. As one might expect, nobles can be either born with that status or granted it, and that one of the lead characters would be made into a noble is a key plot point in the story.
After almost 160 years of war and many centuries of bad government, http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm] would take advantage of his military prowess to garner allies and power, even more so during the civil war that followed the death of http://anidb.net/ch206 [Kaiser Friedrich IV]. Soon afterwards, Reinhard would use that power in his favor to depose the Goldenbaum dynasty entirely, seizing power to himself and thus founding the Lohengramm Dynasty, also referred to as the New Galactic Empire. Under Reinhard`s leadership, the Empire would undergo drastic reforms; he revoked the privileges of nobles, seized control of the then-autonomous planet http://anidb.net/ch6233 [Phezzan], moved the government to it, started a new calendar, and did many other things that caused the horror of the former aristocracy, causing many nobles to unsuccessfully try to stop him. He soon also conquered the Alliance and imposed a harsh peace treaty, and after a revolt also annexed it altogether. After his death, his wife http://anidb.net/ch199 [Hildegard von Mariendorf] would lead the Galactic Empire into maturity, eventually changing it into a constitutional monarchy, as his highly respected, long-time rival, Alliance admiral http://anidb.net/ch737 [Yang Wen-li] would have argued for.</description>

<description>In the http://anidb.net/a584 [Legend of Galactic Heroes] universe, the Free Planets Alliance, also known as the Alliance or the FPA, is a nation with a democratic government based on the planet Heinessen. During its history, it eventually grew to occupy the Sagittarius Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, and became one of the two centres of human civilization in the galaxy. It was founded by refugees who fled the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Galactic Empire] under the leadership of http://anidb.net/ch1026 [Ale Heinessen], but was discovered and attacked, and subsequently waged a seemingly endless war to a stalemate.
For several reasons, after almost 160 years of war, the military situation in the Alliance rapidly deteriorated in comparison to the Empire and the war stalemate soon became a massive one-sided victory. The peace treaty imposed by http://anidb.net/ch186 [the Emperor] was very harsh, and the Imperial interference soon led to uprising, which was then used by the Emperor to again declare war. This new war would end in only a few months and lead to the complete dissolution of the Alliance.</description>

<description>Reinhard was born into a poor noble family. He lived with his father and his older sister Annerose. His mother died when he was young so he knew very little about her. When Reinhard moved to a middle class suburban neighborhood, he met Siegfried Kircheis and they soon became inseparable friends. When his father sold Annerose to become Kaiser Friedrich IV`s concubine, Reinhard swore that he would overthrow the Goldenbaum dynasty to rescue his older sister. He left school to join the military academy and persuaded Kircheis to come along with him.</description>

<description>An artificial sphere 45km in diameter and weighing 40 trillion tonnes, Geiersberg (Vulture`s Castle) was an Imperial fortress in the same class as http://anidb.net/ch1762 [Iserlohn], though smaller in magnitude. Its primary armament, the Geiers Haken (ガイエスハーケン, Vulture`s Claw) was an X-ray beam cannon with a wavelength of 100 angstroms and a total power output of 740,000,000 MW, comparable to Iserlohn`s Thor Hammer. Its hangars could berth a fleet of 16,000 ships. The surface was composed of alloys, ceramic and hydro-metal.
Due to the gradual sublimation of some of the fluid metal over the course of the years since its construction, the surface had acquired a skeletal appearance, with various "pools" or "lakes" of fluid metal. One of these was thought to resemble a vulture, leading to the fortress acquiring its fanciful name.
It was used by the high nobles as their headquarters during the Lippstadt Rebellion. It was later augmented with 12 warp engines, as per http://anidb.net/ch218 [Admiral Schaft]`s plan, allowing it to warp into the Iserlohn Corridor and mount an assault on Iserlohn. For this operation, it was placed under the command of http://anidb.net/ch190 [Admiral Kempf].</description>

<description>Iserlohn Fortress was an Imperial fortress located near the Tiamat Starzone. Existing within the eponymously named Iserlohn Corridor, one of only two navigable star routes between the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Empire] and the http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets Alliance] (the other being the http://anidb.net/ch6233 [Phezzan] Corridor), Iserlohn kept the territories of the Galactic Empire safe from Alliance invasion.
The fortress had a diameter of 60 kilometres and a mass of nearly 60 trillion tonnes. Its primary weapon was an enormous X-ray beam cannon, the Thor Hammer, which was capable of destroying large numbers of enemy vessels in a single shot. Its docks could berth 20,000 ships, and its dedicated agriculture blocks could sustain both a garrison of up to 2 million and a civilian population of up to 3 million indefinitely. The fortress exterior was a several-layer-thick coating of liquid hydro-metal, which absorbed solid projectiles and reflected directed energy; hundreds of cannon turrets floated in this liquid and would rise to fire at approaching enemies.

<description>The Galactic Empire Legitimate Government was a government-in-exile formed on Heinessen in August 798 UC, after the Imperial Civil War, with the goal of opposing http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm]`s rule in the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Galactic Empire] and restoring the power of the Goldenbaum Dynasty. It was led by Prime Minister http://anidb.net/ch768 [Jochen von Remscheid], the former Imperial high commissioner on http://anidb.net/ch6233 [Phezzan], and also had the young Emperor http://anidb.net/ch225 [Erwin Josef II] as the source of their self-proclaimed legitimacy. Their regime consisted of many former http://anidb.net/ch6230 [Lippstadt League] supporters and other aristocrats. The government`s existence became the casus belli for Reinhard von Lohengramm to declare war on the Alliance and defeat it during Operation Ragnarök, at which point the exiled court was dissolved.

The Triglav served as a squadron flagship, joining the http://anidb.net/ch96406 [Yang Fleet] at its formation in late 796 UC. Its first battle was against the 11th Fleet in the Battle of Doria, where Commodore Attenborough`s squadron drew the squadron of Rear Admiral http://anidb.net/ch809 [Stocks] away from the rest of the http://anidb.net/ch96433 [11th Fleet].
The Triglav was next engaged in a small, inconclusive battle with the fleet of Rear Admiral http://anidb.net/ch816 [Eihendorf], part of the http://anidb.net/ch190 [Kempff] Fleet, in 798 UC, whilst it was on a training cruise. Later that year, it defended http://anidb.net/ch1762 [Iserlohn Fortress] at the Eighth Battle of Iserlohn, and again in the Ninth Battle of Iserlohn, when High Admiral http://anidb.net/ch194 [Oskar von Reuenthal] attacked the fortress as part of Operation Ragnarok from late 798 UC to early 799 UC.
Joining the rest of the Yang Fleet in evacuating the fortress, the Triglav fought in the subsequent battles of the war leading up to the Battle of Vermilion in 799 UC.

<description>The Leda II was an Alliance cruiser which was notable for being the ship that http://anidb.net/ch737 [Yang Wenli] died on.
The Leda II`s first notable mission was as the ship that Admiral Yang Wenli chose to travel with from http://anidb.net/ch1762 [Iserlohn Fortress] to Heinessen in 798 UC, for an extra-legal `inquiry`. When the Imperial fleet and http://anidb.net/ch1760 [Geiersberg Fortress] attacked Iserlohn in Yang`s absence, the Leda II took him back, serving as flagship of the small fleet of 5000 ships sent as reinforcements. In the ensuing battle, the Leda II was struck by enemy fire, but its shields held.
In July 799 UC, the Leda II also ferried Fleet Admiral Yang and his comrades off of Heinessen.
The Leda II eventually became part of the El Facil Revolutionary Reserve Force, which fought the combined fleets of Kaiser http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard] at the Battle of the Corridor in 800 UC. When a truce was called and the Kaiser invited Yang for talks, Yang once again elected to take the Leda II. Representatives from the El Facil Revolutionary Government also attended. A Terraist ploy resulted in the ship being boarded by Terraist-controlled Imperial destroyers en route, and a slaughter ensued as the assassins hunted for Yang. With Yang`s subordinates having been informed of the threat to his life soon after the Leda II`s departure, the flagship http://anidb.net/ch82027 [Ulysses] managed to catch up to the Leda II`s position. http://anidb.net/ch742 [Julian Mintz] and the http://anidb.net/ch6224 [Rosen Ritter] were too late, and Yang was assassinated. The Leda II was then evacuated.

Thrown into emotional turmoil by the assassins taunting and cutting barbs, he seeks comfort in Hilda`s arms and ends up sleeping with her.

By 798 UC, the Maurya had been repainted with a distinctive `tiger-stripe` livery, and it defended http://anidb.net/ch1762 [Iserlohn Fortress] at the Eighth Battle of Iserlohn. Following the Alliance victory, Rear Admirals Guen and http://anidb.net/ch901 [Alarcon] led their respective fleets in pursuit of the withdrawing Imperial forces, intending to eliminate the few remaining ships. However, both fleets were destroyed by Imperial reinforcements — the Maurya itself was sunk by the Reuenthal Fleet.

<description>The Berlin was the Imperial flagship of the http://anidb.net/ch6230 [Lippstadt League]`s fleet under Duke http://anidb.net/ch261 [Otto von Braunschweig].
It stayed at the rear of the Lippstadt fleets when they sortied out of http://anidb.net/ch1760 [Geiersberg Fortress] in an ill-fated attempt to defeat the forces of http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm], during the Imperial Civil War in 797 UC. Drawn into a trap, Braunschweig beat a hasty retreat to the fortress, and the Berlin`s shield ships were lost in the process. The Berlin remained under fire and took damage to its rear port hull, before it was rescued by the fleet of High Admiral Merkatz. (LOGH: `Courage and Loyalty`)
With the Lippstadt League`s fleet much reduced by the fiasco, and defeat inevitable, Duke Braunschweig sortied the remains of his fleet again soon after, in an attempt to kill Marquis Lohengramm and save the situation. The attack failed, and the Berlin retreated to the fortress once more. The Berlin was presumably captured when Lohengramm`s forces seized the fortress immediately after the battle.
It is apparently identical to the http://anidb.net/ch82216 [Wilhelmina] and http://anidb.net/ch1754 [Ostmark] in design. Like the Ostmark, in battle is accompanied by two shield ships which travel in close proximity to the port and starboard side. The Berlin has more than one "set" of these, as it sortied with replacements after its first set of shield ships were destroyed.

<description>The Garmisch Fortress was an Imperial fortress. It was used by http://anidb.net/ch6230 [Lippstadt League] forces as the headquarters of Marquis http://anidb.net/ch303 [Littenheim] and his fleet of 50,000 ships. It was captured by forces under High Admiral http://anidb.net/ch187 [Kircheis] during the Imperial Civil War.
Garmisch Fortress was a collection of 5 spheres in a row of 3 and a row of 2, with cylindrical connections linking each sphere to adjacent spheres. There was no indication of a main gun on the same scale as the Vulture`s Claw and the Thor Hammer of the http://anidb.net/ch1760 [Geiersburg] and http://anidb.net/ch1762 [Iserlohn] fortresses respectively. The main fortress command centre was in one of the spheres in the row of 2. The command center`s internal layout was very similar to that of Iserlohn Fortress.

Lemmler presumably ended up in an Alliance prison camp after Iserlohn was captured.

The fleet was also unique in using the fast battleship in place of the standard battleship, which gave the Black Lancers strong offensive power and mobility. The ships of this fleet were painted entirely black except for the Imperial crest and sensor domes on their hulls.

It was completely routed at Astarte by http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm]`s Imperial Fleet, being outnumbered and separated from its allies.

<description>The 13th Fleet was a unit of the http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets] Star Fleet.

The flagship of the 13th Fleet was the http://anidb.net/ch82015 [Hyperion].
Following the Alliance`s devastating defeat at the Battle of Astarte, the 13th fleet was formed out of the survivors of the http://anidb.net/ch96403 [2nd], http://anidb.net/ch96404 [4th] and http://anidb.net/ch96405 [6th] Fleets, supplemented with new-recruits. Composed of both newly constructed warships and vessels still bearing damage from the Astarte fiasco, the 13th Fleet was only about one-half the typical size of a Free Planets Alliance fleet, numbering only 6,400 vessels and 700,000 personnel at its inception.
Its original command group included Rear Admiral Yang Wenli as Fleet Commander, Commodore http://anidb.net/ch751 [Edwin Fischer] as Deputy Fleet Commander, Captain http://anidb.net/ch752 [Murai] as Chief of Staff and Commander http://anidb.net/ch793 [Fyodor Patorichev] as Deputy Chief of Staff.

<description>The 1st Fleet was a unit of the http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets] Star Fleet. In 798 UC it was stationed at the planet Heinessen as the Alliance capital`s sole defensive fleet.
As no actual separate fleets existed - or were needed - prior to the Battle of Dagon - it is certain that it was the first independent force established by the Alliance as it strengthened and expanded its forces to keep the Imperial forces from taking over its territory. It presumably was started from one of the six squadrons which http://anidb.net/ch1030 [Lin Pao] led to victory in the aforementioned battle. In any event, it was formed before the Second Battle of Tiamat.
Over the 150 years of the war, the 1st Fleet was, aside from its role as a line of defense for planet Heinessen itself, the main internal military arm to prevent piracy and other space-based crimes. Because of this, the 1st Fleet enjoyed more support than most from the Alliance populace.
Although it had, throughout the war, fought in few actual battles, three years of severe attrition had whittled down the Free Planets Star Fleet to only two main, full-strength fleets by 799 UC: the 1st Fleet under Vice Admiral http://anidb.net/ch740 [Paetta], and the Yang Fleet. With the latter fleet charged with protecting the Alliance from the Iserlohn front, it was the 1st Fleet, as well as the newly-formed 14th and 15th, which formed the core of the 39,600 Alliance ships which fought at the Battle of Rantemario.
Following the battle, what battle-ready ships remained were transferred under the command of http://anidb.net/ch737 [Yang Wenli] during his guerilla-like counterattack, and the 1st Fleet, for all intents and purposes, ceased to exist with the Treaty of Ba‘alat.

<description>The 5th Fleet was a unit of the http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets] Star Fleet that existed since at least 745 UC.
It fought at the Second Battle of Tiamat in 745 UC under the command of Vice Admiral http://anidb.net/ch77658 [Wallace Warwick], where it fought against the fleets of admirals Wilhelm von Mückenberger and Keit. The battle resulted in a major Alliance victory.
It was later commanded by http://anidb.net/ch773 [Alexandre Bewcock] at the Third Battle of Tiamat, in 794 UC, surviving the battle intact. It covered the retreat of the surviving units of Willem Holland`s 11th Fleet after they withdrew from their main attack against the Imperial formation.
The 5th Fleet was also led by Vice Admiral Bewcock during the Alliance`s attempted invasion of the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Galactic Empire] in 796 UC. The 5th Fleet initially fought against the Reuenthal Fleet during the Battle of Bilrost, managing to disengage and withdraw but sustaining 30% casualties. It later took part in the Battle of Amritsar, where it, along with the http://anidb.net/ch96406 [13th Fleet], was able to escape from the area (although at the cost of considerable casualties).

The Quetzalcoatl participated in the Alliance invasion of Imperial territory in 796 UC. Low on supplies, the 7th Fleet was attacked by the Kircheis Fleet in the Dverger System and encircled. Vice Admiral Hawood accepted Vice Admiral http://anidb.net/ch187 [Kircheis]` surrender recommendation, and the Quetzalcoatl presumably fell into Imperial hands.

<description>The 8th Fleet was a unit of the http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets] Star Fleet and was formed some time prior to 745 UC. It played a notable role in the Second Battle of Tiamat under the command of Vice Admiral http://anidb.net/ch77659 [Fang Tchewling]. The 8th Fleet, under the command Vice Admiral http://anidb.net/ch775 [Appleton], was part of the great Alliance invasion of the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Galactic Empire] in 796 UC.
One of the Imperial planets it occupied was the planet Kleingelt. When the Imperial forces counterattacked after Alliance supply lines were cut, the 8th Fleet was engaged in the Battle of Wansteidt by the Mecklinger Fleet under Vice Admiral http://anidb.net/ch192 [Ernest Mecklinger]. The 8th Fleet managed to disengage and evade pursuit only after suffering 30% casualties, being one of only three fleets that managed to escape to the Amritsar Starzone relatively intact.
At the Battle of Amritsar, the 8th Fleet formed the center of the Alliance line. It came under heavy attack by the http://anidb.net/ch96402 [Black Lancers] during the battle, resulting in the destruction of the flagship http://anidb.net/ch82270 [Krishna] along with Appleton, who went down with the ship. The remnants of the 8th Fleet escaped the battle due to the efforts of the http://anidb.net/ch96406 [13th Fleet] under http://anidb.net/ch737 [Yang Wenli]. Afterwards, the 8th Fleet was disbanded and its survivors assigned to other Alliance units, notably the Iserlohn Garrison Fleet which became known as the Yang Fleet.

<description>The 10th Fleet was a unit of the http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets] Star Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral http://anidb.net/ch777 [Ulanfu]. Under his command the 10th Fleet fought in a number of major battles in the final years of the Alliance–Imperial War.
The 10th Fleet was one of the three Alliance fleets engaged at the Third Battle of Tiamat, where it was never in heavy combat, but played a vital role nonetheless in covering the defeated 11th Fleet during its retreat after the 11th`s commanding officer, Vice Admiral Willem Holland, was killed in a perfectly executed Imperial counter attack orchestrated by Imperial Admiral http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm].
The 10th Fleet, like most of the Alliance Star Fleets, later suffered heavy losses during the Alliance invasion of the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Galactic Empire]. Before the decisive Battle of Amritsar, the 10th fleet lost half of its combat potential after it was hemmed in and besieged in planetary orbit by Imperial Vice Admiral http://anidb.net/ch191 [Fritz Joseph Bittenfeld]`s http://anidb.net/ch96402 [Black Lancers].
Outnumbered and desperately low on supplies, 10th Fleet`s position soon became too precarious to maintain, forcing Ulanfu to attempt a forced breakout using the tightly packed spindle formation. Ulanfu was killed leading this attack through the Bittenfeld`s siege formation, and only about 50% of 10th Fleet`s ships escaped successfully.

<description>The 11th Fleet was a unit of the http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets] Star Fleet that was formed sometime prior to 745 UC.
During the Second Battle of Tiamat, while under the command of Vice Admiral http://anidb.net/ch77661 [John Drinker Cope], it was instrumental in the destruction of the Imperial Mückenberger Fleet.
It played a major role in the Third Battle of Tiamat, in 795 UC, while under the command of Vice Admiral Willem Holland. Holland was an extremely aggressive commander, and trained his fleet to use amorphous tactics to push into the enemy`s ranks while avoiding concentrations of enemy fire. When battle was joined at Third Tiamat, Holland almost immediately ordered 11th Fleet to break ranks and charge the Imperial lines alone, despite being outnumbered roughly four to one by the combined Imperial forces.
Holland`s reckless aggression and fluid tactics (described as `artistic` by observers on both sides) were temporarily successful; 11th Fleet got in among the Imperials and caused a great deal of damage and confusion to their main body. However, Holland pressed his attack too fiercely, and refused to take time to regroup his command. Eventually, this led to a temporary halt, and an Imperial counterattack destroyed Holland`s flagship and inflicted significant casualties among the rest of the fleet. The 11th Fleet retreated in disarray with heavy losses, under cover of the 5th and 10th Fleets. It was some time before 11th Fleet could be ready for action again. It did not participate in the Alliance invasion of the Empire in 796 UC likely because it was still rebuilding. (TBT: `Part Two`)
However, it did take part in the Alliance Civil War of 797 UC. Its commander and vice commander, Vice Admiral http://anidb.net/ch800 [Luglanju] and Commodore http://anidb.net/ch809 [Stocks], both pledged allegiance to the http://anidb.net/ch6225 [National Salvation Military Council] after its coup d`état. They subsequently fought against http://anidb.net/ch737 [Yang Wenli]`s Iserlohn Garrison Fleet at the Doria Starzone. During the Battle of Doria, the 11th Fleet was completely defeated, taking 90% casualties.

In 796 UC, it took part in the attempted invasion of the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Galactic Empire]. The fleet suffered very heavy losses against Vice Admiral http://anidb.net/ch189 [Cornelius Lutz] during the Battle of Bolthorn, with Borodin committing suicide at the end of the engagement.

<description>The Rentenberg Fortress was a fusion-powered http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Imperial] fortress. During the Imperial Civil War, it was initially occupied by the http://anidb.net/ch6230 [Lippstadt League], but it ultimately fell to forces commanded by Marquis http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm].
Rentenberg was partly built on and into an irregular roughly kidney-shaped asteroid. Although it had a dome-like metallic area on one side, there was no indication of a main gun on the same scale as the Vulture`s Claw and the Thor Hammer of the http://anidb.net/ch1760 [Geiersburg] and http://anidb.net/ch1762 [Iserlohn] fortresses respectively. Internally, the fortress consisted of numerous passageways tunneled into the asteroid interspersed with a few larger chambers.
The fortress had banks of beam turrets in retractable mountings. Due to the irregular shape of the asteroid, there were blind spots in the coverage that were exploited by Admirals http://anidb.net/ch193 [Mittermeyer] and http://anidb.net/ch194 [Reuenthal] to reach service passageways that led to the main fusion reactor powering the whole fortress.

<description>Ottofried III was the 31st kaiser of the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Galactic Empire].
As Crown Prince, Ottofried III was very popular, and it was assumed he would make a very capable Kaiser. Ottofried III was known to have simultaneously occupied all 3 military joint chiefs of staff positions when he was Crown Prince. He also held the position of Prime Minister as Crown Prince. After his coronation, the position of Prime Minister was permanently left vacant and taboo in all subsequent reigns (until being filled by http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm]), and its responsibilities taken up by the Minister of State. This was to prevent any subject from following the same path or filling the same position as a Kaiser. Unfortunately, after Ottofried III assumed the throne, a number of conspiracies against the Empire occurred. Most of these conspiracies failed, but they led Kaiser Ottofried III to become extremely paranoid. So fearful was he of assassination, he married 4 different women as Kaiserin and changed his designated heir 5 times. It is unknown what happened to his wives after they were divorced, or his sons after they were disowned. It is likely they were either exiled, imprisoned or executed. Kaiser Ottofried III died a lingering death, hardly consuming any food, for fear it might have been poisoned.
