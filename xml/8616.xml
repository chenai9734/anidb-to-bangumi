<description>The battle in the Digital World ended in victory for the Digimon and humans who joined forces and fought together. One year after that battle...
Tagiru Akashi, a member of the Xros Heart street basketball team, has set his sights on surpassing his respected senior, Taiki Kudou, and his classmate, Yuu Amano, to become the team`s top star. But then, in the midst of these peaceful days, a mysterious boy and his companions appear before Taiki. In warning, the boy tells Taiki, "Don`t try to get involved in what`s about to happen in this town," and disappears...
Clueless to what`s going on in the town, Tagiru visits an arcade. There he experiences a strange sensation, as though the flow of time around him is thrown off kilter. Then he senses an unknown presence lurking around the area...
Tagiru hears the voice of someone who seems to be injured and follows it through a distorted space in the air, finding himself in a world called "DigiQuartz," where time progresses differently from that of the real world. In DigiQuartz, Tagiru watches as a team of two boys and a girl hunt a monster they call a Digimon. This is the very trio that had appeared before Taiki with the warning to steer clear - Ryouma, Ren, and Airu.
Tagiru then meets Gumdramon, the owner of the voice that had spoken to him in the arcade, and saves him from being hunted by Ryouma and his companions. Tagiru instantly befriends Gumdramon and they decide to join the Digimon Hunt together. Then Tagiru visits a watchmaker`s shop on the outskirts of town, where the mysterious old Watchmaker, rumored among many Digimon Hunters, gives him a Xros Loader.
Returning to DigiQuartz, Tagiru then encounters MetalTyrannomon. He immediately attempts a Digimon Hunt, but he and Gumdramon are soon backed into a tight spot by MetalTyrannomon`s counterattack. Just then the Xros Loader begins to glow, and Gumdramon Digivolves into Arresterdramon! With his greatly heightened power, he defeats MetalTyrannomon, ending Tagiru`s first Digimon Hunt in success.
Thus the Hunter boys Taiki, Tagiru, and Yuu begin a brand new adventure as they go on to Hunt the Digimon that appear in the human world!</description>

<description>In the context of manga and associated media, shounen, literally meaning "youth" and often also specifically "boy", refers to a male audience roughly between the ages of 10 and 18.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>adventure</name>
<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>proxy battles</name>
<description>In our terms, a proxy battle is a battle where humans use creatures/robots to do the fighting for them, either by commanding those creatures/robots or by simply evolving them/changing them into battle mode. Often the training aspect is also involved, or in some cases the proxies are nothing more than holographic representatives of some other variation of competition (like for example a card game). While many popular shounen anime fit under this category, it`s not limited to shounen anime.</description>

<summary>The new chapter in the Digimon Xros Wars series, Time Traveling Hunter Boys, finally begins! The story takes place one year after the battle with the Death Generals. Taiki has started a basketball team, Xros Heart, with his school underclassmen Yuu and Tagiru. Life has been peaceful. Then, one day, the air before Taiki flickers and a monstrous shadow flashes before his eyes. He then meets three mysterious characters - Ryouma, Ren, and Airu - who tell him "This town may become a bit chaotic. Our own game is about to begin." What could these words mean...?!
The next day, Tagiru hears the voice of a Digimon on the verge of death, Gumdramon. This leads him to DigiQuartz, a game world inhabited by Digimon. Fascinated by a Digimon Hunt he witnesses there, Tagiru teams up with Gumdramon and starts on his way to becoming a Digimon Hunter!

<summary>Students from Tagiru`s school are disappearing one after another! Meanwhile, Tagiru and Gumdramon have sensed something moving in the Digimon realm, DigiQuartz. Following its trail, they discover someone, or something, carrying a boy from Tagiru`s school... Tagiru rushes to follow him, but then he`s attacked by Sagomon, a Digimon that looks like a kappa! As even experienced Digimon Hunters call Sagomon a tough customer, Tagiru and Gumdramon are no match for his fierce attacks...
Soon after, Tagiru confronts Sagomon again. He Digivolves Gumdramon in an attempt to capture Sagomon, but they are only pushed back further. When Taiki, who has been watching their struggle, declares "I can`t turn my back on them!", Shoutmon hears him and responds. After reloading from Taiki`s Xros Loader, Shoutmon Digivolves and gains further power through a DigiXros fusion. He then launches his attack on Sagomon! How will their battle end?!
