<name>CGI</name>
<description>Computer-generated imagery (CGI) or computer animation is the art of creating moving images via the use of computers. It is a subfield of computer graphics and animation. Increasingly it is created by means of 3D computer graphics, though 2D computer graphics are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time rendering needs. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another medium, such as film.</description>

<name>short episodes</name>
<description>Short episodes are regular episodes that are much shorter than the standard length. This means up to and including 10 minutes; shows with episodes that are 11 to 20 minutes in length are http://anidb.net/t6494 [half-length episodes] instead.
Not to be confused with http://anidb.net/t6349 [multi-segment episodes], which are regular episodes that are split into several short segments (parts), usually with separate titles and independent storylines.</description>

<name>3D CG animation</name>
<description>Abbreviation for "three-dimensional computer generated animation" or "computer graphics" (CGI). The traditional 2D art is enhanced by 3D imagery developed through computer modeling software. Done in the right way, this union of 3D in a 2D animated world can be a very beautiful relationship.
The difference lies in what lacks the traditional 2D animation all together and may give term to something produced entirely with 3D graphics (such as the 2006 remake of "Appleseed" , 2007`s "Vexille", the 2008 addition to the "Biohazard" series and the more well known "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within" and "Advent Children").</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Another third-year, Komachi is kind and shy, and likes to read books and write. However, once she is angered enough, she will snap and release her temper. Along with her best friend Karen, Komachi is also a popular senior at her school. She is a volunteer at the school library, along with Karen/Cure Aqua, and often spends her time there writing stories. Her dream is to become a writer, and she exhibits particular talent in this: Nuts praised her first completed story (upon the 7th revision), and he does not give praise lightly. She has romantic feelings for Nuts, which she expresses in the form of her second novel. Her parents own a traditional Japanese sweetshop.
The green-clad Cure Mint is the counterpart of Cure Aqua. Fans noted that her appearance is similar to Lettuce Midorikawa of Tokyo Mew Mew. She introduces herself as "Tranquility of the Green Earth, Cure Mint!"</description>

<name>Milky Rose</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>She is a cooperator of Pretty Cure that appears in Yes! PreCure 5! GoGo! Her civilian name backwards has the same pronunciation with Miruku no Mimi meaning "Milk`s ears." She has long, violet, curly hair and fuchsia eyes. When transformed, she wears violet with blue flower decorations. A calm, smart character, her cool persona acts as a mask to her bizarre personality.
She introduces herself as "The Blue Rose is The Secret Mark, Milky Rose!" (Aoi Bara ha Himitsu no Shirushi, Milky Rose!)
She is actually Milk in human form, who got her powers from a blue colored seed left behind after the events of episode 7. Milk/Kurumi can`t stay in this form for too long, as it drains her energy and reverts her back to mascot form.</description>
