<description>Many years ago, http://anidb.net/ch7032 [Azalyn]`s best friend in all the universe was a similar aged boy named Ruu. Also royalty of a sort, they shared the way that children do and both pledged that one day they would rule fairly. Both also agreed that one day they would meet again.

<description>A novel is a relatively long work of narrative fiction, normally written in prose form, and which is typically published as a book. Manga, comics, or visual novels do not fit this description and are not considered novels; including a small number of illustrations, however, is still permissible, which means that light novels are considered novels.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The 16-year-old empress of the Holy Raalgon Empire. Azalyn is a child, forced into the unenviable situation of having to assume power of the empire once her parents are murdered. Prompted by her advisors, she gives the command to attack the UPSF (assuming that they were behind the assassination plot). Having not had a chance to be a child, Azalyn must now be strong for the entire empire, and it`s a task that she is afraid of taking, but even more afraid of failing.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Lt. Commander Yuriko Star is another by-the-book officer. Yuriko joined the UPSF to give her life structure and attepts to obey the rules in almost every situation. However, she, unlike http://anidb.net/ch7036 [Yamamoto], has no problem telling http://anidb.net/ch7034 [Tylor] that he has done something wrong and will even resort to slapping him when he gets too far out of line. Yuriko also tries to downplay her gender, making herself a soldier first, and then a woman. This is a sore subject for her when someone comments about Tylor`s obvious attraction to her looks, pointing out that she has never used her appearance to get ahead; an equally sore point for her is her budding attraction to him. Yuriko is one of the most rational and level-headed officers on the http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze]. While she is senior to Yamamoto, her speciality as an intelligence officer places her outside the chain of command.</description>

<description>Justy Ueki Tylor joins the United Planets Space Force hoping for an easy ride through life but with the devil`s luck becomes a hero. He is soon promoted Lieutenant Commander and Captain of http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze]. Tylor is a irresponsible laid back captain that can always find his way out of trouble unscathed. Tylor normally allows his crew to "bend" the rules such as letting the surgeon drink while on duty. Throughout the ranks it is argued that Tylor is either the most brilliant military mind or just a lucky bafoon.</description>

<description>Kim works on the bridge as the http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze]`s communications officer. It is rumored that Kim was a fashion model prior to joining the military. She still enjoys dressing up and her urges to break out of the strict UPSF dress code cause problems between her and http://anidb.net/ch7033 [Yuriko Star]. Her hobbies include shopping and modern dance. She likes to read a women`s magazine called "Enen" in her free time, but is absolutely professional where her job is concerned.
She is cool-headed in a crisis and extremely skilled as a communications officer. She says at one point that she transfered onto the Soyokaze in order to find direction in her life, and there`s the strong possibility she did it after breaking up with a man.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Lieutenant Makoto Yamamoto is another very strait-laced, by-the-books military man. Yamamoto is the first officer on the http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze] and tried mightily to interject an air of professionalism to the outfit. Constantly enraged by http://anidb.net/ch7034 [Tylor]`s lack of discipline and his loose command of the troops, Yamamoto spends much of his free time in the medic`s office taking tranquilizers and making use of the neuro-cleanser. Yamamoto sees Tylor for what he is, a bumbling fool, but is torn between the unwritten soldier`s code of supporting and obeying your superior officer, and telling the UPSF brass what is REALLY going on. He is always on the lookout for a chance to get some form of command, hoping to get a ship of his own one day.</description>

<description>Dr. Kitaguchi maintains the understaffed and under-stocked sick bay of the http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze]. A great lover of alcohol in all its form, he even uses it to anesthetize and sterilize his patients. While only 33 years old, Kitaguchi claims to have a 30-year drinking habit and proclaims that he performs better in surgery when he`s liquored up.
With the arrival of http://anidb.net/ch7039 [Harumi], he becomes the envy of the entire male crew. He and http://anidb.net/ch7034 [Tylor] are drinking buddies, and he is one of the few crew members to gain a deep understanding of Tylor`s true nature early on. He claims the reason he became a doctor was because "it`s better than being a patient."</description>

While he appears to be a Westerner, he is actually of Japanese descent. Possessed of a self-confidence that borders on arrogance, he claims that the ship is as "safe as a cradle" when he`s at the helm. His hobbies include various types of meditation, including Zen meditation.</description>

She was sent to the UPSF by http://anidb.net/ch7044 [Ru Baraba Dom] and http://anidb.net/ch38778 [Shia Has] to kill Tylor. Instead, she succumbs to Tylor`s charm and ends up falling in love with him!</description>

They join the http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze]`s crew when Tylor is reassigned as its captain.
Desired to pilot ships, they persuade http://anidb.net/ch7042 [Kojirou] to train them (against his will of course) and discover that they have a natural piloting ability. Emi and Yumi`s close quarters with Kojirou provide them with endless amusement since he is deathly afraid of females.
Identical twins, the only way to tell them apart is by their pony tails (Yumi`s is on the left side of her head, while Emi`s is on her right) and their voices (Yumi`s is higher pitched than Emi`s). They were also childhood friends of http://anidb.net/ch7033 [Yuriko Star].</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The supremely self-confident pilot of the Ranpu-class fighter assigned to the http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze]. Known alternately as "The Samurai of Space" and "The Shoot-Down King," Kojirou graduated with honors from flight training. While he hasn`t logged that many hours of flight time, he shows deadly skill against the Raalgon forces.
Possessing an actual phobia of women, he seems to regard the Hanner sisters as a special case, no doubt owing to their own natural piloting skill. He keeps a small mascot doll the twins made for him in the cockpit of his fighter. He also gets along very poorly with the Marines.</description>

Both Tylor and Dom recognize that wars can only be won when no one fights.
He is loyal to the young empress and stands firmly in Lonawer`s camp to find a way to end the war honorably and with a minimum of bloodshed.</description>
