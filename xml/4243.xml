<recommendation type="Must See" uid="463724">Like many have already said it, I too believe this is a must watch! Unfortunately, very few anime in general can give you this tranquility, strong feelings of love and compassion toward anyone, and remembrance of tremendous and picturesque town of Neo-Venezia. Though Aria doesn`t have a strong and perplexed kind of story, I for one was left completely engulfed by it.</recommendation>

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>psychokinesis</name>
<description>The term psychokinesis (from the Greek ψυχή, "psyche", meaning mind, soul, heart, or breath; and κίνησις, "kinesis", meaning motion, movement; literally "mind-movement"), also referred to as telekinesis (Greek τῆλε + κίνησις, literally "distant-movement") with respect to strictly describing movement of matter, sometimes abbreviated PK and TK respectively, is a term coined by publisher Henry Holt to refer to the direct influence of mind on a physical system that cannot be entirely accounted for by the mediation of any known physical energy. Examples of psychokinesis could include distorting or moving an object, and influencing the output of a random number generator.
The following powers, among others, are psychokinetic powers:
- Telekinesis: movement of matter at the micro or macro (visible objects, life forms, etc.) levels; move, lift, agitate, vibrate, spin, bend, break, or impact)
-- Speed up or slow down the naturally occurring vibrations of atoms in matter to alter temperature, possibly to the point of ignition if combustible (also known as pyrokinesis when speeding up vibrations, and cryokinesis when slowing them down)
-- Self levitation (rising in the air unsupported, flying)
- Influencing events (sports, gambling, election, prolongation of life, etc.)
- Biological supernatural healing
- Teleportation (disappearing and reappearing elsewhere)
- Phasing through matter
- Electro-psychokinesis, the ability to control any and all electrical, electronic, or electro-mechanical devices such as computers, elevators, FAX machines, etc.
- Transmutation of matter
- Metamorphosis Shape-shifting
- Energy shield (force field)
- Control of magnetism
- Control of photons (light waves/particles)
- Thoughtform projection aka telepathic projection (a physically perceived person, animal, creature, object, ghostly entity, etc., created in the mind and projected into three-dimensional space and observable by others)
- Control of gravity
- Control of physical matter without physical interaction (water, air, ...)

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<description>The anime will fit this category if some or all of the action takes place on another planet which is supposedly in the same universe as Earth, not a complete fantasy world; usually there has to be some concept of space travel. The Latin name for Earth - Terra, would also pass the condition of being in the same universe as Earth. Basically, even mentioning of Earth existing or having existed would be enough. Although Moon is a moon, it also qualifies as Other Planet.</description>

<description>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war, and is often referred to as the "Red Planet" because the reddish iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>The conspiracy thriller (or paranoid thriller) is a sub-genre of the thriller which flourished in the 1970s in the US (and was echoed in other parts of the world) in the wake of a number of high-profile scandals and controversies (most notably Vietnam, the assassination of President Kennedy, Chappaquiddick and Watergate), and which exposed what many people regarded as the clandestine machinations and conspiracies beneath the orderly fabric of political life.
The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top".</description>

<name>important haircut</name>
<description>When a character cuts off his or her hair, it often symbolizes a rite of passage or bout of character growth. A princess striking out on an adventure, or a new recruit at boot camp, for instance. Hair is something that takes time and effort to grow, so parting with it voluntarily can be a powerful act.
This is particularly a big deal when women get haircuts. Yet in fiction, even an accidental hair slicing can leave a character with a surprisingly even cut.
In many religions (Western Christianity, Ancient Egyptian religion, and others) priests and/or monks cut/shave their hair. Roman Catholic nuns also tend to cut and mantain their hair short under their veils when they enter the nunneries. The cutting of one`s own hair is also a part of Buddhist mythology, specifically something done by Siddhartha himself early on in his path to enlightenment, so anime examples might draw from this as an allusion. There are also some cultures, including Native American and many Asians, where a person would cut his or her hair as an act of grief, disgrace, or even rebellion. In the Confucian tradition, hair (like the rest of your body) is considered a gift from your parents and may not be damaged without a very good reason. Furthermore, prisoners and psychiatric patients commonly have their heads shaved, often to prevent the spread of lice, but sometimes also as a demeaning measure.

These anime are not "story-less" but story is secondary to character development and the characters themselves and what they experience.</description>

<description>Magical realism is fiction that portrays magical or unreal elements as a natural part in an otherwise realistic or mundane environment, in particular when a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe. Magical realism is often associated with Latin American literature, particularly authors including Gabriel García Márquez and Isabel Allende.

Another use of narration comes in the form of a dominant voice belonging to one of the protagonists, intended only for the viewer and revealing the intimate thoughts to whom it belongs. This type of narration occurs frequently throughout the duration of the episode or movie.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Mizunashi Akari is native of Manhome (Earth) who immigrated to Aqua when she was 15 to become an undine. While not as skillful at sculling a gondola as Alice, nor as familiar with the history of her adopted city as Aika, Akari makes friends quickly and converses easily with customers and other strangers. She finds enjoyment in things or events that others think humdrum and mundane, for which Aika and Alice call her "mysterious." Akari often says "hohe" or "hahi", which is her short version of "wow."
When Akari used gondola simulations on Manhome, she accidentally learned how to row backwards and had to relearn the proper method when she started at Aria Company; however, as Aika notes, "Akari is almost invincible when she rows backwards."
She is promoted last out of three; both Alice and Aika were recently promoted to Primas. Akari received the title "Aquamarine" (遙かなる蒼[アクアマリン], Harukanaru Ao, lit. "Distant Blue") upon her promotion.</description>

Her favorite phrase is Ara Ara ("Well Well") and she frequently giggles, to Akira`s annoyance.</description>

Aika speaks bluntly and often responds to Akari`s idealistic comments with "Embarrassing remarks are not allowed!" (恥ずかしいセリフ禁止!, Hazukashii serifu kinshi!). Despite their contrasting personalities, she gets along well with Akari and http://anidb.net/ch8499 [Alice], but frequently squabbles with her mentor, http://anidb.net/ch8505 [Akira], whom she resembles.
Aika considers herself reliable, especially compared to distractable Akari and antisocial Alice, but both her friends call her a crybaby for her tendency to tear up when emotional. She is proud of her gondola skill as an undine, and can be very competitive about it.
She is promoted second out of three; Alice was recently promoted from Pair to Prima, and Akari was still a Single. Aika received the title "Rosen Queen" (薔薇の女王[ローゼン・クイーン], Bara no Joou, lit. "Queen of Roses") upon her promotion.</description>

<description>Alice is friends with Akari and Aika, the undines of Aria and Himeya, respectively. She`s an apprentice of one of the Orange Planet`s Primas - Athena - and has to split her time into going to school and rowing training. Although being only a Pair, her skill surpasses both Akari and Aika`s. They practice together despite working for rival companies.
At the beginning, she is introverted and anti-social, but she lightens up as the series progresses. She often uses dekkai (でっかい, "huge") as an intensifier.
Alice is the first undine to be promoted straight from Pair to Prima, skipping the middle "level". She is promoted first out of three; Akari and Aika were Singles at that time. Alice received the title "Orange Princess" (黄昏の姫君[オレンジ・プリンセス], Tasogare no Himegimi, lit. "Twilight Princess") upon her promotion. She sang the song http://anidb.net/s10336 [Lumis Eterne] during her Prima Undine exam.</description>

Her blade oar number is 36. She is Alice`s mentor at Orange Planet. She often appears quiet most of the time and an airhead who does not pay attention to her surroundings (in the anime, she is shown more than once forgetting to duck while rowing under a bridge), but she genuinely cares about Alice.
Athena has a strange laugh that comes out sounding as though she is angry. She was a trainee undine with Alicia and Akira, and joined them in joint practice.
Her signature song is http://anidb.net/s7270 [Barcarolle], sung by the vocalist http://anidb.net/cr3917 [Kawai Eri]. Throughout the series, Athena also features two other songs with vocals by Kawai Eri: http://anidb.net/s7258 [Coccoro] and http://anidb.net/s52857 [Lumis Eterne].</description>

<description>Akatsuki is a trainee "salamander", one of those responsible for maintaining Aqua`s weather.

Akatsuki was born in Neo-Venezia, but as he spends most of his time on the floating island he doesn`t really know very much about the city.
Akatsuki tends to be cynical and has an even shorter fuse than Aika. But although he`s grumpy and ill-tempered most of the time, he`s really a nice guy who rather likes Akari (though you`ll never see him admit it). He likes to pull on Akari`s pigtails (it`s also his favorite nickname for her).

But this time, there`s a little twist - Al, one of Neo-Venezia`s gravity-controlling Gnomes, will be there as well.  Even though he`s shorter than the girls, he`s actually three years their senior; and he knows all about physics, planets, and the beauty of the universe.  What he doesn`t seem to know, however, is how Aika feels whenever she`s with him.

Though the grounds are beautiful, there`s also a hint of mystery and danger in the air...

This day is a celebration of an ages-old story on Manhome, about a knight whose love for his lady lived on after his death in the form of a rose.  In Neo-Venezia, that means that women everywhere receive roses from the people who admire them.  Akatsuki wants to give Alicia as many roses as he can, but he`s too nervous to deliver them (even though he`d never admit it).  Will Akari be able to help?

This sparks a fire in Aika and Alice as well - they`ve decided to compete to see which one of them knows the most hidden wonders in Neo-Venezia.

Following President Aria in a haze, Akari wanders into a mysterious cafe, with a very unusual clientele...

Even worse, Athena interferes by trying to help out.  Alice`s self-imposed challenge is something that she must conquer alone, or so she thinks; but maybe there`s more to success than just doing everything by yourself.

<summary>The whole town is sizzling in a strong summer heat wave, and the girls are doing the best they can to beat the heat.  But then, Akari spots a woman dressed all in black, with even her face covered with a thick black veil.  Aika tells Akari a Manhome legend about the spirit of a woman dressed in black, who was angered that she couldn`t be buried on San Michele Island.  Supposedly the ghost spirits away any gondolier foolish enough to take her on board... but that`s only an old story, right?

<summary>Heavy rain keeps the girls from their usual gondola practice, so instead they spend the day at Himeya.  They start off studying at first, but when their minds drift off to what nicknames they`ll take as Primas, Akira steps in and gives them some good old-fashioned paperwork to do.  Even that can`t get Aika down, however... because she`s noticed lately that people whisper to each other when she walks past.  Does that mean she`s finally being recognized for her skills as an Undine?

<summary>As snow softly covers Neo-Venezia, Akari and Alicia are out for a walk.  Akari asks Alicia what she thought as a child - back then, what did she want to be like when she grew up?

As they walk around the city pushing the snowball, it grows bigger and bigger, to the point where people remark on it everywhere they go.  Alicia only continues to smile, but it`s certain that her answer is hidden there somewhere.
