<description>In this Earth, there exists unknown underground world, the Inner World. In the world, there are braves who fight with large spiders, and they are called Spider Riders.
According to his grandfather`s diary, a boy, Hunter Steel is traveling around. Meanwhile he happens to enter the Inner World from a pyramid. There, the war between the insect squad that aims at conquest of the Inner World and Spider Riders continues.
Oracle, the fairly of the Inner World, summons Hunter because he thinks Hunter will be the messiah of the world. However, the powers of Oracle are sealed by Mantid who is the rule of the Insecter. For the peace of the Inner World, he has to find four sealed keys of Oracle to retrieve Oracle`s power.
Hunter asks Spider Shadow, which is a big spider chosen by Oracle, to become a member of Spider Riders to fight against enemies.

<name>Hunter Steele</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A boy who falls into the subterranean Inner World, and becomes a Spider Rider with his new found battle spider "partner", Shadow. They both argue quite a lot, mainly because of Hunter`s cluelessness, ignorance and Shadow`s pride and desire to work alone as well as the belief that he doesn`t need the help of others. It is unknown whether the prophecy refers to him, thus it is unknown of he is destined to be Arachna`s salvation or its destruction. It is also shown in the TV series that he has affections for Corona and admires her good spirit but is too shy to share them. In the episode "Smells Like Team Spider," he unknowingly stares at Corona while she is marveling at the flowers. When they are battling the Invectids, his mind is calmed by the image of Corona`s face. Lastly, when Igneous asks what changed Hunter`s mind about the flowers, he becomes a bit embarrassed as it was Corona`s image that changed him. Also, since Corona was the first person to discover Hunter, he has known her for the longest time, besides Shadow. Hunter may have a romantic relationship with Corona and their spiders might too. He also caught Corona in her sleeping shirt once in which she threw her pillow at him. In order for Hunter to return home, he must become an Arachna master. Hunter`s grandfather Digger Steele was also a Spider Rider and an earthen. Digger Steele knew the hero Quake. Hunter`s weapon is an Axial Pike. His catchphrase and motto is, "Never Give Up!"</description>

<name>Corona</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Discovering Hunter and Shadow, she escorts the new team to Arachna so they may be officially inducted to the ranks of the Spider Riders. She seems to care a lot for Hunter, as does her spider for Shadow. She might also have a romantic relationship with Hunter too. She grows (using her power) most of the time when Hunter is deeply in fight and gets hurt. This proves that she could be the Oracle`s chosen one just like Aqune. She becomes especially worried when Hunter is hurt or in danger and becomes quite jealous when Hunter`s guy nature foolishly allows him to mention spending some time the night before with an unknown girl (Princess Sparkle) by pushing him into the fountain he slept next to that night. In "Hunter`s Holiday" Corona clearly expresses her desire to spend some time with Hunter alone but when he refuses she takes out her rage by practicing on targets with Hunter`s face on them.At the last episode,She say "My Hunter." Though she is taller and more mature than Hunter, both are the same age (stated to be eleven, though they act around twelve to thirteen years old). She and her battle spider, Venus, make a great team. She has no family and was adopted by twins. When they found her, Corona had a manacle. It was revealed that she is Aqune`s long lost sister and that they are both "Oracle Handmaids". Her weapons are a bow and arrows.</description>

<name>Igneous</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A leading Spider Rider and captain of the Arachna military. His name mirrors Magma`s—when magma cools, it becomes igneous rock. Igneous is calm, gentle and has quite a strategic mind. Igneous takes Hunter`s training seriously and almost acts as a mentor to Hunter, to his annoyance. He challenged Hunter and Shadow to a duel when they joined the Riders, but it was only to see if Hunter could cooperate with Shadow. Igneous was part of the Arachna Knights, where he teamed up with a long-time friend Slate. Both were known as "Claw" and "Fang" and they proved to be quite powerful, especially since Igneous didn`t call his spider Flame to assist. Regardless of his grade, Igneous is proud to serve the royalty of the Arachna Kingdom, and always offer his help to prince Lumen and princess Sparkle. His weapon is a cavalry lance and one of his attacks is a flamethrower coming out of the tip of the lance. He has a crush on the Queen of Nuuma, Illuma. Igneous had a fan club of Arachna`s castle`s females, but while he was away to Nuuma, they had found boyfriends, leaving him crushed. He is also afraid of ghosts, but won`t admit it and says they don`t exist.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Leader of the Spider Riders and prince of Arachna. He is rather lazy for a ruler, preferring diplomatic solutions over fights, even against the Invectid. Some say it is because his spider, Ebony, is so powerful that he is afraid to let it loose. He would much rather negotiate with the enemy, and only fight when absolutely needed. Lumen is bright, loquacious, and loves cute girls. Ebony, his spider, also loves to talk and always advises Lumen on how to rule Arachna, his battle technique, and on dating! His weapon is a sword.</description>

<description>Lumen`s younger sister, also a Spider Rider. She is the one who points out that Hunter might save, not destroy, the Inner World. She also visits Hunter in the night and advises him to bond with Shadow and when Hunter first sees her, he blushes while she giggles. Sparkle is very adventurous. Her spider is Hotarla, and is very small. Her weapon of choice is a yo yo-like device, with which she pummeled Grasshop to submission when he was trying to get away with one of the keys. She was the first one to trust Grasshop, causing him to change his ways. She is also the only one who calls him "Uncle Hop".</description>

<description>Not affiliated with the Arachna military, he is a "lone rider" with his partner, Brutus. He made a promise to find the purple spider Portia, supposed to be Brutus`s younger sister, and this promise keeps him joining the ranks of Arachna. He later joins up with Hunter and the others to prevent the Invectids from stealing the Oracle Keys. He is somewhat obsessed with rescuing Portia from the Invectids. Magma is a great admirer of the hero Quake; each time he sees Quake in action, he has tears streaming from his eyes. His weapon is a mace that can switch to a flail.</description>

<description>Hunter`s spider (though Shadow disagrees in the beginning), a prideful warrior who thinks he doesn`t need a rider and is also very stubborn and won`t admit when he`s wrong, especially one who may be destined to bring disaster to Arachna (i.e., Hunter). He hates large crowds. He is said to have legendary strength. He complains about most of the things Hunter does, though they make a very good team. Shadow is a direct descendant of the Ancestral Lord of Spiders. Shadow cares for Venus.</description>
