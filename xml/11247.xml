<description>Dragon Cry is a magic artifact, enshrined within a temple in the Kingdom of Fiore. The artifact, that has enough power to destroy the world, was stolen by traitor of the kingdom, Zash, and delivered to the king of Kingdom of Stella, Animus. The request of recapturing Dragon Cry was accepted by the Mages from Fairy Tail: Natsu, Lucy, Happy, Gray, Erza, Wendy and Carla; whilst in the midst of chasing Zash, they infiltrate the Kingdom of Stella. During their mission, they meet Animus` aid, Sonya...
What does Animus plan to do with Dragon Cry? Sonya wants to save her country, what secret is she hiding? Within the interlacing ulterior motives, Fairy Tail fights against the danger that is the menacing world!
And in the middle of this heroic battle, Natsu`s instinct awakens...?!
This is the second movie based on the manga and anime series Fairy Tail, by Hiro Mashima. The movie premiered in Japan on May 6, 2017 and was released on DVD/Blu-Ray on November 17, 2017. In North America, the movie has been licensed by Funimation and will be released March 6, 2018.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>belly dance</name>
<description>Belly dance is any solo, improvised dance based on torso articulation originating from the Middle East. Belly dance takes many different forms depending on region, both in costume and dance style, and new styles have evolved in the West as its popularity has spread globally. In the Middle East, belly dance has two functions: as a social dance, it is performed by ordinary men and women of all ages at celebrations and social gatherings, although in more traditional societies such occasions are gender segregated, with separate parties for men and women; as an art, professionals perform it with an emphasis on stagecraft and special costumes designed to show off the movements to best effect, but they are not seen as respectable in the Middle East, with a strong social stigma attached to female dancers in particular, since the display of their bodies in public is considered sinful.

<description>Lucy Heartfilia is the main female protagonist and viewpoint character of Fairy Tail.
According to http://anidb.net/cr7578 [Mashima Hiro], her given name was inspired by The Beatles song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds".
She is a 17-year-old wizard who specializes in summoning celestial spirits from another realm using a set of keys called Gatekeys, and treats them like her friends. She also carries a whip as her personal weapon, which she wields on occasion to fight alongside her spirits.
As one of the saner members of the guild, Lucy regularly gawks at the odd habits of her guildmates, who frequently show up uninvited inside her house.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Natsu Dragneel, also known by the nickname "Salamander" (火竜), is the main male protagonist of Fairy Tail.
Aside from performing missions for his guild, Natsu travels with his partner http://anidb.net/ch11802 [Happy] in search of Igneel, a dragon who raised Natsu in his youth before disappearing seven years prior to the start of the series.
He is a Dragon Slayer (滅竜魔導士), a wizard who can perform an ancient form of magic, or "Lost Magic", that grants him the physical properties of a dragon. He specializes in a particular form of this magic called Fire Dragon Slayer magic (火の滅竜魔法), which gives him powers such as breathing fire, emitting flames from any part of his body to attack his opponent, being physically immune to fire, and ingesting any flame besides his own for nourishment.
Natsu is generally carefree and reckless in nature, and causes most of the collateral damage Fairy Tail is blamed for. However, he is extremely loyal to his guildmates and attacks anyone who tries to harm or insult them. Although he comes across as thick-headed to several other characters, he is a perceptive tactician in battle and can quickly deduce his opponents` strengths and weaknesses.
He suffers from motion sickness when riding on vehicles of any sort (trains, carriages, boats, etc.), as well as when carried by others. The only exception to this rule is Happy, who Natsu claims is his friend and not a "moving object".

<description>Happy is a 6-year-old talking cat with blue fur who serves as Natsu`s best friend and initial partner before Lucy`s inclusion in the Fairy Tail guild.
http://anidb.net/cr7578 [Mashima Hiro] originally planned to name him "Freyr" after the Norse god, but found the name did not fit his character.
Happy possesses a magical ability called Aera (翼), which allows him to temporarily grow white feathered wings on his back and fly. He is only able to carry up to one person at a time in this form.
He is generally cheerful as per his name, and often utters the catchphrase "Aye!" (あい) or "Aye, sir!" (あいさ).

While normally calm and collected, Gray has a fierce rivalry with http://anidb.net/ch11801 [Natsu] due to their opposing magic types, which constantly leads the two to bicker and insult each other.
