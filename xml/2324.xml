<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="82150">Just an edit to some songs of Minmey. If you`re her fan, watch the whole thing, if not, skip to the last 5 minutes for some new footage that serves as an epilogue of sorts. Nice addition, but still kind of lazy as an OVA.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="388774">A must see and have for any Macross fan, great music remastered more a few futuristc scenes at last song.</recommendation>

<description>This half-hour music video consists for the most part of clips from http://anidb.net/a77 [the TV series] and http://anidb.net/a996 [the movie] set to various http://anidb.net/ch7418 [Lynn Minmay] songs. As far as the story goes, nine months have passed since the end of the TV series; in those nine months, http://anidb.net/ch21733 [the SDF-1 Macross] has been repaired and is nearly fully restored. In the meantime, construction has finished on the new SDF-2 Megaroad-01. Serving as the captain is http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa], who has married http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru]. As the fleet prepares to launch, Minmay gives her last concert in Macross City. Hikaru tests the new VF-4 Lightning III variable fighter, and Minmay packs for her trip. After having one last look at the concert hall, she boards the Megaroad-01, which takes off from Earth and heads out into space to spread out the human race.
The footage used in this music video was originally meant to be the ending for the movie, but it wasn`t quite ready; the footage used here updates the old TV designs and makes them fit with what is seen later in http://anidb.net/a67 [Macross Plus].

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>space opera</name>
<description>Space opera is a sub-genre of fiction that emphasizes romantic adventures in space. Space opera generally involves large-scale conflicts between opponents with powerful abilities and technology. The genre will often be melodramatic, sometimes playing music that can be nothing short of awesome. Warfare and a battle of wits are usually less emphasized, preferring romance (with exceptions, e.g. Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu). Some space operas tend to be formulaic and sometimes even prosaic, often employing very simple devices and somewhat obvious strategies. An example of this would be the infamous laws of physics in the Macross universe, in which the main male lead will hardly ever get hit in battle.</description>

<description>Born in Yokohama Chinatown, Japan (though she is of partial Chinese descent) as Linn Minmei, Minmay moved in with her uncle http://anidb.net/ch21740 [Shaochin] and aunt http://anidb.net/ch21741 [Feichun] on South Ataria Island in hopes of finding the path to fulfill her dream of becoming a star. On the day of the Zentradi invasion, she meets http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] and a series of events leads to her being swept off on the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] along with the rest of the surviving population from that island. While on the space fortress, Minmay wins the Miss Macross beauty pageant and is propelled into celebrity.When the Macross returns to Earth, she is the only civilian allowed off the space fortress. After her trip home in Japan (where her parents remained), Minmay returned to the fortress with her cousin http://anidb.net/ch10513 [Lynn Kaifun] (and http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru]`s competition for her affection) in tow. Her beauty and singing talent also win over several Zentradi spies sent to explore human society, who spread their impressions among their fleetmates, thus unwittingly evoking peace-oriented attitudes among the alien aggressors. Ultimately, Minmay sings the songs that end the first war against the Zentradi.
During the second part of the series, the very fame and success she craved finally left her tired and virtually alone. She tries to run away from her celebrity status and start anew, with a more simple life alongside http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru], who is now more confused than ever in defining his feelings for Minmay and http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa]; all of this while new conflicts arise between the human and Zentradi survivors of the first war. At the end of the series both http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] and Minmay realize they are very different people, and Minmay accepts that http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] belongs with http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Misa], remaining a friend to the couple afterwards.
In 2012, she embarks on the SDF-2 Megaroad-01 colony ship, which disappears 4 years later during its voyage towards the center of the Milky Way galaxy, becoming a legend in the Macross universe since then.Source: wiki</description>

<description>Hayase Misa is of Japanese ethnicity. She was born into a Japanese family with a hundred-year military lineage and was the only daughter of Admiral http://anidb.net/ch10525 [Hayase Takashi]. Misa also had aspired to enter the military since childhood. This dream was bolstered by a desire to join her boyfriend and first love, http://anidb.net/ch10524 [Riber Fruhling], in the UN Spacy. Misa`s hope is tragically unrealized as http://anidb.net/ch10524 [Riber] dies during the destruction of the return fleet from the Salla Mars Base where he was stationed, shortly after leaving Misa on Earth.
After graduating first in her class at the UN Spacy Officers` Academy, she earned a bridge post aboard the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross]. She and fellow SDF-1 bridge officer http://anidb.net/ch10509 [Claudia LaSalle] became close friends. As Misa herself admits, her mind is constantly preoccupied with duty. This changes, however, after she meets the young pilot http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru]. Their officer/subordinate status would slowly evolve through the series, from originally a difficult professional relationship (with http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] even calling her "old lady" when he first hears her over his Valkyrie`s onboard radio, which results in his senpai, http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker], getting a good laugh, much to Misa`s chagrin) to a friendly personal one; and much later to a romantic one, clashing with the already strong infatuation http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] has with http://anidb.net/ch7418 [Lynn Minmay]. She also has some short-lived feelings for http://anidb.net/ch7418 [Minmay]`s cousin http://anidb.net/ch10513 [Kaifun], who bears a striking physical resemblance to the deceased http://anidb.net/ch10524 [Riber].
Initially ranked as First Lieutenant, she is later promoted to Captain, and later to Major, concluding with her being chosen as the commander of the new SDF-2 Megaroad-01 ship and crew.
Despite having early disputes with http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru], she slowly begins to harbor feelings for him as they share some adventures during the war, discovering both have very much in common. In the final episode, http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] realizes he is in love with Misa, and after the climactic final battle, they marry and become members of the SDF-2 Megaroad-01 crew to leave on a stellar exploration mission in 2012. Shortly thereafter, Misa and http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] have a daughter, Ichijou Miku, in 2013.
After their ship disappears in 2016 without a trace near the center of the galaxy, they were reported as missing. The whereabouts of Misa and http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] and the ship`s crew (includinghttp://anidb.net/ch7418 [ Lynn Minmay], who remained as their friend and also joined the exploration mission) are still unknown.Source: wiki</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Roy Focker is an American who was born and lived in the United States in the late 20th century. During his college school days he had interest in prehistorical civilizations and archeology studies, and was in a relationship with his senior http://anidb.net/ch14115 [Aries Turner]. However, after being left by her, Roy dropped his studies and became a stunt pilot in the air circus led by http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru]`s father. Some time later he decided to join the U.N. Spacy after most of his friends died in the U.N. Wars. His flight instructor during this time was D.D. Ivanov.
During the war Roy became a talented and strong-willed fighter pilot, known for his love of women and alcohol. Focker was selected later as one of the first test pilots for the development of the variable fighters by the U.N. Forces. In 2008 he is deployed as a squadron commader with the Skull Team aboard the stealth carrier CVN-99 Asuka II on a secret mission in the South Pacific and flies the VF-0 Phoenix in battle against the SV-51s of the Anti-U.N. Forces. The work done on the VF-0 helps the coinciding development of the VF-1 Valkyrie.
Despite his long absence during the U.N. Wars and the death of http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru]`s father, http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] still remained a close friend to Roy and considered him his sempai (upperclassman/big brother figure). After the end of the U.N. Wars, Focker involved himself in the VF-X development project flying both the VF-X and the VF-X-1 (non-transformable and transformable flight test prototypes of the VF-1 Valkyrie), and his flight experience earned him the command of the VF-1 Skull Squadron aboard the super-large-scale semi-submersible attack aircraft carrier http://anidb.net/ch48774 [CVS-101 Prometheus].
During Space War I Roy Focker is still a smoking, drinking womanizer who constantly defies death and, when not on another desperate mission, enjoys life and its pleasures to the fullest. He has a relationship with http://anidb.net/ch10509 [Claudia LaSalle], an officer stationed on the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] bridge.Roy dies in episode 18 ("Pineapple Salad"), from wounds sustained while defending http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] from http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia Fallyna]`s force of Queadluun-Rau battle suits. Instead of going to the hospital to treat his wounds, he chooses to play the guitar while waiting for http://anidb.net/ch10509 [Claudia LaSalle] to finish her pineapple salad; while she`s cooking for him, he collapses from a sudden internal bleeding and passes away few minutes later. To http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru]`s chagrin given his then shaken self-confidence in his flying skill in war, he is promoted as the new leader of Roy`s squadron, using his mecha as well.
In http://anidb.net/a996 [The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?] 1984 film adaptation of the original TV series, the character Roy Focker dies aboard an alien Zentradi ship while fighting http://anidb.net/ch10516 [Quamzin Kravshera]. In the movie Roy sacrifices himself to let both http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru] and http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa] escape.Source: wiki</description>

<description>Max Jenius was born in Europe. He is a young fighter pilot, having joined http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru]`s Vermillion Team, along with http://anidb.net/ch10508 [Kakizaki Hayao], at the age of only 16. Jenius shows in his first sortie that he is a preternaturally talented ace pilot who is near invincible in combat, despite his need to wear corrective lenses on duty. Max is quickly recognized as the top pilot of the force, as marked by being granted to distinctively repaint his mecha into his preferred blue color.
Jenius` skill at piloting mecha becomes even more celebrated with feats that no other pilot would have thought of, much less achieved. One outstanding incident involves his infiltrating a Zentradi battleship in his valkyrie and disguising it with a Zentradi uniform, allowing him to escape detection.
Jenius is not above an occasional egotistical musing when he is off duty, but he also respects his comrades and they return the favor. He is also an incurable romantic in his youth which shows when he meets his future wife. That occurred when the top Zentradi ace pilot, http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia Fallyna], hears about a formidable pilot aboard the humans` http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] space fortress and seeks to challenge him personally in battle. Max manages to defeat http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] not once, but thrice. The first in their respective mechas, the second in simulated combat (a video game) and finally in a knife fight to the death. It is this final fight where the two rivals fall in love. Immediately after the knife-fight in the park Max proposes to http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] who accepts. Afterward, http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] is allowed to join the mainline fighting forces of the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] and becomes Max`s wingmate on duty, piloting a distinctive red Valkyrie alongside Max`s blue one.
After the Zentradi Fleet that nearly destroys the Earth is vanquished, Max and http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] settle down in the new city built around the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] and begin a new life together. In March 2011, they give birth to a daughter (the first of seven) named Komilia Maria Fallyna Jenius. The name Komilia (which means "Little Milia") is chosen because with her green hair and green eyes, she looks so much like her mother (although it has also been suggested that the "ko" simply refers to the Japanese kanji character "child" that is often used on the end of Japanese female personal names - a suggestion which is supported by the title of episode 30: Viva Maria, as opposed to Viva Komilia). Komilia proves how related the Humans and Zentradi are. The "first stellar interracial child" is very unabashed baby, and proves resilient to http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia]`s sometimes rough and inexperienced handling. Max, despite his relatively young age, proves to be a happy and successful father, although he clearly has a strong dislike of Komilia`s playfulness with his hair. http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa] and http://anidb.net/ch10509 [Claudia La Salle] find Komilia adorable and are amazed that she isn`t shy at all, and envy Max and http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] for having such a beautiful child.
Max and his family play a crucial role in the U.N.` capture of a factory satellite in November 2011. After blasting their way into the enemy command ship, Max and http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] proudly display their child, cradled in http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia]`s arms and wearing a tiny pink and white spacesuit, to the hostile Zentradi. Max smiles as http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] explains that Komilia "was created by the two of us...". The hostile Zentradi, who have had no exposure to human culture and have never seen a baby before, become terrified of Komilia and flee in fear, causing chaos aboard the command ship and disorder throughout the enemy fleet. This allows the earth forces and the allied Zentradi to seize the factory.
In the original Macross series, Max and http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] have seven natural daughters and adopt a Zentradi girl over a period of twenty years from 2011 to 2031. The oldest is Komilia Maria Fallyna Jenius, who is the only one seen in the original series. The youngest is http://anidb.net/ch14046 [Mylene Flare Jenius], who becomes a major character in http://anidb.net/a442 [Macross 7]. http://anidb.net/ch41428 [Emilia Jenius] is seen briefly in http://anidb.net/a443 [Macross 7 the Movie: The Galaxy`s Calling Me!].----------
In http://anidb.net/a996 [The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?], an animated film adaptation of the original series, Max and http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia] met in a completely different way. After the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] returns to Earth, the Meltrandi, under the command of Lap Lamiz, launched their own campaign against the Macross. The Meltrandi fleet sends in their highly trained http://anidb.net/ch49048 [Queadluun-Rau] power armor fighters, led by their ace pilot, http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia Fallyna], to retrieve a Protoculture tablet containing an ancient song they believed could help them defeat their Zentradi enemies. In the ensuing battle with the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] and subsequent death of http://anidb.net/ch10508 [Kakizaki Hayao], Max and http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia] fight against each other. In the last phase of the battle, Max and http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia] enter the Lap Lamiz`s ship and there, Max manages to down his opponent. Upon breaching the armor, Max is enamored by http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia] as she is with him, and expresses his awe at the Meltran pilot.
In the final battle between http://anidb.net/ch49057 [Boddole Zer] and the Macross fleet, a macronized Max is seen with http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia] battling together in their respective specialized blue and red http://anidb.net/ch49048 [Queadluun-Raus]. This scene is one of the few scenes showing Max without his glasses.
Another difference in the movie is that after http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker]`s death, Max is promoted to leader of the Skull Squadron, thus having Hikaru Ichijyo and http://anidb.net/ch10508 [Kakizaki Hayao] briefly as his subordinates.Source: wiki</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Bruno J. Global is of Italian ethnicity. Before commanding the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross], Global`s commanding officer during the U.N. Wars was http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa]`s father. He was the captain of the U.N. Navy submarine Marco Polo and the UN Spacy Oberth class space destroyer Goddard, which engaged and destroyed her hijacked sister ship Tsiolkovsky in the first ever use of reaction weaponry in real ship-vs-ship space combat during the U.N. Wars. Bruno J. Global rose through the ranks of the United Nations Forces thanks to his exploits during the Unification Wars until he was assigned as Captain of the flagship of the infant Spacy, the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] fortress.
During the skirmishes of Space War I, Global came up with various strategies (with a little help from First Lieutenant http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa]) to evade the Zentradi, rather than attacking them head-on. The most tragic event under his command came with the collapse of the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross]` ill-fated omnidirectional barrier, wiping out a large city in the Ontario region. The event caused a wider rift between him and the U.N., leading to the temporary exile of the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] from Earth. Eventually, when http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia Fallyna] of the http://anidb.net/ch10537 [Lap Lamiz] fleet defected to the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] and wished to marry http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Maximilian Jenius], Global gave them permission, and by doing so made the first true step toward peace with the Zentradi.
After Space War I, he took an administrative position in the U.N. Government and designed the Human Emigration Project, a space colonization scheme followed by the U.N. for the following years to ensure the survival of mankind and its culture in case of further appearances of Zentradi and Supervision Army fleets. In the Macross continuity he became an admiral as well as commander of the U.N. Spacy after the battle against http://anidb.net/ch17601 [Boddole Zer]. He survives the Macross series to become U.N. Representative in 2014, and retires from the Spacy as a full Admiral.
He married Miho Global in March 2003. It`s unknown if they had any children, or if they survived the Battle with the http://anidb.net/ch17601 [Boddole Zer] Main Fleet.Source: wiki</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Milia Fallyna is an ace http://anidb.net/ch48911 [Quimeliquola Queadluun-Rau] power armor pilot, a female of the giant race of warriors known as the Zentradi. Serving on board an all-female ship in the http://anidb.net/ch10537 [Lap Lamiz] fleet, she joined Commander http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai Kridanik]`s investigation of the "miclones" of Earth, and their spacecraft, the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross]. After being beaten in a pitched battle against the human pilot http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Maximilian Jenius,] she volunteered for micloning and, reduced to human size, infiltrated the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross]. Rather than espionage, her real aim was to find and kill the man who had humiliated her. At a video game arcade, she again finds herself unbeatable until she is challenged to a duel by http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max], an incredibly skilled pilot and the pilot whom Milia had dueled against in real combat. Milia concludes (correctly) that http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] must be the ace pilot which she faced in real combat. http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] asks Milia out on a date, and Milia accepts although she secretly plots to kill him. Later, when http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] meets with her in a park, Milia reveals that she is a Zentradi and tries to kill him with a knife. After a short fight, http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] disarms her. Beaten for a third time, she falls to her knees, begins to cry and asks http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] to kill her. Yet, despite everything that has occurred, http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] puts his finger under her chin and the two look into each other`s eyes for a long moment. It is then that Milia has a revelation: that the emotion http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] had awoken in her was not hate, but love. The two seem to float towards each other and then passionately kiss. They are then quickly married and Milia puts her life as a Zentradi warrior behind her, choosing instead to live with http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max].
After defecting to the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] and marrying http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max], Milia was allowed to become a member of the UN Spacy in her own right and piloted a red-painted http://anidb.net/ch48789 [VF-1J Valkyrie] Fighter into battle thereafter as her husband`s wingmate. However, caring for her own people, she convinced http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] and the other pilots to capture, rather than kill, their Zentradi opponents. This deed actually saved the ship during an all out attack by her race to destroy the ship as it, among other events, led to mutiny in the Zentradi forces severe enough for Commander http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] to call a cease fire.Source: wiki</description>

<description>For thousands of millennia, an ancient war raged across the Milky Way Galaxy unbeknownst to the human race. In July 1999, that war came to humanity`s doorstep when a super-light-velocity spaceship crash-landed on Earth. The United Nations commences an investigation of the crash site located on South Ataria Island in the North Pacific Ocean. The spacecraft is given the code name Alien StarShip-1 (ASS-1) and investigations in the months following the crash uncover startling discoveries. Giant aliens, some five times the size of a human, crewed the craft which is revealed to be a warship; a Gun Destroyer from a faction called the Supervision Army. Most important of any discovery found in the alien spacecraft is the advanced technology contained within it. Given the name "OverTechnology," the United Nations Government (U.N.G) coordinates research quickly to understand it.
In 2001, several countries including Japan, United States, Russia, Germany, Britain, and France collaborate to establish an alien technology research institute called OTEC. Less than a year later, the OTEC commences a project to restore and reconstruct the ASS-1 to be commissioned as a capital ship for the newly formed United Nations Government. From February 2001 forward, the spacecraft is designated as the SDF-1; Super-Dimension-Fortress-1. Incredible advances are made from the research including the thermonuclear reaction system used to power the craft, the gravity control system, the space fold system for traveling faster-than-light and the super-dimension-energy cannons, the main weapon of the SDF-1. These technologies are adapted quickly and soon OverTechnology is being utilized in dozens of industries, notably super-small-scale thermonuclear reactors and the development of thermonuclear reaction bombs. Despite these unprecedented leaps of progress, many problems arise and threaten to undermine the launch of the SDF-1.
Originally set to launch in 2006, civil unrest abroad and the outbreak of the Anti-Unification Wars slows the SDF-1 restoration project. Eventually, the "UN Wars" cease on January 20th 2007 and the SDF-1 is rescheduled for launch in February 2009. It is the day of the launching ceremony that the opposing faction of the ancient war tracks the residual energies left by the ASS-1`s space fold and follow it to the Sol system. The newly christened SDF-1 Macross, armed with a heretofore undiscovered automated defense system, activates in response to the approaching enemy forces known as the Zentradi. The main cannon of the SDF-1 Macross fires from the surface of the Earth and destroys two Zentradi ships some 280,000 km out in space. The remaining Zentradi retaliate and intense fighting ensues. In an attempt to maneuver and regain the initiative, Captain http://anidb.net/ch10507 [Bruno J. Global] activates the space fold system to transport the SDF-1 Macross into Lunar orbit. Due to limited human understanding of the space fold system and improper instrumentation, the SDF-1 Macross folds far beyond the Moon, transporting the ship and much of the surrounding surface of South Ataria Island out past Pluto. This single engagement initiates the beginning of Space War I between the UN Spacy and the Zentradi.Over the length of more than a year during which Space War I is fought, the SDF-1 Macross travels from the outskirts of the Sol system back to Earth, fighting the forces of the Zentradi. The Zentradi are determined to capture the vessel, obsessed with the secrets of the ship`s obvious reconstruction and reaction weapons. This advantage allows the Macross to effectively use it`s formidable defenses, thwarting many attempts to be captured by the enemy. After Space War I ends on March 10th 2010, the Macross landing site is chosen as home for the reconstruction of Macross City. The Macross takes part in one more major engagement against rogue Zentradi Kamjin Kravshera`s forces during the Defensive Battle of Macross City in January 2012. Despite extensive damage following the battle, the Macross is repaired and undergoes a major refit. To this day, the Macross remains the home of the U.N. Military Command Center and is berthed in Macross City on Earth.

Another product of the war machines used during the ancient Schism War of the old Galactic Empire, the Quiltra-Queleual serves the role of a planetary assault ship. More than any of the other Zentradi capital ships, this vessel devotes the vast majority of internal volume to mecha bays and hangars for battle pods, fighters and re-entry craft. The ship features several launching hatches for efficient deployment including a large re-entry pod hatch. While not specifically designed for ship-to-ship combat, the Quiltra-Queleual still features a moderate number of anti-ship and anti-fighter weapons for attack and defense.

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>After the crash-landing of the Alien StarShip-One in July 1999 it is discovered the alien crew was a race of giants some five times the size of a human. Fearful of being unprepared for a conflict with these aliens, the newly formed United Nations Government (UNG) begins researching anti-giant weapon systems technologies. Utilizing the now named OverTechnology found on the ASS-1, the non-variable humanoid mecha called the Destroid is designed; another weapon system is the transformable Battroid. The UNG contracts Stonewell and Bellcom to develop an all-environment variable fighter eventually known as the "Valkyrie." Rising to the challenge, Stonewell and Bellcom subcontract with OT reaction powerplant producer Shinnakasu Heavy Industry and Destroid developer Centinental to complete a basic design by 2005. The first transformable prototype is successfully tested in 2007 and the UNG decides to formally adopt the Valkyrie in November of that year. By late 2008, mass production is in full swing on the VF-1A variable fighter.
From February 2009 to March 2010, the VF-1A Valkyrie served as the standard variable fighter of the U.N. Spacy in Space War I. The VF-1 proved to be an extremely capable craft, successfully combating a variety of Zentradi mecha even in most sorties which saw UN Spacy forces significantly outnumbered. The versatility of the Valkyrie design enabled the variable fighter to act as both large-scale infantry and as air/space superiority fighter. The signature skills of U.N. Spacy ace pilot http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Maximilian Jenius] exemplified the effectiveness of the variable systems as he near-constantly transformed the Valkyrie in battle to seize advantages of each mode as combat conditions changed from moment to moment. The basic VF-1 was deployed in four minor variants (designated A, D, J, and S) and its success was increased by continued development of various enhancements including the GBP-1S "Armored" Valkyrie and FAST Pack "Super" Valkyrie weapon systems.
After the end of Space War I, the VF-1A continued to be manufactured both in the Sol system (notably on the Lunar facility Apollo Base) and throughout the UNG space colonies. Although the VF-1 would eventually be replaced as the primary VF of the UN Spacy by the VF-4 Lightning III in 2020, a long service record and continued production after the war proved the lasting worth of the design. The VF-1A was without doubt the most recognizable variable fighter of Space War I and was seen as a vibrant symbol of the U.N. Spacy even into the first year of the New Era 0001 in 2013. At the end of 2015 the final rollout of the VF-1 was celebrated at a special ceremony, commemorating this most famous of variable fighters.

<description>A variant to the standard VF-1 Valkyrie, the variable fighter "D" is a two-seater version that features two TV camera "eye" systems within the head unit and slightly upgraded firepower via a second Mauler RÖV-20 anti-aircraft laser cannon. Manufactured by the VF-1 designer Stonewell and Bellcom, the VF-1D ironically saw the fewest compliment of the main four VF-1 variants aboard the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross], but nonetheless was an active-service variable fighter. A number of VF-1D units were also deployed as advanced training variable fighters, for live weapons and full combat functionality instruction. A VF-1D unit designated VT-102 was one such example with the label "Stud Seat" (Student) and "INST CAPT. DAGGER" (Instructor) found upon the exterior of the cockpit (this was the same variable fighter flown by then civilian pilot http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru] in February 2009).

<description>Shinnakasu Heavy Industry`s VF-1J (the "J" speculated as a prideful designation of the fighter`s region of origin) is an upgraded version of the standard VF-1, typically assigned to the senior officer of an air team or to a squadron leader. Unlike Stonewell/Bellcom`s VF-1D, the VF-1J remains a single seat fighter but shares the slightly increased firepower of that variant. The new head unit of the VF-1J (developed by Kyuusei Industry) features two Mauler RÖV-20 anti-aircraft laser cannons in a slightly improved configuration. Naturally, when the Shinnakasu-designed GBP-1S "Armored" system was given first operational deployment, it was installed on a VF-1J.

<description>The final of the four minor VF-1 variants, the VF-1S carries the heaviest weapon load of the standard variable fighter. Manufactured only in limited numbers, Northrom also enlisted Kyuusei Industry to design a new head unit for their own variant. The VF-1S mounts four of the Mauler series RÖV-20 anti-aircraft laser cannons and enjoys several upgrades in addition to firepower. The engines are improved Shinnakasu Heavy Industry/P&amp;W/Roice FF-2001D models resulting in measurably improved thrust and an enhanced avionics package is featured in each VF-1S. While usually reserved for CAGs (Commander of Air Group), the VF-1S also sometimes finds itself serving as the variable fighter for a squadron leader much like the VF-1J. Captain http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker] piloted a VF-1S during his command of the infamous Skull Squadron.

<description>The ARMD Class vessels were designed as space carriers for variable fighters and other U.N.S. spacecraft. The ARMD began construction in April 2003 at the Lagrange Point 5 manufacturing station. The first two carriers ARMD-01 and ARMD-02 were commissioned in July 2008 and October 2008 respectively and were opertaional prior to Space War I in February 2009. Built by OTEC Company, the ARMD carriers featured OverTechnology with gravity control systems, a reaction heat pile system and even the fold drive (though this super dimension navigation system was never implemented). At 430 meters in length, the ARMD carriers were much smaller than the large http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] and both ARMD-01 and ARMD-02 were originally meant to dock with the larger craft when the ship achieved orbit during its maiden voyage.
As a carrier vessel, the ARMDs held numerous ships and mecha. ARMD-01 held 78 SF-A3 Lancer II space fighters and 270 QF-3000E Ghost fighters (as well as an unknown number of VF-1A variable fighters) just prior to Space War I. In addition to several hundred fighters, the ARMD carrier was armed with many weapons including beam cannons, small anti-aircraft cannons and launchers as well as large anti-ship reaction warheads. The ARMD possessed many large vernier thruster nozzles positioned all over the craft. These powerful thrusters granted the ARMD excellent maneuverability in space and also proved very useful for combat engagement and evasion.Both ARMD-01 and ARMD-02 were destroyed in the first battle of Space War I on February 7, 2009. However, both vessels engaged in combat with the Zentradi fleet and proved quite successful in destroying several large Zentradi capital warships with their anti-ship reaction warheads. Eventually, six more vessels of the ARMD Class were commissioned and both the original ships were replaced. To this day, ARMD-01 and ARMD-02 remain docked with the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] on Earth.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/armd.htm</description>

<name>Regult</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>Simple, efficient and reliable, the Esbeliben Regult is the standard mass production mecha of the Zentradi Army. Produced in staggering numbers to fill the need for an all-purpose mecha, this battle pod accommodates a single Zentradi soldier in a compact cockpit and is capable of operating in space or on a planet`s surface. In space, the Regult makes use of two booster engines and numerous vernier thrusters to propel itself at very high speeds, capable of engaging and maintaining pace with the UN Spacy`s VF-1 variable fighter. Within an atmosphere, the Regult is largely limited to ground combat but retains high speed and maneuverability. Armed with a variety of direct-fire energy weapons and anti-personnel/anti-aircraft guns, the Regult is capable of engaging both air and ground units. The Regult is also capable of high, thruster-assisted leaping that allows the pod to cover long distances and engage low flying aircraft. On land, the Regult is surprisingly fast, capable of closing with the VF-1 variable fighter in GERWALK flight (though likely unable to maintain pace at full GERWALK velocity).
The Regult saw much use during Space War I in repeated engagements against the forces of the UN Spacy, but its lack of versatility against superior mecha often resulted in average effectiveness. Several variants were seen in the war, typically with additional equipment to mount missile launchers or modified with electronic warfare equipment for ECM and reconnaissance roles. Possessing minimal defensive features, the Regult is a simple weapon that performs best in large numbers and when supported by other mecha such as Fighter Pods.

<name>HWR-00-Mk.II Monster</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>An immense mecha, the Heavy Weight Robot (HWR) Monster Mk II is a heavily armed "land battleship" with a name matching the great size of the destroid. Very shortly after the initial research into the destroids began in 2000 the HWR-00 series began development in December that year. After a lengthy design phase trial production began in October 2005 and the HWR-00 Monster first rollout was in September 2008. The Monster is the largest mobile ground weapon to ever be fielded in battle by mankind, over 41 meters long and weighing almost 300 tons. The Monster was envisioned as a trackless, self-propelled heavy weapon system to be utilized for attack and point defense. In actuality, the Monster`s massive size, poor maneuverability and dedicated long-range weaponry saw the mecha used as a semi-mobile artillery unit best utilized while avoiding uneven ground and any close-range engagement. When put to best use with supporting units in a combined arms role, the Monster is able to field incredible firepower equal to strategic bombing.
The Monster was originally designed to use 50cm linear cannons, but was scaled down with smaller guns when problems arose with system strength and insufficient power for continuous firing. Armed with four 40cm cannons, the Monster can fire a variety of munitions with the primary guns, including anti-armor shells, anti-aircraft munitions, howitzers and even nuclear reaction warheads (OverTechnology reaction warheads have an explosive yield rated at 0.1 kilotons to 50 kilotons). In addition to the main guns, the Mk II features a pair of 3-barreled missile launchers not originally included in the design but incorporated into the two arm units. To compensate for the Monster`s vulnerabilities such as the intense heat emissions of the unit (which prevented effective use of counter measures such as chaff or smoke), the armor was designed to be extremely thick and even capable of withstanding a near hit from a reaction weapon.
Though mass-produced like the other destroids, only two Monster Mk II units were onboard the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] during the outbreak of Space War I. During the conflict, the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] onboard factories made use of equipment for several more Monster mecha and produced a third unit to accompany the original two. Most of the other Monster units were destroyed by orbital bombardment from the Zentradi fleet. The few Monster Mk II units aboard the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] distinguished themselves as very capable war machines during Space War I. While most destroid units suffered heavy losses, the Monsters aboard the ship remained in active service for most of the war and the capability to launch reaction warheads was put to use during the battle with the http://anidb.net/ch17601 [Boddole Zer] Main Fleet in February 2010.

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>The first of the MBR-04 series Destroids, the Tomahawk Mk I entered service in February 2007. Conceived as a non-variable combat robot designed to counter giant-sized infantry, the Tomahawk was built using OverTechnology taken researched from the crash of the alien space craft known as the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] in 1999. Once successfully tested, the Tomahawk became the basis for three other Destroid types and the improved Tomahawk Mk VI quickly followed in late 2007.
The Tomahawk Mk VI is the most heavily armed Destroid of the MBR-04 series and the most widely deployed model. Of the nearly 600 hundred Destroids aboard the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] in February 2009, over 500 were Tomahawk Mk VI units. Armed with a wide array of weaponry suited to nearly any combat operation, the Tomahawk features particle cannons, missiles, machine guns, lasers and flamethrowers to unleash fire in any role from anti-personnel to anti-aircraft. The Mk VI version also features a retractable periscope and includes the option of mounting searchlight/missile packs in one or both mounts on either side of the top weapons bays.

<name>Queadluun-Rau</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>The largest and arguably most devastating Zentradi mecha of Space War I, the Queadluun-Rau battle suits of the female division forces are fast, maneuverable and well-armed mecha. Like the Nousjadeul-Ger of the Zentradi male division forces, the Queadluun-Rau is a powered suit of armor featuring two reaction furnaces that power massive dual engines, propelling the suit at tremendous speeds. A special inertia vector control system gives the Queadluun-Rau unparalled maneuverability and allows efficient atmospheric flight using only vernier thrusters, effectively compensating for the suit`s lack of aerodynamic lift. In battle, the female powered suit relies upon a deadly array of rapid-fire laser and particle cannons, but most lethal of all are the missile launchers. Armed with over a hundred individual short-range missiles, the Queadluun-Rau is capable of engaging dozens of targets, inflicting heavy damage with torrents of guided missile fire.
Most famous of all Queadluun-Rau units in Space War I was the personal mecha of Zentradi ace pilot http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia Fallyna]. Her incredible skills were legendary; http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] was undefeated in her military career up until Space War I. Such was her prowess that her reputation was known even among the Zentradi male divisions, a point of contention for http://anidb.net/ch10516 [Quamzin Kravshera]. Infuriated by http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Millia]`s harsh criticisms of his failures in battle against the forces of the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross], http://anidb.net/ch10516 [Quamzin] cunningly goaded http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] into battle against http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Maximilian Jenius], the ace Valkyrie pilot of the UN Spacy. In her Queadluun-Rau, http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia] sought the enemy ace eagerly, but was soundly defeated in battle by http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Jenius] in his http://anidb.net/ch48787 [VF-1A Valkyrie] and barely escaped with her life. It is also notable that another Queadluun-Rau unit was responsible for the attack upon Major http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker]`s http://anidb.net/ch48790 [VF-1S Valkyrie] fighter, the incident which ultimately proved fatal for the veteran ace pilot. Capable of deployment in any environment, the Queadluun-Rau could engage enemy forces in space, in the atmosphere or on the ground. Despite a lack of emphasis upon long-range weaponry, the Queadluun-Rau exceled at medium-to-close range combat and was one of the most versatile and successful Zentradi mecha.
Following the Great Interstellar War (Space War I), the Queadluun-Rau units were employed by the U.N. Forces. Unfortunately, breakdowns in production at the Factory Satellite caused a gradual decrease in operational units. Operational rates were reduced such that by the 2030s the Queadluun-Rau could not be supported by available spare parts. Fortunately, support for reproduction of the Queadluun-Rau remained strong. In 2035, variable fighter design and manufacturing company General Galaxy was entrusted by the U.N. Forces with a modernization and reproduction plan for the Queadluun-Rau.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/queadluun-rau.htm</description>

<charactertype id="4">Vessel</charactertype>
<description>A potent warship, the Quiltra-Quelamitz class vessel is an often forgotten but significant part of the Zentradi fleets. Though the craft is somewhat small by the standards of most Zentradi ships of the line, it possesses one of the most devastating weapons of the fleet. The forward half of the craft is dominated by the main gun, a heavy converging energy beam cannon. The bow splits in half vertically, collimating the energy of the blast just prior to release. The main gun can blast through the most heavily armored hypercarbon hulls of enemy spacecraft and can rain high-energy mass destruction down upon a planetary body. With it`s powerful primary weapon, the Quiltra-Quelamitz is the backbone of any large-scale fleet-to-fleet engagement and a necessary tool for operations requiring effective planetary bombardment. Though primarily an anti-ship/anti-fortifications vessel, the Quiltra-Quelamitz does feature many conventional cannon emplacements upon its hull and carries a modest complement of Nousjadeul-Ger powered armor suits for anti-mecha attack and defense.Aside from its role in the destruction of planet Earth on February 2010, the most notable operation involving a Quiltra-Quelamitz class ship was during the Defensive Battle of Macross City in January 2012. Zentradi warlord http://anidb.net/ch10516 [Quamzin Kravshera] commanded a Quiltra-Quelamitz in his failed attempt to destroy the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross]. During the battle, the main cannon of the Quiltra-Quelamitz inflicted fatal damage on the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] with a single shot, penetrating the hull and destroying the ship`s main reactors. Though the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] was able to briefly return fire via auxiliary power, the Quiltra-Quelamitz was able to remain aloft after a direct hit from the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] super-dimension-energy cannon. The Quiltra-Quelamitz then rammed the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] in a suicide run, but only succeeded in severing the starboard arm and docked http://anidb.net/ch48825 [SLV-111 Daedalus] carrier from the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1] before crashing to the ground just beyond the shore of Lake Macross.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/quiltra-quelamitz.htm</description>

<description>The largest "ship class" vessel of the Zentradi forces, the Gol Boddole Zer-Class Mobile Fortress served as the mothership for the Zentradi for 120,000 cycles and in Space War I. Decorated in the familiar green hull of the Zentradi forces, the sprawling Gol Boddole Zer mobile fortress appears almost organic in design, resembling vegetation. At some 600 kilometers in width, the vessel was bristling with weapons and functioned as a mobile port for the Zentradi ships of the line. Most impressive of all, the Gol Boddole Zer mobile fortress featured a powerful main beam gun located in large globe at the bow of the ship. When fired, the beam gun produced a broad beam of energy that could destroy thousands of smaller warships or even a vessel as large as itself with but a single shot. Though the gun could only be fired once (due to damage over the many years of interstellar warfare), Zentradi leader Gol Boddole Zer utilized it to destroy the Meltrandi mobile fortress in the final battle of Space War I. However, http://anidb.net/ch49057 [Boddole Zer]`s victory was achieved only at the cost of destroying thousands of his ships in the line of fire, a decision that ultimately brought about his own demise.

<description>The VF-4 Lightning III began development in 2005 under the initial designation of the VF-X-4. Developed as a successor craft to the VF-1 Valkyrie, the VF-4 Lightning III was designed as a variable fighter that emphasized mobility in outer space. As a result of including existing Overtechnology and introducing Zentradi-series technology, the V-4 has a characteristic three-hulled-type airframe structure remarkably different from the VF-1 Valkyire design. The three-hulled style of the VF-4 increased fuselage volume, propellant capacity and armament load capability that all resulted in a 40% improved combat ability over the VF-1 Valkyrie. The VF-4 did suffer minor mobility problems within an atmosphere and it was deployed to the Space Air corps of emigrant fleets to serve as the main fighter craft of the UN Forces in the 2020s. It was because flight performance within the atmosphere was not as good as the VF-1 that the VF-5000 Star Mirage became the main combat craft within atmosphere while the VF-4 operated mainly in outer space. The VF-4`s development began with the prototype VF-X-4 and the VF-X-3. However, when Earth was devastated in Space War I the loss of military facilities also resulted in loss of the VF-X-3. Amongst the airframes under development exist prototype No. 1 craft, VF-X-4V1 and the trial manufactured VF-4A-0 and thus the surviving VF-X-4 was developed and completed as the VF-4 Lightning III. VF-X-4 underwent flight tests, including being test piloted by Space War I veteran http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru]. Once successful operational models were ready, the VF-4 began mass production on February 2012. Initial deployment began on the http://anidb.net/ch49113 [SDF-2 Megaroad-01] in VF-1 Skull and SVF-184 Iron Chiefs Squadrons on September 2012. When the SDF-2 Megaroad launched in the same month, http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru] flew a VF-4 along side the new colonization vessel as the ship lifted from Earth and began exploration outside of the Sol system.
Built as a space fighter, the VF-4 primary weapons became two large beam cannons, though the craft is capable of carrying a GU-11 gun pod in GERWALK and Battroid modes. In addition to the powerful primary beam guns, the Lightning III also featured twelve semi-recessed long-range missiles as well as underwing pylons for additional missiles. The VF-4 was only slightly heavier than the VF-1, but featured considerably more powerful engines making the craft ideal for operations deeper out in space. The Lightning III was also much faster in the atmosphere than the older VF-1 though the VF-4 flight mobility performance was not as great. The VF-4 is also notable as the first production variable fighter to utilize a HOTAS system (Hands On Throttle And Stick) for the cockpit HMI (Human-Machine Interface). The VF-4`s cockpit was also built as a single hexagonal MFD (Multi-Function Display) that proved so successful it was retrofitted into "Block 6" VF-1 fighters as well as providing the template for all future variable fighter cockpits. Fully transformable, the VF-4 could shift into Battroid and GERWALK modes like previous variable fighters.
By the end of 2015, mass production of the VF-1 series at last came to an end. From 2020 onward, the VF-4 Lightning III officially replaced the VF-1 to become the main variable fighter of U.N. Forces. A trial-produced variable fighter, designated the VF-4A-0, was also built using 25% VF-1 Valkyrie parts. Production of the VF-4 continued for a decade and ceased in 2022 with a total of 8,245 Lightning III variable fighters produced. The VF-4 variable fighter remained in active service into the late 2040`s but was complemented or substituted in many branches of the UN Forces by the cheaper and more atmospherically maneuverable VF-5000 Star Mirage. The VF-4 Lightning III was eventually replaced as the main variable fighter of U.N. Spacy in the later half of the 2030s by the http://anidb.net/ch48620 [VF-11 Thunderbolt].

<description>The Megaroad-01 Class vessel was originally under construction as the SDF-2 Macross Class warship. Construction of the SDF-2 on the Apollo Lunar Base halted late in Space War I and once the war had ended, the New U.N. Government required colonization ships more than warships. When construction resumed in June 2010, the SDF-2 was renamed Megaroad-01 after the Humanity Seeding Project was implemented. Utilizing only the engine block and command control block of the warship, most of the Megaroad does not retain the original look and was newly designed with only minimum armaments and a hull that was not of a strength suitable for battle. At over 1,700 meters in length, the massive Megaroad Class ships were the first mass-produced vessels designed for super-long-distance colonization as part of the Humanity Seeding Project. The Megaroad was designed as the mothership of a large-scale space emigration with emphasis on long-term navigation and living environment capability (effectively utilizing knowledge acquired from operation of the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] Class). The ship`s primary mission is to protect the seeds of humanity through colonization and although the 25,000 complement of the Megaroad is much smaller than the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1] population, prepared supplies for long-term habitation and the residential facilities were both dramatically improved. The first ship Megaroad-01 was launched on September 2012 and two more super-long-distance colonization ships designated Megaroad-02 and Megaroad-03 (based on the Megaroad-01 design) began construction that same month. Thereafter, the UNG would construct one or two super-long-distance colonization ships every year and these colonization fleets would be routinely launched to build settlements on habitable planets throughout the galaxy.
With the Megaroad-01 as flagship, the Super Long Range Emigration Fleet Number One launched on September 2012 with some 25,000 (80,000) colonists aboard the flagship and an escort of Zentradi battlecruisers and U.N. Spacy battleships. The ship was commanded by Major http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Ichijou Misa] and her husband http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru] commanded the http://anidb.net/ch49112 [VF-4 Lightining III] variable fighter squadrons assigned to the Megaroad-01. Along with war hero and idol singer http://anidb.net/ch7418 [Lynn Minmay], the Megaroad-01 departed the Sol System. Sadly, contact with the Megaroad-01 ended four years later in 2016. Although the Super Long Range Emigration Fleet Number One was officially declared lost, the New United Nations Government was nervous about any ill-will directed towards the Seeding Project as a result of the loss. Thus, the New U.N. Government avoided making the Megaroad-01 incident public and instead stated the Megaroad-01 was still continuing on its way. The fate of http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Misa], http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru], http://anidb.net/ch7418 [Minmay] and the crew and colonists of the Megaroad-01 remains a mystery to this day.
