<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="427214">Even better than the first series which was one of those animes which have awesome action and most emotionally appealing tones at the same time. Watch it and recommend it to everyone.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="133106">The story is so nice. It ends perfectly! Nice pic and voice acting.

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="362792">This is truly, one of the best animes, if not [b]the[/b] best. 
This is a [u]must-watch-anime[/u], and deserves rating above 9 in any case, and my personal rating for this would be 10, if it wasn`t for that one, single, little, filler that was in one ep. :thumbup:</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="246307">RECOMMEND IT! Great like the first one still rate the first one a bit higher but &amp;lt;spoiler/&amp;gt; Their father`s story blew me away&amp;lt;spoiler/&amp;gt;</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="167349">When I watched about 10 episode, I thought the story was pretty similar with the first one so I gave up continue watching. However, for some reason I decided to continue watching this anime because I had no more good anime to watch. And to my GREAT surprise, this anime turned out to be totally different with the first one. And the story was MUCH MORE exciting and better than the previous one. I am now totally addicted and in love with Brotherhood ^o^</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="130348">Very well made</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="464550">one of the best series around in this age.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="281309">A must see for all the obvious reasons .. also i must add that it is one of the best animes ever created for this type of category</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="291449">This is a great example of a shônen with a good story and great characters to match. And when the story is done, it is *done*, without dragging on the series aimlessly.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="299976">One of the best series I`ve ever seen... It has everything you can ask for. The way the story is told is way better than in the previous FMA and you`ll be pretty satisfied with it! Definitely watch it at any cost!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="426906">Best action/fantasy shounen ever, just watch it!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="391848">While the original Fullmetal Alchemist was awesome, this is near perfection. Masterful story telling and impressive in-depth character development combined with consistently high quality visuals and solid audio. Totally recommended for any anime fan.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="259505">This anime is GREAT in nearly every aspect possible! And if you put it in contrast with the "original" FMA series, you`ll see that this remake lacks ALL of the silly and absolutely nonsensical character development and overall plot mistakes that series made.

This one is clearly designed to be a masterpiece, and it accomplishes its goal. Must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="461982">Best anime ever!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="421413">I just love every bit of it. This is one of those you can watch all over again and again and never get bored. It proudly stands above all alongside with GITS and EVA.

*MUST SEE FOR ALL*</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="301941">This thing isn`t legit, it`s beyond animes. FMA was good but the brotherhood is so good that it makes FMA become a disgrace to life. Watch this.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="209272">Simply the best anime I have ever watched.
Makes me wonder why isnt there any awards,yet?</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="507844">Triumph of the animated motion pictures. Peak of the human brain and consciousness. Milestone in anime world. Watch this if you have a slightest curiosity or an enthusiasm to broaden your horizon. I promise it`ll be one humongous exploration and an unique experience.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="276083">Ah.. If only all anime based on manga actually followed the manga as close as this series did. One of the best anime series ever made imo. I actually bought the blu-ray.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="437523">Effortless execution is the only phrase to describe the series.  The comedy, the action, the story, the characters and their growth (literally and metaphorically) are all done extremely well.  I can not recommend this show enough.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="391785">The best animé ever. It will never cease to amaze you. You will just stare and wonder helplessly while fullmetal alchemist brotherhood bombards you with splendour.&lt;br /&gt;You will never predict how mesmerizing this story will be.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="543072">It is very rare to find a series that is so genuine in its portrayal of humanity and relationships.  This is a series that weaves together a heavy plot with a large cast of fantastic characters and does it without seeming like its trying too hard.  Joy and sorrow are perfectly portrayed, evoking emotions in the audience without making it seem forced or contrived.  We feel something profound for each of these characters, a feat that is often hard to pull off effectively in a series.  Showcasing brilliant animation, a great score, wonderful direction and voice acting, and boasting a compelling cast of memorable characters, FMA:B is an amazing anime.  This was a classic the moment it aired and is a definite must-see for all anime fans.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="508247">Its simple .In my humble , subjective and limited opinion , this is the best anime to be ever created , it is perfect in all sides .Even though one piece is my favourite anime , this is the best and most perfect one , you arent an anime fan if you havent watched this.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="462759">awesome!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="575638">By far one of the best animes I`ve ever watched. It really delves into the basics of human needs/instincts. I can`t believe I`m years late on watching this amazing series.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="611680">sughoii desu!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="240625">No words can describe how awesome and well executed this anime is!! Everything about this anime is just purely a masterpiece!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="545305">A true masterpiece! much better than the original in many aspects. A must see for anyone.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="554678">This is an anime that can both tug at your heart strings and lead you down the rabbit hole of considering the value of human life in the universe. A must see for any anime fan.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="52094">Personal favorite.
This is what I always recommend to people that don`t like anime just because it is so good that is breaks out of just being an anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="283829">Gripping story through every single episode, multidimensional characters and beautiful animation make FMAB one of the best anime of all time.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="225406">All-time best.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="17171">I was fan of the first one that came out, and as "good" as i`d say it was... this puts it to utter shame. not only that, after watching this i understand why so many manga readers of FMA were upset over the first one. this is definitely one of, if not THE, best animes i`ve ever seen... and i`ve seen a decent amount. awesome characters, great music... and takes you through all the emotions you could ask it to.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="764835">This is one of the best anime`s ever released, and it`s one of the standards I use to measure other series.

A perfect 10/10 for me everyone should watch this at least once in their lifetime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="361111">Masterpiece!
Must see!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="815148">Simply put, one of the all-time greatest modern anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="302824">The First and Most likely the last anime i will ever rate 10 stars</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="354280">Faithful to the manga, this adaptation has an intriguing plot and remarkably human characters.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="316585">Just The Best!!!Don`t miss it!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="201805">one of the best anime stories ever made. great animation really must see</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="397388">The first one was already one of the better anime out there. But brotherhood just surpasses it with bounds and leaps. If you have seen the first one, this is a must see, the story is deeper, the characters are worked out well, and the action is much higher.
If you haven`t seen FMA, than it`s time to start. One of the best action anime !</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="142767">this is the best anime you will ever see for real and if you saw the first FMA it will be even more enjoyable</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="322994">You Won`t Find Anything like This Anywere........</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="422403">Although I usually wish people could refrain from stating that an anime is the "best", I do want to state that this anime has surpassed many of my favorites. There`s plenty of everything in this anime, there`s some magic elements, some mech (if I dare to say it), character development, psychological mindtrips, and so forth.

This is an anime I would certainly recommend to someone who has yet to watch an anime and needs a good impression of the genre.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="466955">This one is faaaarrr better than the original, and why? Because...1: Better animation. 2: More focus on the plot. 3: No filler and 4: The action is dramatic. There`s fun moments, serious moments and sad moments. It keeps getting more better after one episode and a another.
To sum it up: One of Bones´ best ones yet.
It`s a must see!
Age recommedation: 13-17 because of strong violence.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="84121">Great Series</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="20063">Good work. The story of this anime is one of the best out there.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="425804">The Best Anime I ever watched on my life, the first show is the one who opened the Anime world to me and I never watched a better show until I`ve seen this. I really recommend it to everyone. It has a balance between everything Awesome story, good action, drama, comedy and some romance.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="215656">epic masterpiece, must see !</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="353812">I was told that the new FMA would be great, but it really exceeded my expectations, truly a great anime, recommended to anyone. Also, Mustang is awesome!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="92752">One of the best I have seen. Don`t miss it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="424734">this one is so good i even recommend it for shonen haters although its tagged as one cause it doesnt feel like one of those stereotypical shonen at all</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="174426">I have enjoyed the first FMA and always considered it to be a top-notch anime, but this one is on a different level. It has everything one may need, over the top action, a bit of drama here and there, well established characters, and a few inches of comedy for those who like to crack up a face and smile from time to time. It is really THE anime of the moment, and a must see for everyone.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="158977">Best of `09!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="382948">Thumps Up! Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an epic tale being told property! Characters, Story, Atmosphere, music, direction are combined together to give you this epic result, that just raised the bar.
Flawless? I must say Yes. A must see even if you have seen the first series.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="432374">The best anime I`ve seen in years!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="31431">First one was awesome. This one is beyond awesome.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="318940">What can I say. I`m stunned! Never thought it would be that brilliant.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="426448">the best anime ever according to me,even death note was lame compared to this.a must see for every anime fan. and for  the people who thought the first fma was good, fma brotherhood (the original fma anime based on the manga) is a million times better than the previous version.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="201013">This anime cannot be described in words. You must experience it yourself in order to get the full grasp of its awesomeness!!! Definitely a perfect 10 in my book and will be and ALWAYS will be one of my favorite anime of all time.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="257215">A series that keeps getting better episode after episode. I haven`t really seen a series that keeps you that involved through out. Stays 100% true to the Manga as well.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="566906">This anime.. is just perfection.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="111106">Overall, an excellent series. However, I recommend watching the original first to compliment this one.</recommendation>

<description>Two brothers lose http://anidb.net/ch7784 [their mother] to an incurable disease. With the power of alchemy, they use taboo knowledge to resurrect her. The process fails, and as a toll for using this type of alchemy, the older brother, http://anidb.net/ch5885 [Edward Elric], loses his left leg while the younger brother, http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse Elric], loses his entire body. To save his brother, Edward sacrifices his right arm and is able to affix his brother`s soul to a suit of armor. With the help of http://anidb.net/ch10164 [a family friend], Edward receives metal limbs - automail - to replace his lost ones. With that, Edward vows to search for the Philosopher`s Stone to return the brothers to their original bodies, even if it means becoming a State Alchemist, one who uses their alchemy for the military.

<name>immortality</name>
<description>Immortality is the ability to live in a physical or spiritual form for an infinite or inconceivably vast length of time. Humans, whose life span is limited and who die of age, disease and external trauma, have long sought ways to extend their lives; the Epic of Gilgamesh, considered one of the first great literary works created by mankind, is primarily the quest of a hero seeking to become immortal. The advances of science, in particular medicine and engineering, and especially in the last few centuries, have helped people extend their life span and may yet continue finding ways to do so.
In fiction, immortals are not quite as uncommon as in real life, and the possible implications of endless or very long lives are often explored. Such implications include, but are not limited to: repeatedly accompanying the deaths of those dear to them; having to hide their condition from the mortals surrounding them; becoming disillusioned with their lives and being unable to kill themselves; and even staying forever trapped in the body of a specific physical age, that body most often being that of a child. As such, while many may wish for immortality, it may be little more than a curse for the few who have it.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<name>magic circles</name>
<description>A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised.
Traditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for non-magical work such as meditation.
Generally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names.

Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>steampunk</name>
<description>Steampunk is a sub-genre of science fiction that typically features steam-powered machinery, especially in a setting inspired by industrialized Western civilization during the 19th century. Steampunk works are often set in an alternative history of the 19th century`s British Victorian era or American "Wild West", in a post-apocalyptic future during which steam power has regained mainstream use, or in a fantasy world that similarly employs steam power.
Noteworthy attributes of the theme include large amounts smoke pollution from wood or coal burning, the affinity to metal constructs like cogs and metal tubing, and the mechanization of everyday objects.
Steampunk perhaps most recognisably features anachronistic technologies or retro-futuristic inventions as people in the 19th century might have envisioned them, and is likewise rooted in the era`s perspective on fashion, culture, architectural style, and art.
Such technology may include fictional machines like those found in the works of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, or the modern authors Philip Pullman, Scott Westerfeld, Stephen Hunt and China Miéville. Other examples of steampunk contain alternative history-style presentations of such technology as lighter-than-air airships, analog computers, or such digital mechanical computers as Charles Babbage`s Analytical Engine.
Steampunk can also exemplify everything that is bad about unrestrained technological progress (dead matter), when compared to life and nature. The anime usually makes a point to propound the latter.

Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies.

The fate of such characters is normally not for the faint of heart, and the audience is expected to at least sympathise with the poor character`s fate, and at times even be horrified at the shocking turn of events that led to their demise.</description>

<name>rebellion</name>
<description>Rebellion, uprising, or insurrection is a refusal of obedience or order. It may, therefore, be seen as encompassing a range of behaviors aimed at destroying or taking over the position of an established authority such as a government, governor, president, political leader, financial institution, or person in charge. On the one hand the forms of behaviour can include non-violent methods such as the (overlapping but not quite identical) phenomena of civil disobedience, civil resistance and nonviolent resistance. On the other hand it may encompass violent campaigns. Those who participate in rebellions, especially if they are armed rebellions, are known as "rebels".&#13;

<name>seven deadly sins</name>
<description>The seven deadly sins, also known as the capital vices or cardinal sins, is a grouping and classification of vices of Christian origin. Behaviors or habits are classified under this category if they directly give birth to other immoralities. According to the standard list, they are pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, and sloth, which are also contrary to the seven virtues. These sins are often thought to be abuses or excessive versions of one`s natural faculties or passions (for example, gluttony abuses one`s desire to eat).

<name>manly tears</name>
<description>Somewhere down the line, it became the "norm" that boys don`t cry. The scenario does not matter; shedding tears is the ultimate no-no in terms of what you can and cannot do as a man (at least in the West, anyway). But there comes a time when a man`s emotions do get the better of him, and they pour forth - as prerequisite an impassioned speech may or may not be present - by cascading down his cheeks. These are what we like to call "manly tears". Extremely powerful. Not limited but often used in hot-blooded / super robot shows. Examples include Yuusha Ou GaoGaiGar, Getter Robo and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.
The opposite of manly tears are "girly tears".</description>

<name>Alex Louis Armstrong</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Alex Louis Armstrong, the "Strong Arm Alchemist," is a large and comically emotional State Alchemist who will burst into tears or joyous praise, given the right situation, and embraces others in an effort to console them. Because he is an extremely strong character, this usually causes great personal injury to others. Armstrong is very proud of his strength and of his muscular physique, frequently taking off his shirt so that he can flex for the benefit of others. As a final element of his comedic properties, he has the tendency to "sparkle"; when first appearing in a scene or taking off his shirt, pink stars radiate from his body. Despite his humorous tendencies, Armstrong can be very serious when the situation calls for it. He is not fond of violence and will try to end conflicts peacefully, and will break down and cry if an innocent person is killed.
Armstrong comes from a wealthy family of aristocrats who have earned renown in most professions. He has mastered many of his family`s talents for himself, and when displaying such a talent, he remarks it to have been "passed down the Armstrong line for generations." His alchemical skills also represent a remnant of his family`s history; by using a unique kind of brass knuckles, Armstrong can reshape any solid object that he punches. Armstrong is a valuable ally of http://anidb.net/ch6586 [Roy Mustang] and the Elric brothers, even if they are not always happy to be in his emotional company. He takes his honor as a soldier and as a leader seriously, and always looks out for his peers` and subordinates` best interests.

Despite his over-the-top comical tendencies, Hughes is a valuable ally to Mustang`s goal of becoming Führer, supplying whatever classified intelligence that may be beneficial. He has also been shown to be a capable fighter, skilled with throwing knives. His general understanding of others` emotions and desire to help them similarly gains the affection of the Elric brothers and their friend http://anidb.net/ch6588 [Winry Rockbell], as he always offers advice or hospitality to them when they need it.

<description>Envy is a genderless (though is referred to as `he` as well as `it`) homunculus who has the ability of shape-shifting. It uses this power to assume the form of any person and even copy their voice.
Envy is most comfortable in the "adorable" and "beautiful" form of an androgynous teenager. It usually serves as a spy, but abilities are also extremely useful for assassinations, as demonstrated by the murder of http://anidb.net/ch6590 [Maes Hughes]. Envy`s most frequently used assassination technique is to impersonate someone whom the target loved or cared about, and use the target`s hesitation as an opportunity to kill him or her. Envy may not be as smart as some of the other Homunculi, but is by no means an idiot. In fact, it can be just as good a puppet master as http://anidb.net/ch6591 [Lust]. But this is overshadowed by its cockiness and bad temper. Its temper can easily be set off by insulting his large and delicate ego, causing it to make mistakes.</description>

He is later found by the Elric brothers, and he directs them to some of the research he left behind in Central to help them in their search for the Philosopher`s Stone.
Marcoh is then captured by the homunculi, and is kept locked up deep below Central. While there, he is found by http://anidb.net/ch6593 [Scar]. Seeing Scar as a means to an end, he tells Scar of his involvement in the Ishbalan War in the hopes of being killed in vengeance. Scar instead disfigures Marcoh`s face beyond recognition as a disguise, kidnaps him, and forces him to help in bringing down the homunculi.
After Father`s defeat, Marcoh offers to restore Mustang`s eyesight in return of allowing the surviving Ishbalans to return to their homeland with him placed there as a doctor.
In the first anime, he is soon afterward taken into military custody, only to be killed by the homunculus http://anidb.net/ch5909 [Gluttony].

<description>Sheska is a mousy, bespectacled young woman who had previously worked in the National Central Library in Central City, but was fired for spending her time reading books instead of doing her job. http://anidb.net/ch5885 [Edward] and http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse] Elric seek her out to discover whether or not http://anidb.net/ch10165 [Tim Marcoh]`s research journal had been located in the library`s First Branch, which had been burnt down. After finding her trapped in her home under a collapsed mountain of books, Sheska confirms the Elrics` worst fears - that the book, which she herself had read cover to cover, had indeed been in the First Branch and, therefore, destroyed.
But, as they leave, visibly disheartened, Sheska reveals that she has a photographic memory and can recreate the book for them, exactly as it had looked when she read it. As a result, Sheska is able to recreate Marcoh`s notes in five days to such a degree of detail that, even though Marcoh wrote them in code, Edward is able to decipher their hidden truth.
When http://anidb.net/ch6590 [Maes Hughes] reveals that several court-martial records had been kept in the First Branch, Edward and Alphonse recommend Sheska for the task of recreating them, as she had read them as well. Thanks to this, Sheska is hired into the Amestrian military at a desk job in the records department.</description>

A former serial killer, he became a human test subject in the military`s alchemical experiments and, in lieu of execution, had his disembodied soul bound to a suit of armor, similar to http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse Elric]. As a result of the schism between the storylines of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga and the 2003 anime series, Barry the Chopper appears in both but is a rather different character in each.</description>

On the day they were supposed to be executed, they instead became victims of the the fifth laboratory`s horrid human experiments involving the removal of souls from the bodies of nearby Central Prison`s death row inmates. They had their souls bound to a single suit of armor by way of a pair of blood runes (one in the helm and one in the armor`s neckpiece) and were assigned to kill any intruders at the laboratory. Prior to their official "execution" about two years before the start of the series, they were known about the country of Amestris as the infamous serial killer "Slicer" who, when finally captured, was discovered to have been a pair of murdering brothers.</description>

<description>Yoki is, when first introduced, a corrupt member of the military who imposes heavy taxes on the town of Youswell, bankrupting its citizens. When the Elric brothers arrive in town, they trick Yoki into giving up ownership of the town and promptly report his actions to the military. He is stripped of his rank and lives as a homeless person on the outskirts of Central, where he meets the fugitive http://anidb.net/ch6593 [Scar].
In the 2003 anime, Yoki alerts the military to Scar`s location, and in the subsequent raid to apprehend Scar he is killed by http://anidb.net/ch6591 [Lust].
In the manga, Yoki is forced to work for Scar under the threat of death. Though he tries to convince those they encounter that Scar is his servant, Yoki does as Scar commands and calls him "master". Since he has started following Scar around the country, Yoki has assumed a role as comic relief, often having pain inflicted upon him when he tries to seem superior to others. In Chapter 93, Yoki manages to hit Pride with http://anidb.net/ch14594 [Kimblee]`s car buying http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse] and http://anidb.net/ch16466 [Heinkel] some much needed time to escape. His reason for doing this was because everyone else "gets all the cool parts".</description>

<description>Izumi Curtis is a skilled martial artist and alchemist living in the southern Amestrian town of Dublith where - with her husband http://anidb.net/ch10173 [Sig Curtis] - she runs a butcher shop. Though she doesn`t usually take on students, Izumi accepted http://anidb.net/ch5885 [Edward] and http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse] Elric`s plea to accept them as her apprentices and instructed them in alchemical theory and practice for six months.
Although Izumi takes apparent pride in being a housewife and introduces herself as such to anyone who asks, her attractive and humble exterior belies a fearsome disposition such that Ed and Al become terrified at the mere thought of her.
She is prone to swift acts of violence and is often seen doling out physical harm, though most acts of overexertion on her part are followed by a regurgitation of blood linked to an internal injury from a failed Human Transmutation several years before. As a result of this, she is one of the few characters able to perform alchemy without the aid of a Transmutation Circle. Izumi is among the strongest women (and indeed characters) in the series.
She also appears to enjoy travel (a trait she may have passed on to Edward), as many of her appearances in the series find her journeying outside her hometown. She even announces herself as a "travelling housewife".</description>

He has also been shown to be able to sleep with his eyes wide open. Sig has mentioned that he blames himself for not realizing sooner that Izumi had been experimenting with Human Transmutation.</description>

Though his identity as a homunculus differs between the manga and first anime series (he is the homonculus Wrath in the manga and the 2009 anime adaptation, and Pride in the 2003 anime), his weapon of choice is the sword, which he wields with great proficiency. His deadly swordsmanship is further augmented by the "Ultimate Eye," a clairvoyant eye that bears the Ouroboros seal, which is usually covered by an eyepatch. The eye gives him the foresight to see all possible outcomes of a given situation, allowing him to predict the moves of any opponent before they happen, along with being able to see things the normal human eye can not, such as air currents. In both story lines, because homunculi cannot reproduce, Bradley is given a family to keep up appearances: his son, http://anidb.net/ch14960 [Selim Bradley], and a wife he personally chose.</description>

<description>In the manga, Sloth is not introduced until midway through the series, where he is revealed to be a muscular, but dim-witted giant standing almost twice the height of a normal man. Sloth`s Oroborus tattoo is located on his right shoulder blade and he is listed in Perfect Guide Book 2 to be the fifth Homunculus created by http://anidb.net/ch16464 [Father].
Sloth is tasked with digging a gigantic transmutation circle beneath Amestris to be used in turning the country into a Philosopher`s Stone. Though he is briefly impeded in this job when he runs into the Elric brothers at Briggs Fortress, he is allowed to continue his work, finishing the circle in chapter seventy-eight. Just as his name, Sloth is always wanting to rest and finish his job so he can stop working. When http://anidb.net/ch10174 [Greed] is captured by http://anidb.net/ch10175 [Wrath], he asks about Sloth and http://anidb.net/ch6591 [Lust] answers saying he is still working, meaning he was already making the tunnel before Greed left the group one hundred years before.
After finishing the transmutation tunnel, he acted as Father`s personal bodyguard, following him when he took direct control of the army and sleeping near Father`s throne when he has nothing else to do. In Chapter 91, he was sent to deal with http://anidb.net/ch13409 [Major General Olivier Armstrong] when she took one of the corrupted generals of Central as hostage, killing the hostage in a surprise attack.

Realizing his death forthcoming, he embraces his end with a smile, stating that merely living was too much effort for him, making Sloth the 4th Homunculus to die.</description>

Her subordinates are incredibly loyal to her, however, if their attachment to her were to ever put Briggs at any open risk, they are instructed to leave their leader behind. She despises http://anidb.net/ch6586 [Colonel Roy Mustang] and is brutal towards her little brother, considering them both to be weak and insulting to the state military. Perhaps her closest subordinate and friend is http://anidb.net/ch13411 [Major Miles], a man of mixed blood with great appreciation towards the General.
Olivier is first introduced when http://anidb.net/ch5885 [Edward] and http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse] are sent north with a letter of introduction from Alex to see his older sister. Once in the frigid, snowy plains of the Briggs Mountain range, they are attacked by http://anidb.net/ch13410 [Buccaneer] (believing them to be Drachman spies), and taken before the General herself. Olivier is quick to dismiss her brother`s letter and informs the two brothers that she only judges people with her own eyes.</description>

<description>Captain Buccaneer is an Amestrian State Military Officer stationed at Fort Briggs and a close subordinate of Major General http://anidb.net/ch13409 [Olivier Mira Armstrong]. Abrasive and suspicious, Buccaneer is often one to strike first and ask questions later, in fitting with the Briggs mindset of "Survival of the Fittest", and seems to enjoy violence and combat, often using vicious animal metaphors in his speech. He is loath to trust strangers and does not hold back in dealing out harsh treatment to people with whom he is unfamiliar. Despite this, Buccaneer is an incredibly brave and loyal soldier and shows his more jovial side to those whom he calls "comrade".</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Major Miles is an Amestrian State Military Officer stationed at Fort Briggs as Major General http://anidb.net/ch13409 [Olivier Mira Armstrong]`s personal adjutant. Dutiful and intelligent, Miles is among Armstrong`s most trusted soldiers and fulfills his orders efficiently and to the best of his ability. Though pragmatic and calculating, Miles is not without a heart; he holds a great deal of admiration for his queen, a soft spot in his heart for his comrades and the hope that people will be able to work together without prejudice in the near future.
Like most soldiers serving at Briggs, however, Miles hides a personal secret behind his slow-blindness goggles. Though he is the child of a multi-ethnic family, his paternal grandfather`s Ishvalan heritage runs strongest in him, resulting in Miles` distinctive red eyes despite being only one quarter Ishvalan.
In 1908, when http://anidb.net/ch10175 [Führer]`s Order 3066 called for the assembly and confinement of all Ishvalan people serving in the Amestrian military at the start of the Ishval Civil War`s final stage, Miles had just been assigned to Armstrong`s command at Briggs. However, she neither confined Miles nor sent him away to the government`s internment camps. When Miles, confused by Armstrong`s decision and angered by the slaughter of his ancestors, confronted Armstrong as to why she kept him as her assistant, she told him that prejudice on the battlefield would only lead to casualties and that, as a pure-blooded Amestrian, she valued the measured judgment and unique perspective of someone like Miles, who had not only Ishvalan blood, but the blood of several other ethnicities in his veins. Armstrong urged Miles to work as part of Briggs` singular force to ensure everyone`s survival and told him that, if he still felt resentment toward Amestrians for the murder of his grandfather and relatives, she would take him on in a one-on-one duel whenever he should so choose. After this exchange, Miles put aside his grievances aside and became committed to following Armstrong honorably and changing the general opinion of Ishvalans.</description>

<name>Elicia Hughes</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Elicia Hughes is the young daughter of Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes and his wife Gracia. The apple of the Lt. Colonel`s eye, Elicia and her apparently unfathomable adorableness are the subject of just about all Maes` casual conversation and grace her father`s presence in the form of a photograph that he carries everywhere and shows to almost everyone.
In the manga, Elicia first appears in Chapter 14, when Winry Rockbell visits Central City and is practically kidnapped to the young girl`s third birthday party by Maes. Fumbling precociously over her numbers and being genuinely enthusiastic, she manages to win over Winry as well, who begins to see the toddler as a baby sister.
When Maes dies, Elicia is both confused and devastated and demands sadly at the funeral that the strange men stop burying her papa so that he can return to loving her and his job. Though Elicia`s protests break the hearts of most of the present mourners (as well as fans of the series), it is revealed later that Wrath was merely trembling from the strong desire to quiet her by force.
She appears again in Chapter 36, when (after hearing about Maes` murder) Winry returns to the Hughes residence to speak with Gracia. Though a significant amount of time has passed, it is clear that little Elicia has not yet managed to comprehend the finality of her father`s death, as she responds to Winry`s knock at the door with an enthusiastic "Papa!" before somberly realizing her mistake.
Despite this, Elicia retains her innocence, greeting her surrogate older sister with love and comforting her mourning mother.
In the 2003 anime series, Elicia is introduced during the flashback to Edward`s preparation for the State Alchemy Examinations. In place of the character Satella Lecoulte from the manga, Gracia is the one introduced as pregnant in the first anime series. During a snowstorm in midwinter, Gracia goes into labor and while Maes goes to fetch the doctor, Ed, Alphonse and Nina Tucker must tend to Gracia and help deliver the baby, making the three of them present for Elicia`s birth, which just so happens to coincide with Edward`s birthday.</description>

<description>Solf J. Kimblee, the "Red Lotus Alchemist" (sometimes referred to as the "Crimson Alchemist") is a former State Alchemist and special agent working under the direct orders of http://anidb.net/ch10175 [Führer King Bradley]. Admittedly sadistic and arguably psychopathic, Kimblee was imprisoned in Central City for several years after his official involvement in the Ishval Civil War for having infamously turned his unique brand of combustion-based combat alchemy on people who were not on his government-approved kill list. Due to conspiratorial acts at the top of government, Kimblee is officially exonerated of his crimes so as to serve as the Führer`s hidden left hand in the secret battles to come.
As a result of the schism between the storylines of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga and the 2003 anime series, Solf J. Kimblee appears prominently in both but is a rather different character in each.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Selim Bradley is the son of http://anidb.net/ch10175 [King Bradley], the Führer of Amestris. Due to the divergence between the manga and the 2003 anime series, Selim is portrayed as two very different characters in both the canons.
In the 2003 anime, he is merely the Führer`s timid biological child, appearing late in the series. Young Selim discovers the skull that constitutes Pride`s remains and is trusted by his father with guarding it, calling it his treasure. Flushed with pride, he gladly takes the responsibility. However, Selim accidentally wanders into the scene of Bradley and http://anidb.net/ch6586 [Roy Mustang]`s fight at the end of the series, with the skull wrapped inside a towel. As a Homunculus, King Bradley is severely weakened by the proximity of his human remains, allowing Mustang to gain the upper hand and remove the sword piercing his shoulder. In a fit of rage, the Führer strangles his son, killing him. Mustang then grabs the skull and draws a transmutation circle in his own blood on it, igniting a now weakened Bradley and in the process reducing him to a pile of ash, killing him instantly. After using the skull to kill the Homunculus, Mustang picks up Selim`s body and carries it outside the burning manor. It is unknown what becomes of Selim`s body.
In the manga series, Selim first appears in volume 8 as the Führer`s sprightly son. He frequently asks his father to tell him stories from the battlefront and interesting anecdotes from his everyday goings-on. Selim professes a desire to become a State Alchemist so as to be more useful to the Führer and is a self-professed fan of http://anidb.net/ch5885 [Edward Elric]. It is revealed that Selim is not Bradley`s biological son, but rather adopted from a distant relative. When http://anidb.net/ch6587 [Riza Hawkeye] hears from Mrs. Bradley that Selim comes from her husband`s side, she discovers the awful truth: that Selim Bradley is actually the Homunculus known as "Pride".</description>

He plays chess with Roy Mustang when the transfer to central has came for Roy, Roy then bests the Lieutenant General in a game of chess to which the General gives him the board (And pieces) as a farewell gift.
He is an old man that takes a lighthearted approach to his command. When Roy Mustang transfers from Eastern Headquarters to Central, Grumman authorizes the transfer of Mustang`s subordinates, including his granddaughter http://anidb.net/ch6587 [Riza Hawkeye] (though it is unknown if she is aware of this relationship). After the Homunculi strip Mustang of his subordinates, he calls for Grumman`s aid. Grumman, not under the Homunculi`s surveillance, acts on Mustang`s behalf in intelligence gathering and communication, going as far as dressing up like an old woman to not be spotted in Central. Though a willing and powerful ally, he is reluctant to openly work against the military; as being branded a traitor would make it difficult to become the next leader of Amestris.
It is implied in a joke that Grumman doesn`t do anything in the East City Headquaters when he says to Roy: "Now that your transfer to central has become final, I may have to start doing things around here again.", although this may just be an inside joke between the two. Grumman makes a brief cameo in Conqueror of Shamballa. He is implied to have replaced http://anidb.net/ch10175 [King Bradley] as the leader of Amestris.</description>

He grew up, lived and worked in Resembool as a surgeon alongside his wife, http://anidb.net/ch16495 [Sara Rockbell]. When the Ishval Civil War reached its peak, the two Doctors Rockbell reluctantly left their family home in Resembool to help treat the wounded on the front lines. Though both Amestrian, the Rockbells were rather well known in the Kanda region of Ishval for treating the injured on either side of the conflict. Though many, including http://anidb.net/ch10165 [Doctors Marcoh] and http://anidb.net/ch14964 [Knox], viewed them as a medical inspiration and several Ishvalan people owe their lives to the husband and wife medical team, officials the Amestrian military began to view their humanitarian effort as a nuisance and sought to have them killed. In the manga, http://anidb.net/ch14594 [Solf J. Kimblee] is unofficially ordered to kill them and stage their deaths as an accident so that the military would not be forced to waste resources ensuring their protection as humanitarians of their nation, but before the Red Lotus Alchemist could arrive on the scene, the Rockbells are killed by http://anidb.net/ch6593 [Scar], who had just awakened in their makeshift medical centre and was driven into a violent rage upon learning that his brother was dead. In the 2003 anime series, the Rockbells are officially ordered executed as insurgents because their Ishvalan patients would return to the battlefield after treatment. http://anidb.net/ch6586 [Roy Mustang] is ordered to carry out the execution against his will.</description>

<description>Sara Rockbell was a surgeon and the mother of http://anidb.net/ch6588 [Winry Rockbell]. She married into the Rockbell family by wedding http://anidb.net/ch16494 [Urey Rockbell], http://anidb.net/ch10164 [Pinako Rockbell]`s son and practiced medicine alongside her husband. When the Ishval Civil War reached its peak, the two Doctors Rockbell reluctantly left their family home in Resembool to help treat the wounded on the front lines. Though both Amestrian, the Rockbells were rather well known in the Kanda region of Ishval for treating the injured on either side of the conflict.

Sara was a rather tenacious woman, refusing to leave Ishval with the other Amestrian civilians when given the option by her husband. She gives the excuse that Winry and Pinako would never forgive her if she abandoned her calling and reminds Urey that Rockbell women are strong (though she is only a Rockbell by marriage).</description>

<description>Scar`s brother is a minor character in the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise, and appears in the manga version and both anime versions of the story. He is responsible for saving his brother`s life during the war in Ishval, sacrificing himself and giving away his right arm, which later allows http://anidb.net/ch6593 [Scar] to kill state alchemists. He is never seen in the present time as he died during the Ishval Massacre, but he is seen in several flashbacks. Like his brother, his name has never been revealed.</description>

<name>Dominic LeCoulte</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Dominic is a gruff, anti-social old automail engineer who lives in the mountains on the outskirts of Rush Valley. Having spotted the young http://anidb.net/ch14968 [Paninya] after the accident that left her unable to move on her own, Dominic took her with him and created high quality automail limbs for her to use (under the pretense that her lifeless, self-pity annoyed him). Though decidedly mean on the outside, Dominic occasionally shows that he is a kind person with a loving heart and a great passion for automail. Prodigiously skilled in his craft, Dominic has stated that it is his dream to internalize sophisticated weaponry such as carbines in automail limbs without sacrificing their standard shape and size. As such, he has fitted Paninya`s right leg with a hidden shin blade and her right with a 1.5 inch carbine. Though well known, he has no interest in taking on apprentices and repeatedly turns http://anidb.net/ch6588 [Winry Rockbell] down for the position when she asks, but refers her to Atelier Garfiel in Rush Valley. Additionally, he seems to have had a rather traumatic history with http://anidb.net/ch10164 [Pinako Rockbell], trembling in horror at the mere mention of her name and referring to her as "The Pantheress of Resembool".</description>

<description>Garfiel is a skilled automail engineer and the proprietor of Atelier Garfiel in the town of Rush Valley. When http://anidb.net/ch6588 [Winry Rockbell] is referred to him by http://anidb.net/ch16497 [Dominic], Garfiel is only too happy to accept the cute young girl as his live-in apprentice and joins the rest of the Rush Valley community in treating her like a beloved family member. Garfiel is rather effeminate and appears to prefer the company of men, which results in his acting largely as a source of comic relief in scenes that involve him.</description>

<description>Mrs. Bradley is the wife of the Führer, http://anidb.net/ch10175 [King Bradley]. A kind and trusting wife, she has no idea that her devoted husband is inhuman and remains blissfully ignorant of the homunculi`s existence and dastardly plans. Though she rarely appears in either series, usually accompanying http://anidb.net/ch14960 [Selim], Mrs. Bradley`s appearances usually fall under the category of comic relief as she speaks jovially of her familial life and romantic past with the Führer.
Mrs. Bradley is later on kidnapped by http://anidb.net/ch6586 [Roy Mustang] under the cover of the night. Though he has no intentions of harming her, Mustang hopes to use the Fuhrer`s wife as a sort of shield against Central`s forces in his uprising against the city. When direct orders from Brigadier General Clemin call for everyone but Mustang to be killed -- including Mrs. Bradley, she begins to truly question her husband`s emotions towards her and her entire life. Under the pretense that it was the government itself which had betrayed the Bradley family, Mrs. Bradley is taken to a local radio station by http://anidb.net/ch10166 [Maria Ross], http://anidb.net/ch14596 [Kain Fuery] and http://anidb.net/ch14598 [Heymans Breda], where she makes it clear there had been an attempt made against her life to a nationwide audience. She is eventually told that her husband had been in a fatal train explosion, making her almost faint from the shock.</description>

<description>Second Lieutenant Henschel is an Amestrian State Military Officer stationed at Fort Briggs and one of http://anidb.net/ch13409 [Major General Olivier Mira Armstrong]`s loyal subordinates. After the inadvertent attack on Briggs by the Homunculus http://anidb.net/ch13408 [Sloth], Henschel opposes the sealing of the tunnel`s opening proposed by http://anidb.net/ch14961 [Lt. General Raven] because he fears for the soldiers who had been sent in to examine the channel. Though the Major General initially appears to ignore Henschel`s protests, she reveals to him in secret that http://anidb.net/ch5885 [Edward Elric] had alchemically created a second entrance behind Raven`s back. Along with http://anidb.net/ch13410 [Captain Buccaneer] and a few others, 2nd Lt. Henschel enters the tunnel and is overjoyed to find a pair of survivors despite the apparent carnage caused by the Homunculus Pride. After Major General Armstrong is transferred to Central Command, Henschel discusses the coming change of regime with Buccaneer and the two agree that Central`s impending flunkies have no idea what to expect from Briggs` soldiers.
When an armada of Briggs soldiers are smuggled into Central City through the Armstrong Family mansion, 2nd Lt. Henschel is among them and participates valiantly in the coup d`etat on The Promised Day.</description>

<description>Storch is an Amestrian State Military Officer stationed in Central City and the personal secretary of the Führer, http://anidb.net/ch10175 [King Bradley], until http://anidb.net/ch6587 [Lt.

He arrives outside Central Command to deliver Hawkeye`s new orders personally and is accompanied by Yakovlev from Internal Affairs. Storch reappears in Chapter 98, arriving outside Central Command upon hearing that Bradley has returned from his mysterious absence and directing the cadre of Central troops waiting for orders from their Führer. As Storch orders the soldiers into the compound and attempts to establish contact with any loyal soldiers within the fortress, his platoon is incapacitated and he is knocked unconscious by http://anidb.net/ch10405 [Fuu].</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Brigadier General Fessler was the Amestrian military officer put in charge of securing the Kanda region of Ishval during the Ishval Civil War. A petty and ignorant man, Fessler was more concerned with enhancing his reputation than with the lives of his subordinates and, in his obsession with clearing out his region before the other officers, made a number of hasty decisions which cost many soldiers` lives.
When Major http://anidb.net/ch6589 [Alex Louis Armstrong] had his mental breakdown from the emotional strain of massacring Ishvalan civilians, Fessler made it worse by berating him and even when his mistakes were devastating to his own troops, he referred to them as "home runs" so long as the mission objective was reached. When Colonel http://anidb.net/ch10893 [Basque Grand] escorted Logue Lowe to Fessler with the hopes of gaining an audience with http://anidb.net/ch10175 [King Bradley], Fessler stubbornly refused and ordered all his soldiers to return to the fray, at which point he was shot point-blank in the chest by Grand`s rifle. Though there were several witnesses to the blatant assassination, all the soldiers present agreed that Fessler`s death had been caused by a stray bullet, truly signifying how much they hated him and his methods. Fessler`s post as commander of Kanda was succeeded by Basque Grand.</description>

<description>Madame Christmas is the proprietor of a hostess bar in Central City frequently patronaged by http://anidb.net/ch6586 [Colonel Roy Mustang]. At first, it would merely seem that this bar is further proof of Mustang`s unapologetic debauchery, but it becomes quite apparent that the women under Madame Christmas` care act as secret informants to Mustang and his squad and that Madame Christmas herself is a skilled intelligencer and contact between Roy and http://anidb.net/ch14966 [Lt. General Grumman] in East City.
A rather gruff woman, Madame Christmas is frequently sharp with Roy. It has been recently revealed by a secret investigation into Roy`s past carried out by Central Command`s agents that Madame Christmas` real name is Chris Mustang and that she is Roy`s foster mother. Well aware of Roy`s ambitions as well as the clandestine goings-on of his enemies, Madame Christmas expects great things of her little boy.
In Character Guidebook 3 released recently in Japan it`s revealed Chris Mustang is actually the younger sister to Roy`s biological father, making her his aunt. According to this guide, she took Roy in after the death of both his parents, when Roy was still very young.</description>

He loses his left leg during the war, resulting in his current peg leg. This does not slow him down, as he has adopted this peg leg to his combat style.</description>

<summary>Edward and Alphonse hear of a blind alchemist named Judeau who had supposedly performed a successful human transmutation. Meeting up with him, Jude reveals to Edward that a young girl named Rosalie Harbinger was resurrected through alchemy, with his eyes paid for in equivalent exchange. However, the madame refuses to teach Edward about the techniques used. Rosalie leads Alphonse to a room with a little girl`s shriveled corpse inside. She reveals this as the result of the real Rosalie`s transmutation, while she herself is a girl named Amy, who was adopted due to her similar appearance to Rosalie. As Edward arrives on the scene, the madame tells him that her late husband kept the truth about the transmutation failure from Judeau, who truly wanted to resurrect Rosalie. The Elric brothers then leave carrying this knowledge with them as well.</summary>

<summary>Back when Izumi was eighteen years old, she had traveled to meet the alchemist Silver Steiner and had requested to be his apprentice. Giving her only a knife, he had told her to survive one month on the summit of Briggs before she can become his apprentice. On the second day, she had been found by some of guards of Briggs Fortress, but had managed to beat them and take their food rations. On the eighth day, she had been close to starving to death, but then had become motivated to survive. As she had learned to defend herself and live off of the wildlife, she had realized the meaning behind alchemy, saying that one is all, and all is one. However, returning after a month, it is revealed she had been talking to Silver`s older brother, Gold Steiner, who is not an alchemist but rather a hand-to-hand combat specialist. Annoyed, Izumi beats him and leaves. This ends with an exaggerated look on the first meeting between Izumi and Sig.</summary>

<summary>The story centers around Mustang, at eighteen years of age, in a military boot camp. After encountering a group of seniors being cruel to an Ishvalan recruit named Heathcliff Erbe, Mustang takes interest in Hughes, who is supposedly friends with them. The two soon become rivals, competing in various events. Mustang later catches the seniors picking on Heathcliff again and gets into a fight with them before Hughes backs him up, having the same beliefs as Mustang. The three become friends and discuss their reasons for joining the military. Later, though, during the Ishvalan war, Mustang ends up fighting against Heathcliff, who is killed by Hughes after shooting at Mustang. However, Mustang falls into despair before being confronted by Hughes, who has to hold in the pain of his sins so he can smile in front of his wife. Upon returning home, Mustang sees Hughes reuniting with his wife, and envies Hughes`s strength.</summary>
