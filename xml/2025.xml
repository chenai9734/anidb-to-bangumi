<description>* Based on a series of light novels by http://anidb.net/cr8522 [Konno Oyuki].
It is now spring, and a new term is about to start at the Lillian Academy. The relationships between the Roses continue to unfold.
With the entry of http://anidb.net/ch1193 [Sachiko]`s distant relative, http://anidb.net/ch7091 [Matsudaira Touko], http://anidb.net/ch1192 [Yumi]`s position as Sachiko`s petite soeur is threatened. Yumi desperately tries to keep Sachiko`s waning attention, praying that people`s feelings, unlike a chrysanthemum`s colour, do not change.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<tag id="2607" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2009-04-29">
<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<tag id="2608" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2012-12-04">
<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

When not "at the job" this means getting up in the morning, making meals, house cleaning, going shopping or out to eat, visiting the bath house or spa, leisure activities in the spare time, etc. The time "on the job" for students is School Life, for others working in their profession. Daily Life is basically a synonym for everything normal, repetitive, and trivial happening to your average person.</description>

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school.

And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<description>It is tradition in Japan to celebrate the new year at a Shinto shrine (hatsumode). The protagonists will offer some money, ring a bell at the end of a thick rope, and then pray for good fortune.
This usually goes along with gorging yourself at the many temporary food stalls, playing various games, and drawing a fortune.
The female characters in the anime will usually dress up in a kimono, to show off their traditional Japanese clothing, while watching the fireworks.</description>

<description>Hanami (花見, lit. "flower viewing") is the Japanese traditional custom of enjoying the beauty of flowers, "flower" in this case almost always meaning cherry blossoms or ume blossoms. 
From the end of March to early May, sakura bloom all over Japan, and around the first of February on the island of Okinawa. The blossom forecast (桜前線 sakurazensen, literally cherry blossom front) is announced each year by the weather bureau, and is watched carefully by those planning hanami as the blossoms only last a week or two. 
In modern-day Japan, hanami mostly consists of having an outdoor party beneath the sakura during daytime or at night. Hanami at night is called yozakura (夜桜, literally night sakura).

<name>melodrama</name>
<description>A melodrama is a dramatic work that exaggerates plot and characters in order to appeal to the emotions, often with strongly stereotyped characters. Language, behaviour, or events which resemble melodramas are also called melodramatic. In scholarly and historical musical contexts melodramas are dramas of the 18th and 19th centuries in which orchestral music or song was used to accompany the action.
Melodrama is a style of drama that has been applied on the stage, in movies and television, and radio formats, from the 18th century to the present. Because of the long timeframe in which the style has existed, it is difficult to derive a precise definition. The term melodrama is most often used pejoratively, to suggest that the work to which the term is applied lacks sophistication or subtlety.
The term originated from the early 19th-century French word mélodrame, which is derived from Greek melos, music, and French drame, drama (from Late Latin drāma, which in turn derives from Greek drān, to do, perform).

<description>Fukuzawa Yumi is the main character of the series. In the beginning of the series, Yumi is bashful beyond words, very timid and unsure of herself. She first met http://anidb.net/ch1193 [Sachiko], the star of Lillian School and had her tie fixed by Sachiko, which mortified Yumi. Yumi`s friend, http://anidb.net/ch27888 [Takeshima Tsutaka], took a cute picture of this and wanted to display it in the school festival. Tsutako got Yumi to ask permission from Sachiko. Other characters often comment on how her emotions `show on her face`.

<description>Ogasawara Sachiko is a student in her 2nd year at the Lillian Girls` Academy. Though prim, elegant and somewhat aloof, Sachiko has both a rough and a very sweet side. She is afraid of heights and dislikes men, to the point where she will do anything she can to avoid interacting or being near one. She is very protective of her petite sœur, http://anidb.net/ch1192 [Fukuzawa Yumi], and cares deeply about her. Unfortunately, she often has the same problem that Yumi does—she does not share most of her problems with her sœur, causing many misunderstandings.
Sachiko is slated to marry her cousin and fiancé http://anidb.net/ch15124 [Kashiwagi Suguru] after she graduates. This has caused her some distress since, because although she initially cared deeply for him, but he did not reciprocate. They now have a complicated relationship.

<description>Mizuno Youko is a student in her 3rd year at the Lillian Girls` Academy and http://anidb.net/ch1193 [Ogasawara Sachiko]`s grande sœur. As the nearly indisputable leader of the Yamayurikai during her time as Rosa Chinensis, she played a major role in maintaining stability in its sometimes unstable environment. Though usually cool and refined, she was also known to have a fun side. She made Sachiko her petite sœur in a situation happened like Sachiko did to http://anidb.net/ch1192 [Yumi].

<name>Satou Sei</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Satou Sei is the exact opposite of most of the characters in the series: loud, rough-around-the-edges, she loves doing what she can to push other peoples` buttons. She especially finds joy in teasing http://anidb.net/ch1192 [Yumi] (and also enjoys irritating http://anidb.net/ch1193 [Sachiko] in the process) as she likes to see their reactions; Yumi affectionately calls that her "old man" behavior. However, Sei is one of the wisest and most caring characters in the series. Though seeming to have a playful and laid-back attitude, Sei has experienced many tragedies in her life, especially in her second year. Sei believes that http://anidb.net/ch1197 [Shimako], her petite sœur, should learn to solve her problems on her own, because that way she`ll become stronger.
While the relationship between Sei and Shimako seems cold, the truth is that Shimako is extremely devoted to Sei. Their relationship, as Yumi noted, is something that cannot be easily understood. After graduating from the high school division of Lillian, Sei studies English and American Literature at Lillian University.

During http://anidb.net/ch1193 [Sachiko]`s initial attempt to perform the sœur ritual on http://anidb.net/ch1192 [Yumi] in front of the entire student council body, Shimako was the only one who considered Yumi`s feelings of being forced to be one, and was brave enough to voice it out.

<description>Nijou Noriko is a young girl with a fascination with Buddhist statues and art. She enters Lillian Academy (a strictly Catholic institution) due to an unexpected turn of events. Due to this fact, she faces an astounding cultural shock (from the old-fashioned style school uniform to the students` mannerisms that she finds too antique and too "refined" to get accustomed to). Even in the novel`s narrative, Shimako is referred as "Shimako-san" from Noriko`s perspective, and not the usual "Shimako-sama" as default to all upper-classmen, and the fact that she hardly uses polite Japanese when talking to Shimako in private, also defines Noriko`s detachment from Lillian`s culture. She has a striaghtforward temper that contradicts her calm exterior and becomes Shimako`s petite sœur after Shimako enters her second year. Her very plain and jet-black hairstyle makes her look like a traditional Japanese doll, another stark contrast to Shimako`s "western doll" appearance.</description>

<description>At the beginning of the series, Shimazu Yoshino is shown as frail girl who was constantly being cared for by her grande sœur, http://anidb.net/ch1201 [Hasekura Rei]. She was voted for the best petite sœur as everyone considered her to be soft and sweet. However, Yoshino is very independent and in some ways tomboyish, despite her sickly status and feminine appearance.
After her heart surgery, she became more energetic throughout the series and http://anidb.net/ch1192 [Yumi] began to see more of her fits of temper, which were usually directed towards Rei. In addition to being Rei`s petite sœur, Yoshino is also her cousin and next-door neighbor. She admires and loves Rei, but becomes upset with her every time she acts overprotective and fragile.
