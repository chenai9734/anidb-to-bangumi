<description>http://anidb.net/ch52146 [Akko], http://anidb.net/ch52147 [Lotte] and http://anidb.net/ch52144 [Sucy] get into trouble yet again and are forced to team up with three other troublemakers: http://anidb.net/ch74492 [Amanda O`Neill], http://anidb.net/ch74493 [Constanze Braunschbank Albrechtsberger] and http://anidb.net/ch74494 [Jasmineka Antonenko] in order to make an annual witch parade a success or else face expulsion. Not content with how the festival revolves around the mockery and subjugation of witches, Akko becomes determined to make the festival a spectacle that`ll show how awesome modern witches are.

<description>Magic is the art of purportedly manipulating aspects of reality either by supernatural means or through knowledge of unknown occult laws.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>comedy</name>
<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

Hailing from Great Britain as daughter of a noble family of witches, she has a serious and arrogant nature and oftentimes clashes with http://anidb.net/ch52146 [Akko], whom she holds in disdain for her impulsive nature and admiration of http://anidb.net/ch53389 [Shiny Chariot]. Despite this, Diana is secretly a childhood fan of Chariot herself, and gradually develops a grudging respect for Akko.

<description>Ursula Callistis is an astrology teacher at Luna Nova.
Her real identity is Chariot du Nord, a famous witch and alumni of Luna Nova who performed under the name http://anidb.net/ch53389 [Shiny Chariot] and inspired http://anidb.net/ch52146 [Akko] to become a witch. Her chosen mission was to use her magic skills to bring joy to people`s hearts. She mysteriously disappeared from the public eye ten years ago after her former friend http://anidb.net/ch89470 [Croix] tricked her into employing a sinister type of magic, which stripped Akko of her latent magical powers as a child. Now living and teaching incognito at Luna Nova, she takes Akko as a personal student after she notices her strong desire to become a witch, which enables her to use the Shiny Rod and unseal the lost seven words to the Grand Triskelion, in order to make up for her guilt.
