<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="540669">Great style, a bit chaotic but good story and overall keept me intressted throughout.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="12332">Stunning Shaft aesthetics and interesting story, however it is not a masterpiece as some of Monogatari elements. The graphical side is kind of slightly simplified copy of the Monogatari one, still it is really good but not just not as good. Then the story: chaotic but this chaos seem to lead somewhere. It is like a promise that if you bare with it and care to pick up the pieces they will fall in place eventually. And they do, really do but just when they start to do so the story suddenly drifts into cliche. Music is nice and important part of the whole experience, sometimes tells the story as in the musical, definitely strong part of the show. But just do not expect great hits here as again they are not here. So everything is quite good here, but just not great. Watching it many times I had a feeling that this is wasted potential. Still I don`t think I lost my time on it. I enjoyed it for the most part and I think it can be recommended as entry level sample of Shaft original style.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="619127">This one deserves a much higher rating. Aside from the stunning visuals, I loved the actual plot and the way it was presented (the ending could use a bit more work though). It`s confusing at first, but give it some time and it`ll start making sense soon enough.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="626835">good anime,worth to watch it all</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="526435">This has been rage rated because it`s slow-paced and the story is fractured and there are a lot of implications. Recall last time when you watch a movie, a lot of people can`t understand what`s happening but you follow the story easily? If that`s the case, then this anime is for you!</recommendation>

<description>* Based on Kagerou Project, a series of Vocaloid songs made by Shizen no Teki-P aka http://anidb.net/cr38122 [Jin] which are mostly made by IA voicebank.
http://anidb.net/ch65892 [Shintarou] is an 18 years old HikiNEET who hasn`t left home for two years. One day he was forced to go outside and buy an new keyboard by http://anidb.net/ch63166 [Ene], a mysterious virus-like cybergirl living in his PC.
At the same time a robbery takes place at the shopping district. As a hostage himself, he meets two other hostages who introduce themselves as http://anidb.net/ch67818 [Mekakushi-dan] (Blindfold Gang). This encounter drags Shintarou into the group where he meets other teenagers who have superpower abilities in their eyes. The group is all about finding other people who have eye abilities, recruiting them and teaching them to control their powers.
Things get more twisted as more and more of Shintarou`s close acquaintances seem to have connection to this odd group which seems to have one more goal behind it: to find the truth behind their powers.</description>

Amnesia is fairly common in fiction as a plot device. In fact, because it allows for major plot changes while requiring little creativity from the author, it may be subject to heavy overuse.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<description>Even though school clubs in Japan are not mandatory, there is some pressure from the social grid (e.g. fellow students, teachers) to participate in some kind of after-school activity, be it in sports or arts. Colleges also have clubs.
As a comedy element in anime, some students have joined too many clubs, and are thus constantly stressed out. There is also the element of social commentary, making it clear that you have to join a club, if you want to be part of the class. Since self-founded clubs need at least 3 members, the desperate search and advertising for new members can be cause for hilarity in anime.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

<name>in medias res</name>
<description>In medias res, also medias in res (Latin for "into the midst of affairs (lit. into mid-affairs)"), refers to a literary and artistic technique where the narrative starts in the middle of the story instead of from its beginning. It is generally a plot-driven concept rather than a character-driven one; though characters are commonly used to provide the backstory. The characters, setting, and conflict are often introduced through a series of flashbacks or through characters relating past events to each other.
Probably originating from an oral tradition, the technique is a convention of epic poetry, one of the earliest and most prominent examples in Western literature being Homer`s Odyssey and Iliad. Virgil`s Aeneid began the tradition in literature of imitating Homer, continued in Torquato Tasso`s Jerusalem Delivered, John Milton`s Paradise Lost and "Inferno" from Dante`s Divine Comedy. George Lucas`s Star Wars saga was told using in medias res.</description>

<name>ensemble cast</name>
<description>A show with an ensemble cast focuses on a larger group of main characters in a single plot narrative; anime containing several segmented plot narratives (such as episodic or arc-based plots) are excluded. As such, it doesn`t really have a "main" or "lead" character; instead, every member of the central main character group plays an important part in the show`s grander scheme; no single character is more important or prominent than the others (equality of importance). Further, subplots (if any) lead by each character in the ensemble have equal weighting in importance (or lack of weight).

* In a show where no single main character is more important or prominent than the others, 4+ main characters is almost always an ensemble cast.
* A show with 3 main characters of equal importance is likely also an ensemble cast; equality of importance must be considered carefully.
* A show with 2 main characters of equal importance is generally not an ensemble cast situation; however, on an exception basis where neither main character is considered an antagonist, a 2-main-character anime may be considered an ensemble (e.g. http://anidb.net/a11829 [Kimi no Na wa.]).

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

<description>Be careful what you wish for... your wish may actually come true. This is an age-old philosophical problem of what human beings think they want and what is actually good for them. The power to wish for anything can be very dangerous and usually — as a moral lesson — yields unexpected / unwanted results.
A contract with the devil is a specific case of this; receiving great power, especially from a devil, is usually a double edged sword.</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<description>A time loop is a common plot device in science fiction (especially in universes where time travel is commonplace). Events in the story repeat themselves a number of times with or without some variation with each pass. Most characters either do not realise this is occurring or are attempting to break the cycle in some way. 
One well-known example of this is in the 1993 film Groundhog Day, in which the main character is the only one aware of the time loop, although time loops had appeared in many fictional works prior to that. Stories with time loops commonly center on correcting past mistakes or on getting a character to recognise some key truth; escape from the loop may then follow.</description>

<name>season</name>
<description>A season is a division of the year, marked by changes in weather, ecology, and hours of daylight. Seasons result from the yearly orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth`s rotational axis relative to the plane of the orbit. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth`s surface, variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.
During May, June, and July, the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun. The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December, January, and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere.
In temperate and subpolar regions, four calendar-based seasons (with their adjectives) are generally recognized: spring (vernal), summer (estival), autumn (autumnal), fall and winter (hibernal). Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring (prevernal) and late summer (serotinal) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four.

His ability is "Awaken". This ability makes him shift into the body he finds ideal. He also possesses abnormal physical strength.
Konoha is a kind and caring boy living with Hyori`s sister as a foster child. He suffers from amnesia, he only knows his name, and has no memory of his past and knows nothing from outside world. He befriends Hyori and Hibiya and later tries to save them from void space.
He also is a glutten and has an odd attachment to Hibiya`s cooking.
Konoha is in fact Haruka. Haruka dies and enters the void space (Heat Haze). Then he acquires Awakening power and changes to a powerful ideal body. This, however, caused him to loose all of his memory. So after escaping from the void, he remains without any memory of himself and his past.
Konoha is in fact one of Haruka`s favorite illustrations of a powerful game character.
His songs are: "Konoha no Sekai Jijou" (Konoha`s World Affairs) which is a retell of a "Kageru Daze" story which he is the witness of Hyori and Hibiya`s countless deaths, yet is unable to save them, and "Outer Science" which tells a story about the trauma of "awakening" his eyes which leads him to change his form.</description>

<description>Kido is the number 1 member of the Blindfold group and currently acts as the leader and is called "Danchou" (team leader) by some of the other members.
Her ability is "Conceal". She can hide herself from the eye of others at will. She was grown up in the same orphanage as Seto and Kano.
She has tomboy personality but still shows some womanly acts at time. her extreme introvert nature makes her look odd to others.

She and her sister were trapped in house fire and got caught in a void Space (Heat Haze), her sister was swallowed by the haze and saves Kido by forcing her to escape. Tateyama Family laer adopted her along with Kano and Seto.
Kido`s song is: "Mekakushi Code" Which is mostly about the group rather than her own life.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Momo is the number 5 member of the Blindfold group.
Her ability is "Captivation". She can capture the attention of any people to herself, regardless of what she is doing or wearing. This ability made her to be a very popular idol who is loved by everyone. She is rather unable to control her powers and thus is unable to have a normal life. On an attempt to be a normal girl which fails, Kido recruits her into the gang.
She constantly hangs out with Kido since her power can cancel Momo`s.
Just like the other members of the group, she acquired her ability after having a near death experience. She was drowning in the sea and her father dived to rescue her. They enter the Void Space (Heat Haze). Momo managed to escape while leaving her dad behind.
Her songs are: "Kisaragi Attention" which tells her everyday struggles to be a normal girl and "Otsukimi Recital" (Moon Viewing Recital) which tells the story of her attempts to cheer up her brother after the death of his best friend, Ayano.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kano is the number 3 member of the Blindfold group. He was the one who came up with the name mekakushidan.
His ability is "Deceive". This makes him to change how people see him or feel about him. He is also able to make Illusions for others. Unlike Seto, he constantly uses his ability to hie his true feelings from others. He also constantly uses illusion so people wont see him in emotional moments. He has a playful devil nature and enjoys messing with Kido by mentioning her weak points while talking ironically. In the anime, its showed that he also has some masochistic sides in him, since he constantly messes with Kido which is always followed by her physical reactions toward him.
Just like the other members of the group, he acquired her ability after having a near death experience.
He used to live with his single mom. His mother`s unstable personality made her loose her control from time to time and hit Kano. Which made him to constantly blame himself for being hit, because of not being a good boy. On the day of the accident, their apartment was broken-in by thieves. His mother was stabbed to death while trying to protect his son. which also followed by Kido getting stabbed too. there, they were dragged to void Space (Heat Haze). Kano managed to escape and left his mom behind.
Tateyama Family later adopted him along with Kido and Seto.
It seems that his minor masochistic desires have roots in his childhood, because he was used to get hit by his mom.
However he constantly uses his powers to change how people see and feel about him. So, he always is enigmatic to others. No one is able to understand and predict him fully because he refuses to open up.
His song is: Yobanashi Deceive (Night Tales Deceive). In the song, Kano tells a very dramatic and shounen-like story about himself and brags about his superpowers. He reveals that all of it were made-up at the end.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Seto is the number 1 member of the Blindfold group and is often portrayed as the "nice guy" of the group.
His ability is "Steal". He can read the mind of people within eye contact. As shown in the anime, he is also able to focus and read people`s minds in a large distances too. However he himself dislikes his ability and rarely uses it because "It`ll make Communication redundant". However this made him to posses an enigmatic personality in the inside while being extremely nice and energetic on the outside to the point that only Kano and Kido seem to be able to understand his true desires.
Just like the other members of the group, he acquired her ability after having a near death experience. As a child, he had communication problems and his timid nature made him the center of the bullies. Being unable to make friends, he considered an abondand dog as his buddy. On a stormy night, the bully kids at the street tried to bother him by throwing his dog into the river. Seto dives in to save his dog. After drawning, he and his dog were caught in the void space (Heat Haze). Seto managed to escape while leaving his dog behind.
Tateyama Family later adopted him along with Kano and Kido.
His ability and him being unable to control it made him try to suicide once, when he met Marry at his suicide scene and recruited her.
Its hinted that his attachment to Marry is for his interest in cute, petit and fluffy things.
His song is: Shounen Brave (The Brave Boy) which tells the story of his past.</description>

<description>The Blindfold Gang consists of teenagers who each posses special abilities in their own eyes. Their base is the former house of Tateyama family.
The 3 main group members Kano, Seto and Kido were adopted by Tateyama family and made the gang after encouragement of the family`s daughter, Ayano. Ayano became the leader, but after her mysterious death, Kido took the leadership.
The group seems to be all about finding more members who posses eye abilities, recruiting them and helping them to control their powers. But their main goal is to find the truth behind their powers, what triggers people to show it and what happened to "lost people".</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Takane was the human form of "Ene". As a human, Takane was ranked second in the country on a game called `Dead Bullet -1989-` under the name of "Senkou no Maihime" (Dancing Princess of the Spotlight) and often stayed up late at night playing. This caused her often to have a bad-tempered personality.
She used to suffer from an illness which caused her to lose consciousness at random times. Because of this, she was placed in a separate class at school with http://anidb.net/ch67822 [Kokonose Haruka].
They put up a gaming booth in their class, which led to her meeting Ayano -the daughter of their homeroom teacher- along with Shintarou, which they later started to be friends.
She died due to unknown reasons after loosing consciousness on the school hallway and woke up to find herself in the body of a cybergirl, living in the cyber world.
She then transferred herself to Shintarou`s PC to be a cheer up for him in the sad times after loosing their mutual friend, Ayano. She doesn`t reveal her true identities to Shintarou.
Its hinted that Tateyama was involved in her death, as well as Haruka`s.
Takane harbors strong feelings towards Haruka. She regrets the fact that she was never been able to confess it to him.
Her songs are: "Headphone Actor" which tells a fictional story about her trying to escape the city which is falling, to reach a certain person, and "Yukei Yesterday" (Yesterday Evening) which is a story about she and Haruka and her feelings toward him</description>

<description>Kokonose Haruka was the human form of http://anidb.net/ch63168 [Konoha]. As a human, he had weak body and was constantly hospitalized, even though he had high academics, being in normal classes was a harbor to him, therefore he was put in a separate class with http://anidb.net/ch67821 [Enemoto Takane].
He died due to unknown reasons after loosing consciousness in the classroom. Whe he wakes up in hospital he is dragged into Void Space (Heat Haze), where he revealed his true desires of having a normal body. He switched bodies with one of his favorite illustrations, turning him to a superpower being but he lost his memory on the go.
As Konoha, he seems to have no memory of the past and his human form, unlike Takane, who is fully aware of her past and her situations.
It`s hinted that Tateyama was involved in his death, as well as Takane`s.
Haruka harbors feelings towards Takane, also not exactly hinted as love, his last words as a living human was yearning to see her again.
His songs are: "Yukei Yesterday" (Yesterday Evening), which is a story about him and Takane and his feelings toward her, and "Summertime Record" which is narrated by him at the end of the series.</description>
