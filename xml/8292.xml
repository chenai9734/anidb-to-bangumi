<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="79179">to me, this is interesting, a very unusual story, first of its kind. anime was suppose to be relaxing and enjoying. even thou the setting is stupid, but who cares as long as we are entertained.

It does remind me of the days i am starving due to overtime work. 

and the fan service isnt excessive like maken-ki. its more tamed down.
i deeply recommend this to people.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="152183">Very well-done fight scenes, little to no plot, or at least none that holds your interest. If all you care about is people fighting over bargain food with a bit of fan service and comedy, then this is the anime for you. If you hate butt-monkey protagonists who never get vindicated, then not so much.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="176590">Bento throws away any "plot" and gets away with being a very entertaining series about "jokes and fights". It also has a great soundtrack.
Unfortunately the moments when it takes itself seriously arent very memorable, and the series basically implodes after the first arc. Also: VERY anticlimatic ending.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="296921">Has to be the stupidest thing I`ver ever seen (which is saying something given all the years I`ve been watching anime)!
I guess the premise is supposed to be light-hearted, silly fun but me it just made sick.
Another entry for animes with situations and characters overdrawn in such a tone-deaf manner as to preclude almost all enjoyment you might otherwise be able to derive from the production values (which are, unfortunately, gorgeous).
Sample at your own risk.

The above should be seen as referring mostly to the first and second-but-last episodes.
In between those, I have to admit, its hilarious.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="496535">It took a few episodes to grow on me, but I had a lot of fun with this one. The characters are actually somewhat unique, and the absurdity of the plot did not prevent it from being coherent. Well animated, and downright funny at times. I would say give it a try!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="395402">people that fight over food, what there is not to like about that.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="521092">Makes you laugh, makes you hungry.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="41529">If you enjoy anime that has well animated fighting sequences but dislike tedious backstory for every character you meet, then this show is probably for you. The show itself doesn`t take itself too seriously, but the characters in the show obviously take their situation seriously which is another huge plus if you`re into that kind of thing. Don`t come into this expecting the world to be saved by a ragtag bunch of juvenile heroes, the only thing you`ll find here are a bunch of people willing to shed blood if that`s what it takes to get a meal half off.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="371767">If not due to the weak development throughout, Ben-tou succeeds because at least the plot is original and the various stereotypes are pulled off pretty well. But that`s about where the weakness ends. The animation is on par, if not better than many other shows, and it as well as the style suit the show nicely. The fanservice is deliciously moderate compared to many modern shows; the break bentos are about the most fanservicey things in the show. But most of all, I want to laude the soundtrack: few anime shows have had as fitting a soundtrack in recent years. It breathes life and action through and through, making me actually look forward to the fights! The one thing I hope for is a sequel, as the end of the show is obviously not in sight.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="210496">Silly, good fun. The animators do not take themselves seriously, and you should accept it as such. Takes a while to grow on you, but it definitely will.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="112092">An original story (But don`t take this anime serious), go watch if your tired of watching the same generic anime over and over again, this will refresh you</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="503773">really funny 
quite the entertaining show to watch in order to recover after something deep</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="445819">Ignore all those who tried to take this seriously... like usual... this is a show that is meant to be taken at face value with no real deeper meaning.  It`s a fun series which pulls away from traditional ecchi/harem/fighter shows like Maken-ki and actually turns into something decent.  It was never meant to be groundbreaking, but Ben-tou actually turned out to be a lot of fun and is certainly a show I`ve looked forward to every week.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="499428">If you love the not to serious genres, with a twist of randomness, the watch this!, the idea is quite funny, and so far it looks promising, you need to be able to watch an anime without taking the plot to seriously, a great way to waste some time!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="78231">clearly the other `reviewers` of this anime are looking for the type of generic fighting anime that takes itself too seriously, burdened with a cast of dozens, an endless supply of ridiculous superpowers and some rambling, incoherent but of course TERRIBLY IMPORTANT backstory.

... Ben-Tou has none of these.  So go watch something terrible like Maji de Watashi ni Koi Shinasai, this season`s poster child for inane and incoherent fighting.

Ben-Tou is clearly a parody of the fighting high-school genre, in this case where the students have nothing more serious than saving a few dollars on the line.  All your stereotypes are here- and they all just want to have a half-price dinner.  The show is light-hearted and seems well-paced in the first few episodes so anyone calling it `unwatchable` or outright `bad` is clearly pretty shallow and full of themselves.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="481845">I wanna go to Japan and get a half-priced bentou for myself lol</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="371281">i see 3EP &amp;lt;_&amp;lt; i`m look at the others whobe very mean to these anime after only one EP =_=.
Ben-to is surprisingly good after all did you read the Plot Summary (pepoly fightfor half price food)

but these anime more thin that the fight is great and it not supernatural or marshal arts it mean fight by hungry peples.

the story good, about what kind of life you want be a DOG or a WOLF.

last word: BAD ASS ANIME</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="183015">Very funny story. Especially good if you sick from all these Ordinary Japaneze High School Students saving the world.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="52">Worthwhile and funny, makes me hungry.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="211996">Disregard the haters, I don`t know how any mentally-healthy person could watch this and not fully enjoy it! The show`s theme is completely absurd and 100% awesome, I`m amazed at how well they pulled it off. It`s a short show @ 12 episodes, so I`d recommend you spend a few hours and watch it all at once.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="339155">If your are looking for some comedy then this is a must, its so damn funny!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="623684">Been watching nothing but Anime for the past 3 weeks and this is by far one of the best i have seen.. It is a must see funny and great fights..</recommendation>

<description>* Based on a light novel series by http://anidb.net/cr28953 [Asaura], with illustrations by http://anidb.net/cr28952 [Shibano Kaito].
One day a poor freshman high school student named http://anidb.net/ch35127 [Satou You] discovers a bento (boxed meal) on sale at half price at the local supermarket. Reaching thoughtlessly to grab the new-found treasure, he ends up unconscious on the floor of the store a moment later. He soon finds out that getting a half-priced bento means taking part in a fierce, no-holds-barred supermarket survival battle. Despite being warned to stay out of it, he continues struggling to hold his ground until the Ice Witch, http://anidb.net/ch34209 [Yarizui Sen] — a second-year student and current president of the Half-priced Food Lovers club, invites him to join her club because she sees his remarkable strength. Finally You is able to compete with the other fighters, including his half-cousin http://anidb.net/ch34210 [Shaga Ayame].
Note: The first episode received a pre-airing limited to 2000 viewers on NicoNico Douga on October 4, 2011. Regular television broadcast started on October 9, 2011.</description>

<name>horny nosebleed</name>
<description>In Japanese media, healthy young men who have no other sexual outlet will often suffer nosebleeds upon seeing the naked female body, or even just a pair of well-filled panties.
The nosebleed is, of course, a visual shorthand/euphemism for sexual arousal. It is commonly interpreted that way for males and females, with little trickles of blood indicating mild arousal, and gushing fountains of blood indicating erection/extreme arousal in both sexes. It can also be interpreted as shorthand strictly for erections in males. In that case, when blood shoots from the nose explosively, and in ridiculous quantity, the implication would be an ejaculation.

<name>swimsuit</name>
<description>A swimsuit is one of several kinds of garments designed to be worn by people engaging in water-based activities or sports or during certain activities under sunlight. Most kinds of swimsuit reveal a large portion of the body surface area, but exceptions exist. The more revealing kinds may also be worn as undergarment in sports that require wetsuits, or when there is a need to display the body, as in the case of beauty pageants or bodybuilding contests.
There is a very wide range of styles of modern swimsuits, which vary in relation to body coverage and materials. The choice of style of swimsuit is dependent on current fashions, community standards of modesty, and plain personal preference. Swimsuits for men usually expose the chest, while those for women do not usually do so; however, many women prefer to engage in water or sun activities with their torso uncovered, in a practice commonly described as toplessness or topfreedom. Since the early twentieth century a naturist movement has developed in western countries that seeks a return to non-sexual nakedness when swimming and during other appropriate activities; in some places around the world, nude beaches have been set aside for people who choose to engage in normal beach activities in the nude, and such beaches may or may not enforce nudity onto their goers.
In anime, it is common for at least one episode to feature the characters in swimsuits, usually as an excuse for gratuitous fanservice; when that happens, the episode is usually labeled a pool or beach episode, after the place the characters went to. Swimsuits, and in particular one-piece swimsuits, are a very common fetish in Japan; while the reason for that is uncertain, a common folk explanation is the fact that boys throughout their entire adolescence are commonly exposed to their female classmates wearing them, in what might be called an experiment in sexual discovery waiting to happen.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>absurdist humour</name>
<description>Surreal humour, also known as absurdist humour, is a form of humour predicated on deliberate violations of causal reasoning, producing events and behaviours that are obviously illogical. Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, non-sequiturs, irrational or absurd situations, and expressions of nonsense.
The humour arises from a subversion of audience`s expectations, so that amusement is founded on unpredictability, separate from a logical analysis of the situation. Its appeal stems from the fact that the situation described is exceedingly ridiculous or unlikely.
On an analytical level, all jokes contain a certain amount of incongruity, but while regular jokes carry an incongruity that the audience accepts as compatible with expectations, absurd jokes are characterized by a disproportionate amount of it, with the punch line delivering a situation incompatible with the world as we know it and failing to resolve the matter in the audience`s eyes.

<description>Even though school clubs in Japan are not mandatory, there is some pressure from the social grid (e.g. fellow students, teachers) to participate in some kind of after-school activity, be it in sports or arts. Colleges also have clubs.
As a comedy element in anime, some students have joined too many clubs, and are thus constantly stressed out. There is also the element of social commentary, making it clear that you have to join a club, if you want to be part of the class. Since self-founded clubs need at least 3 members, the desperate search and advertising for new members can be cause for hilarity in anime.</description>

<name>large breasts</name>
<description>Large breasts are breasts a fair notch larger than average, as found in some adolescent girls or fully grown women; however, as anime has no upper limit to breast size, the definition applies somewhat differently. To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<description>Romance describes a story that deals with love between two or more characters typically also having an optimistic ending. Romance is also a difficulty encountered when creating a harem.</description>

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<description>Pretty much exclusive to hentai shows only unless an ecchi show has implied sex and/or a strong indicator of nudity. A character is considered a student if she goes to school, doesn`t matter if it`s high school, college or homeschooling, but she should be of appropriate age for a student; a housewife going to college should not get this category.</description>

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

<description>For some people it is just a card- or board game. For others it is not just a matter of life and death — it is much more important than that.
Serious business basically describes a situation, when a show revolves around an activity where a sizeable portion of the in-series population takes it far more seriously than it should. If something`s popularity rivals that of Elvis, or if there are mainstream schools devoted to it instead of teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic; it is serious business.</description>

<description>A racing driver that debuted in the original Virtua Fighter. He fights using Bruce Lee`s incredibly versatile Jeet Kune Do style, allowing him a few of Bruce Lee`s actual techniques that he chose to perfect during his lifetime. The most important aspect of Jacky`s game are his combos, which can be utilised to repeatedly strike and inflict massive damage. He also seems to have a brash and confident attitude.
The eldest son of the Bryant family, Jacky is Sarah`s older brother. He maintains his cool in every situation. Those on the Indy racing circuit call him the Blue Flash. Jacky was seriously injured in an accident in the 1990 Indianapolis 500, and spent two years in a gruelling rehabilitation program. Just when his injury had healed, he discovered the existence of the mystery group behind the accident. At the same time, his sister Sarah disappeared. Jacky`s battle began as he pursued the trail of the group who held the key to these mysteries.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A high school student from France that debuted in Virtua Fighter 2. He fights to gain independence from his father, and uses the style of Praying Mantis Kung Fu.
He is born into the Rafale family, one of the wealthiest families in France. They are involved in the aircraft industry. But this business is just a front for their involvement in illegal arms contracts with terrorists. Lion has been practising Praying Mantis Kung Fu under an instructor as part of management education since he was five. He resents his father`s control over his life and during one of their arguments, his father proposed that Lion must win the World Fighting Tournament as a prerequisite to become free from him.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A herbal doctor from China who made his debut in Virtua Fighter 2. He uses Drunken Kung Fu. Shun is from Northern China and is considered as a sage by many. He teaches in his small training hall and had many students in the past but most have left him by now. This is due to his keen interest in taking students able to take hardship as part of the training.
While drinking with his friends, Shun hears them boasting about the success of one of their student fighters in recent tournament competitions. He suddenly exclaims, "I also want to participate in the World Fighting Tournament". Shun`s friends pleaded with him not to, but once Shun had mentioned his intent to fight, he was adamant and eventually joined the tournament.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>An Australian Aboriginal fisherman and Pankration practitioner who made his debut in the original Virtua Fighter. The most skilful fisherman of his village, he has an engaging personality. He was bested by only one opponent - the giant, eight-meter long, man-eating "Satan Shark". They fought several battles, and finally met in their ultimate match. Jeffry was routed and his boat wrecked, but he somehow managed to recover as he hovered on the verge of death. He entered the World Fighting Tournament with a vow to build a new boat and do battle with the shark again.
After the third world tournament, Jeffry finally has some cash to build his boat. However, with the boat completed, Jeffry finds out that the "Satan Shark" has mysteriously disappeared. Unable to find the "Satan Shark", Jeffry starts asking the other fishermen the whereabouts of the "Satan Shark". He was then told the location of where the "Satan Shark" was seen last. However, even though he now had the location of the shark`s new hunting ground, he was still unable to find it. When he hears of the fourth world tournament, he decides to join in hope of winning the cash just so he can afford a sonar device to hunt for the shark.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The daughter of Lau Chan, she made her debut in the original Virtua Fighter. She is a martial arts action film star in her hometown, and her fighting style is Mizongyi. It is revealed that her favourite hobby is dancing.
Pai is a leading star in Hong Kong action films. Her moods change as quickly as a cat`s - she can erupt in passion in one minute, and turn icy cold in the next. Lau`s only daughter, Pai was specially trained by her father in martial arts from a young age. In the original Virtua Fighter, however, while Lau obsessively strove on with his training, Pai`s mother worked so hard to support the family that she died of overwork. Her death devastated Pai and she blamed it on Lau; she swore that one day she would beat him. Two years later, she was a success in the movie industry.
After failing to defeat her father several times, Pai eventually learns that Lau has become ill and seeks to find a successor to his school of martial arts. Pai`s goal to avenge her mother shifts and she becomes determined to defeat her father in order to gain his acknowledgement as a worthy successor and his daughter.</description>
