<description>Due to unforeseen circumstances, the production or release of this anime has been pushed back, stalled, or cancelled one or more times from when it was first announced.
While some of them have eventually been completed, others might have only had a trailer released or have been changed into another format (e.g. a TV series turned into an OVA).
Common reasons for a work to become stuck in development hell include creative differences, legal issues, financial problems, scheduling conflicts or the death of an involved creator.</description>

<description>Bean Bandit is one tough man. Perhaps "virtually unstoppable" is a better way to put it. To start, his clothes provide LOTS of protection. A kevlar-titanium combination line his jacket and headband, and both are able to stop bullets. He also has kevlar is his gloves, pants, and boots.
As you can imagine, Bean`s very strong. He`s strong enough to tangle with the best of them either with just his bare hands or with his knife, which he can pitch with incredible speed and power.</description>
