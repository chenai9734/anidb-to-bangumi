<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>space is an ocean</name>
<description>The difference between space and ocean is marginal. In fact the two are completely interchangeable. Spacecraft are usually called ships and space forces use naval ranks. Movement in space is two-dimensional. There is friction. And not to forget space pirates are roaming through the galaxy and just so often you will encounter space whales.
Some titles take this even a step further by actually displaying the space as a sort of gigantic liquid mass.</description>

<name>space opera</name>
<description>Space opera is a sub-genre of fiction that emphasizes romantic adventures in space. Space opera generally involves large-scale conflicts between opponents with powerful abilities and technology. The genre will often be melodramatic, sometimes playing music that can be nothing short of awesome. Warfare and a battle of wits are usually less emphasized, preferring romance (with exceptions, e.g. Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu). Some space operas tend to be formulaic and sometimes even prosaic, often employing very simple devices and somewhat obvious strategies. An example of this would be the infamous laws of physics in the Macross universe, in which the main male lead will hardly ever get hit in battle.</description>

<description>After the defeat of the Earth`s space fleet by the Gamilas Empire in the year 2199, the inhabitants of Earth secretly convert the ruins of the Japanese battleship Yamato into a massive spaceship, the Space Battleship Yamato. Using blueprints they attain from Queen Starsha of the planet Iscandar, they equip their new ship with a space warp drive, called the "wave motion engine", and a new, incredibly powerful weapon called the "wave motion gun" which fires from the bow.</description>

<summary>The Argo warps to Galmania, the headquarters of the Galman Empire, at the center of our galaxy. Upon arrival, they are greeted by Desslok and General Talan, now called "Masterson" (thanks to gross carelessness on the part of the translators of the Third Season). Desslok tells Wildstar and Nova the long story of how he came to found Galman in early 2202. 
"After leaving you when our battle against the Comet Empire (editor`s note: in reality, the Black Nebula Empire) was over, I found myself on a long journey. I could not forsee the end of the journey. I was a homeless wanderer..." 
Desslok`s Gamilon fleet searched for a new home and found two planets near the center of the Milky Way that resembled Gamilon and Iscandar. They learned that it was the Galmans who had initially colonized Gamilon. Thus, the Galmans were the ancestral race of the Gamilons. But the Galmans had been enslaved by the Bolar Federation. Desslok`s fleet soon freed Galmania and its sister planet. And, Desslok was soon proclaimed Emperor and God. He set about the task of ridding Earth`s side of the Milky Way of the Bolars. During the formative years of the Empire, Desslok came to realise that he had actually loved the dead Queen Starsha of Iscandar. In fact, he named the sister planet of Galmania "Starsha" in her honour. The aggressive strength of the Galman Empire begins to worry the Star Force, who fear that Desslok is up to his old game of militarism. For the moment, they keep this to themselves.

<summary>Desslok recognises his responsibility in Earth`s present predicament. It was, after all, Galman proton missiles which unintentionally fell into the sun, accellerating nuclear fusion. Desslok therefore insists on using the Galman`s scientific power to save the sun. Sandor, Homer, and Galman Technology Major Cranshaw depart for Earth in five Magnetic Field Generating Plant ships. Their mission is to enclose the sun in a magnetic field to screen out much of its deadly radiation. Then, by firing more proton missiles into the sun, they expect to restore the suns natural fusion reaction rate (as if more proton missiles could fix the problem). The launch is interrupted by a Bolar missile attack. Galman`s local defense system malfunctions, being sabotaged by peace-loving Guardiana worshippers, and a medium-sized missile hits near Desslok`s central palace (see inset). After the initial wave, a giant Bolar planet-destroyer missile is detected heading for Galman. To protect the Plant Ship launch, the Star Force takes off and destroys the missile with the Wave Motion Gun. Wildstar, uncomfortable at Desslok`s military build-up, warns Desslok that his reliance on weapons and aggression will be his downfall. 
Wildstar: Desslok, why not use it for peace? 
Desslok: Peace? I built them to maintain peace... Only through a war of peaceful conquest can we acheive peace in our time... 
Desslok: The Bolar sphere of influence is vast, and they have powerful weapons. This planet has been long coveted by the Bolars, and, well, I cannot let it fall into their hands again.

<summary>The Plant Ships arrive at Earth, and fail in their plan to restore the sun. Cranshaw, dishnoured by the failure, plummets his ship into the sun. The remaining Plant Ships return to Galmania in defeat. Just before the Star Force leaves Galmania to resume its search for a new planet Earth, Desslok informs them that he has spotted a planet that is very similar to Earth not very far from their present position. This planet is called "Phantom".

<summary>The Star Force resumes its quest for a new home for Earthers. Two months go by. In the Skalageck Star Cluster, the Star Force finds the wreckage of the Arizona. It had been attacked by Bolars. Both the Galmans and the Bolars learn that Mariposa is alive and on the Argo. Both dispatch fleets to retreive her. The Bolars want her dead. The Galmans want Mariposa so that she might lead them to Guardiana, which they believe posseses massive military might. Desslok orders his fleet, commanded by Admiral Gustav and already close to attacking the Star Force, to instead protect the Argo from the Bolars. After receiving this order, Gustav actually say -- in English -- "Shit! That`s unfair! I could have destroyed that lucky ship!" Well, Gustav, if it`s any consolation, at least you got to say "Shit!" on T.V. The Galman fleet is destroyed in the process, but the Argo succeeds in destroying the remaining Bolar fleet with the Wave Motion Gun. But, believing that their mission to find a new home for Earth has essentially failed, Wildstar agrees to take Mariposa home to Guardiana, provided that she lead the way.

<summary>The Star Force arrives at Guardiana, a planet which is hidden in a subspace pocket. But, they are followed by Desslok`s main fleet and the Bolar armada as well, thus exposing Guardiana`s secret location. The Star Force learns that the planet is utterly peaceful, and tells Desslok that it poses no threat to anyone. Desslok agrees to leave the planet alone, but must first fight off the Bolars who have followed him there. He attempts to "put an end to Bolar incursions once and for all" by using his Hyper Desslok Gun (Excelsior). It wipes out a huge chunk of the Bolar armada. After the battle, Queen Mariposa shows the Star Force executive staff the hidden arsenal of super weapons that Guardianans have put away -- never to be used again. Mariposa undergoes a metamorphosis and melds with the spirit of Queen Guardiana. She gives the Star Force a HydroCosmoGen Cannon which can restore the sun to its normal state. The Star Force beats a fast path home.

<summary>The Star Force returns to Earth to fix the sun. Before they can, they are attacked one last time by a Bolar fleet and space fortress. Desslok and his fleet of huge Desslok-gun ships arrive to destroy the Bolar fleet. But the fortress is impregnable, and destroys most of Desslok`s fleet with its artificial black hole guns. Flash Contrail crashes his AstroFighter into the gun, disabling it. Desslok`s ship, equipped with an extra-powerful Desslok Cannon, is then able to destroy the fortress. The Star Force goes on to shoot the sun with the HydroCosmoGen gun, restoring its fusion reaction rate to safe levels. Wilstar bids Desslok and the apparition of Queen Mariposa/Guardiana goodbye and returns to Earth. Mariposa fades into the sky with the body of Flash Contrail.
