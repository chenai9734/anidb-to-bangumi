<description>Misumi Rin is the head of the disciplinary committee, who dislikes http://anidb.net/ch75361 [Ui]`s love campaign. She`s somewhat hostile towards http://anidb.net/ch75357 [Hayato] as well, but later on she develops feelings for him after he treats her nicely and helps her on various occasions.
She explains that she joined the committee because she wanted to disclaim a rumor that she was seducing guys with her large chest by emphasizing her morally pure side.
