<description>Morning comes and the village is holding a festival. Dangobei, a kagura performer invited from a village called Tanokyu appears. He entertains the villagers with masks of a plump-faced woman and a comically distorted male face. Before long, the festival ends. Dangobei receives money and leaves for home. Going by night sends Dangobei down the wrong path, and he wanders into the Kuragari-toge Pass. In Tanokyu, his mother worries about him. A giant snake appears in front of Dangobei who is frightened by the dark path. Dangobei quickly puts on a kagura mask. The giant snake asks him his name. He says "Dangobei of Tanokyu" and pleads for his life. However, the snake thinks he said raccoon dog (because Tanokyu sounds like tanuki). When the giant snake asks him to turn himself into something, Dangobei puts on each of the kagura masks, and so the giant snake excuses him. Feeling relieved, Dangobei goes to light a cigarette, but the giant snake says he hates nicotine. The giant snake asks what Dangobei dislikes. He says he hates "money" as it is a source of alienation between parents, children, and siblings. After running for his life to return to the village, he tells the villagers about the giant snake. Then, the villagers go to kill the giant snake. The giant snake dies from all the nicotine and angrily throws lots of koban (oval gold coins formerly used in Japan) at Dangobei.

<name>elements</name>
<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>comedy</name>
<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>short movie</name>
<description>Typically used when an OVA only has one part and is less than the usual 20 to 25 minutes in length.
So instead of calling it a `short episode`, the `short movie` tag is more appropriate.</description>
