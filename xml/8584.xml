<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="177640">The story doesn`t make any sense, they really screw up the second half of the show and don`t bother to give a satisfactory ending. The scenes in the BRS world and the fighting squences are good though, since there are only eight episodes, it isn`t too much painful to bear.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="440386">I really did not like the overall story. It felt to myself that I had to have a large amount of back knowledge to fully understand the series. I don`t need spoon feeding the information but a bit more than the drip feed that I got in this series. For fans only</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="584375">awesome visuals and interesting story</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="533215">awkard story but the fighting scenes  and the colours were awesome!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="261826">Ok! first of all I`m a fan of the series bec. I`m doing some BRS artworks and the designs of the char. is surely amazing, but that`s not about the anime...

Negative: Too much emotional characters, they`ve overdoing it in this series oh my god!, I hate that part specially Yomi`s character part, though I liked her new design for the series XD...

Positive: Eye candy action scenes, this is where the series stand out, this series probably do have the best fight scenes in this year`s anime lineup.

Overall: Recommended if you can tolerate the emotional characters, and looking for some eye-candy battle scenes, and also recommended if you`re a fan of the BRS artworks</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="538957">Great and eye-catchy animation, it has not bad plot ideas but there`s some annoying girlish character development with epic BOOM-BAM battles. Eight episodes,however,are not such a pain.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="457039">It`s really surprising to see such a low rating and other negative comments.

Firstly the story is not your daily normal shounen one. It requires your full attention and you will need to watch it until the end to fully understand it. You might even need it to watch it again. Complain as many be `cause they can`t understand, but this is one of the rare masterpiece stories you will ever come across. 

And about those who say about overly emo girls, well this is about them and that`s how it is in real life. This is not just for entertainment but rather a real influential story.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="248240">an unusual anime, well and nice looking animations. I love it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="100678">Whereas the first offering felt like a stylized visual powerhouse that left you asking questions and asking for more, this one spoon-feeds you the answers. The action is still dripping with style, but they could have cut the episodes in half and left some things up to your imagination. Still a good watch. Underrated here IMO.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="372851">This anime was not as good as expected but it was still good.
The good thing about this anime is that has a good feeling to it</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="102269">it`s a must see for those who want to check their human side - whether they have become heartless and have given up on living the life in full color or they can remember the times of pain, endure them and step over. 

And it`s of the most visually appealing anime I have seen - ever! That other world is a masterpiece! and its contrast is even more underlined by rather simplistically drawn real world. Art department alone could have made this anime into masterpiece, but thanks god it wasn`t only an eye candy but also something to warm up your soul. Recommended!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="201320">A work of art that uses multiple visual styles to create one fantastic story. The characters explode with emotions and the plot is dark. A must see!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="194735">These ratings confused me at first. Then I realized that the average anime viewer is used to being spoonfed an explanation of the fantasy elements of every show in the first episode. Just watch the show, and make sure your ability to Think and other low level brain functions are activated, if you have that capability. This show is not THAT  complex, it shouldn`t be confusing. If there was an anime equivalent of James Joyce, then I would say you have a right to be confused by that, but come on guys, this show is very simple and shouldn`t be confusing unless you only watch Shounen.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="300879">Good TV Series overall, great Animation, nice soundtrack, opening song by Hatsune Miku, nice voice acting. Story confusing (not really) but with good plot, have to watch it till the end where everything gets cleared so don’t give up halfway.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="394403">extremely unusual plot. after the fourth episode i felt i was finally understand wtf was happening only to have that blown to smithereens in the next episode... we shall see how this plays out in the last 3 eps</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="307450">Angst , Despair , fights. What you need more.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="269300">Starts slowly, and i mean really slow, but after watching a few eps, i finished watching them all in one go.
There are many stories about love and pain, but this one surely is exceptional among them all.
The fighting scenes are actually not that important, the story itself is great enough to entertain me to its fullest.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="524477">Why must see ? Because I can`t explain why i like it from the first seconds and opening song to last second of last episode. It`s simply interesting story, great animation and a bit of something unexplainable.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on a media franchise that started with characters created by illustrator http://anidb.net/cr9407 [Fuke "Huke" Ryouhei] and already inspired http://anidb.net/s50284 [a song of the same name] by http://anidb.net/cr8766 [Ryo], an http://anidb.net/a6820 [original video anime], figures, and games.
This is not the world you know. There roams a girl with jet-black hair, ebony clothes, and a strikingly blue, glowing eye. Her name is http://anidb.net/ch11472 [Black Rock Shooter]. With a huge cannon in hand, she throws herself into a fierce battle...
Meanwhile, in another world, middle school student http://anidb.net/ch16058 [Kuroi Mato] is drawn to http://anidb.net/ch16057 [Takanashi Yomi], her classmate with an unusual family name. Mato does her best to talk to Yomi, who just will not open up. http://anidb.net/ch19406 [Koutari Yuu] belittles her best friend Mato`s efforts but at the same time, supports her. Mato also finds herself surrounded by other colourful characters at school, like the eccentric school counsellor, http://anidb.net/ch39700 [Irino Saya], and the hot-blooded captain of her club, http://anidb.net/ch39699 [Kohata Arata].
Suddenly, one day, the window of opportunity opens. After Mato sees that Yomi has her beloved picture book, "Li`l Birds at Play", they strike up a conversation and Mato is invited to come over to Yomi`s house. There, they gradually get acquainted, until a girl in a wheelchair appears. This is Yomi`s best friend, http://anidb.net/ch39698 [Izuriha Kagari]...
Two worlds. Mato and Black Rock Shooter. This is the story of their agony.

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>sword</name>
<description>A sword is a long, edged piece of metal, used as a cutting, thrusting, and clubbing weapon in many civilizations throughout the world. Before firearms became commonplace, and fast enough to render other weapons pointless in the battlefield, they were the main kind of weapon for war and duels alike. A sword fundamentally consists of a blade and a hilt, typically with one or two edges for striking and cutting, and a point for thrusting. That aside, however, they may come in all sorts of designs: the medieval European swords used to be big, heavy weapons that did not actually cut but instead broke the enemy`s bones under their armor; conversely, the Chinese jian sword (called "ken" in Japanese) attempted to exploit the armor`s joints and perforate the enemy`s flesh in those places, but was useless against the armor itself, and did not take the strikes, preferring to redirect them, to this day being considered a highly "circular" weapon and associated to taijiquan; on the other hand, the Japanese katana was a balanced all-purposes weapon that could be used even in an axe-like way, but which a master swordsman could use in many other, more elaborate manners.</description>

<name>content indicators</name>
<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

Examples are the women in VanDread, AIKa or the most famous incarnation of that tag, the Strike Witches and their precursor the Sky Girls.</description>

<description>Asia is Earth`s largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometers, about 30% of Earth`s total land area and 8.7% of the Earth`s total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

<name>parallel world</name>
<description>A parallel world, parallel universe, or alternative reality is a self-contained separate reality coexisting with our own. Because "alternative reality" sometimes implies that the reality is a variant of our own, like for example a mirror world, we use the term "parallel world/universe" which is more general, without any connotations implying a relationship (or lack thereof) with our own world/universe (meaning a fictional world can just as well have an alternative reality, it doesn`t need to be our reality). To put it more simply, this category is to show if more than 1 world/universe/reality is present in the anime.
Multiple timelines of the same world/universe/reality are NOT considered parallel worlds. For example, in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate] the cast travels through multiple "World Lines", which are defined as parallel timelines of the same universe had various events occurred with differing outcomes.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<description>noitaminA (ノイタミナ) – Animation written backwards – is a Fuji Television programming block, devoted to anime, broadcast each Thursday night from 00:45 to 1:15. It was launched with the intention of expanding the target audience beyond the typical young male demographic.
The timeslot was expanded from half an hour to a full hour in 2010, and now airs Thursday nights from 00:45 to 1:45.
noitaminA aired its first non-anime series in 2010, with the premiere of the live-action adaptation of Moyashimon. On April 15, 2010, Fuji TV and FUNimation announced an agreement that allows FUNimation to simulcast series from the noitaminA block in North America within an hour of their airing in Japan.</description>

<description>A common device for a series opening or Establishing Character Moment. Things begin in a frantic rush which usually results in taking short cuts, such as eating breakfast on the run. The classic image is of someone running down the street with a slice of toast hanging out of their mouth, dragging their backpack with one hand while trying to put on their jacket or sweater one-handed with the other, bumping into important people in a manner that gets the plot started.
Basically, they`re never on time for school. While some are Heavy Sleepers, it would appear that they may have simply set their alarm clocks so as to give them insufficient time to get to class.

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

<description>This genre of anime is typically set in both the world as we know it (reality) and a world of dreams, mythology or imagination.
Sometimes this dreamworld is actually real, sometimes it is not. Other times what we think is the real world is the dreamworld, and vice versa. They are not always easy to distinguish from each other, neither by the characters nor the viewer.
