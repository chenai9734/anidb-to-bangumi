<description>In pursuit of a high school student he admired, http://anidb.net/ch73934 [Hoshitani Yuuta] enrolled in the musical department of the prestigious music school Ayanagi Academy. He successfully completed the year-long enrollment test and, in his second year, finally became a student of the musical department... but a new trial awaited him right from the start of the new year!
First on the curriculum for second-year students is to act as support in the commemorative graduation performance put on by http://anidb.net/ch73939 [Ootori] and the other graduates. The traditional program, Shadow &amp; Lights, includes five roles created specifically for training second-years, so each year a team of five second-years has a chance to participate. It`s a very coveted role among students of the musical department, as well as a chance to perform alongside the former leaders they admire.
Hoshitani and the rest of the 25 new students in the musical department are about to enter the audition for these second-year training roles, with their ticket to glory on the line!

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<summary>After being told by Ageha that they are not the same Hoshitani suddenly feels down wondering why they would be so different. The members of Team Hiragi point out that it`s most likely because Hoshitani lacks a few things that many of the rest of them possess. Meanwhile, Tengenji invites his teammates and classmates to a performance of one of his family`s Gothic Kabuki shows and come to realize he is not all talk when it comes to his professional status. The show reignites the fire in the young men to take on the training role auditions with renewed vigor.

<summary>While practices for the training roles are underway with guidance from the Ancients, Hoshitani spends his days receiving strict special guidance from Uozumi due to his lack of acting skills. To lighten things up a bit, Tatsumi and Sawatari suggest going to the middle school`s drama club performance for a change of scenery. The joyous mood of the event is threatened when one of the performers in the play drops out due to illness. When Sawatari suddenly recommends Hoshitani as the replacement he worries about his lack of skills but with the encouragement of his friends he steps out on stage. Will the show be a success?

<summary>The competition for the five second year training roles in the much-anticipated school musical "Shadow &amp; Lights" is set to begin. This time, however, the boys are being mentored by former alumni who know the musical better than anyone. These experienced graduates are known as the Ancients and include former members of the Kao Council from Tsukigami Kaito`s older brother`s generation. Hoshitani and the others are ready to take on the challenge but one student, Ageha Riku of Team Yuzuriha, will stop at nothing to follow in the footsteps of his idol, Tsukigami Haruto. A new set of trials begin as each boy longs to stand in the spotlight alongside their admired mentors.

<summary>Kaito has found himself in a slump going up against Ageha, who is copying his older brother 
Haruto`s performance. Noticing this, Uozumi pulls Kaito and Hoshitani aside and suggests that they switch the roles that they are going to be auditioning for. This obviously upsets Kaito, who took on the most difficult role for both his team and for himself, and he is unable to be swayed. This situation sends a wave of dissonance throughout all the teams as the boys struggle to find their motivations for the upcoming auditions. Will they be able to overcome their anxiety?
