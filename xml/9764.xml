<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>RPG</name>
<description>Any anime that is based on a role-playing game aka RPG. A role-playing video game is a video game which includes elements of non-electronic role-playing games. The player assumes control of one or several fictional characters (a party) who have joined forces in order to perform quests and overcome a great number of challenges and enemies, usually monsters inspired by fantasy, and, to a lesser extent, science fiction and classic mythology. During the course of the game the characters, or avatars, which are generally defined by quantized characteristics, evolve and improve in that their various attributes increase, as well as by gaining more powerful artefacts.</description>

<name>episodic</name>
<description>An episodic anime consists of many successive short arcs that are generally 1-2 episodes in length, with strong plot continuity within each arc but generally little continuity from one arc to the next. For long shows (well upwards of 50 episodes), the episode count constraint is less tight; for example, a show with close to 250 episodes would also be considered episodic if it consisted of a majority of arcs of up to 3 or maybe 4 episodes and possibly also very few slightly longer arcs.</description>

<description>Caterpie known as the Worm Pokémon, are larval Pokémon found in the wild early in the Kanto and Johto regions. In main series Pokémon games set in these regions, Caterpie are among the earliest and easiest Pokémon species caught by players, as they are very weak. They can be evolved into their cocoon-like Metapod form and eventually into the butterfly-like Butterfree form. Caterpie in the wild employ biological adaptations to survive, much like real caterpillars, in that their green bodies are useful for camouflage in foliage, their eyes are patterned to scare away predators, their suction-cup feet allow them to climb any surface, and the osmeterium on their heads can project a horrid stench to repel predators. It bears a resemblance to the spicebush swallowtail caterpillar.
In the anime, Caterpie as the first Pokémon Ash ever caught in his trainer career, and it eventually evolved into a Butterfree and was later traded for a Raticate on the S.S. Saint Anne but is traded back later in the episode. Ash releases it later so it could mate with a pink Butterfree.</description>

<description>Metapod known as the Cocoon Pokémon, are pupal Pokémon found in the wild early in the Kanto and Johto regions, of which its larval form is the caterpillar-like Caterpie. In main series Pokémon games set in these regions, Metapod are among the earliest and easiest Pokémon species acquired by players, either by catching one in the wild or training a Caterpie past experience level 7 and evolving it into a Metapod. They can evolve into the butterfly-like Butterfree when raised past experience level 10. A Metapod`s exterior is regularly hardened to protect its soft and tender innards while undergoing metamorphosis to eventually become a Butterfree. To conserve energy for this event, the Metapod barely moves.</description>

<name>Butterfree</name>
<gender>dimorphic</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Butterfree is a dual-type Bug/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Metapod starting at level 10. It is the final form of Caterpie. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Butterfree resembles a vaguely anthropomorphic butterfly with a purple body. Unlike true insects, it only has two body segments and four light blue legs. The upper pair of legs resembles small, three-fingered hands, while the lower pair resembles long, digit-less feet. Butterfree has two black antennae, a light blue snout with two fangs underneath, and large, red compound eyes. Its two pairs of wings are white with black venation. Two oval scales on a female Butterfree`s lower wings are black, but they are white on a male.
As Gigantamax Butterfree, its size increases to gigantic length with altered look. The wings and its pattern changes to light and dark green color with white. The antennae change to bright green and extends to the point where the tip bends, and three red clouds surround it. The eyes changes to bright glowing red. A fur-like circle is attached to both the wings and back of Butterfree. Several green scales can be seen floating around Butterfree, which are its most effective weapons, capable of releasing paralysis, poisoning, or sleep. The massive wings are powerful enough to lift a 10-ton truck through a simple flap. The wind it generates can scatter poisonous scales throughout the area, making it dangerous to be near it.
Butterfree`s wings are covered with poisonous powders that fall off continuously as it flies. It will defend Caterpie from bird Pokémon using this powder. This powder also repels water, enabling it to gather honey even in the rain. Butterfree will roam up to six miles (ten kilometers) from its nest in search of honey, which it carries with the hairs of its legs. Sometimes it has territorial disputes with Cutiefly over fields of flowers. It also consumes sap from trees pierced by Heracross, as seen in the anime. Butterfree is found in temperate forests and jungles, but it has also been observed flying near the ocean as part of its migratory breeding pattern.
Gigantamax Butterfree is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Befuddle.</description>

<description>Kakuna, known as the Cocoon Pokémon, are pupal Pokémon found in the wild early in the Kanto and Johto regions, of which its larval form is the worm-like Weedle. In main series Pokémon games set in these regions, Kakuna are among the earliest and easiest Pokémon species acquired by players, either by catching one in the wild or training a Weedle past experience level 7 and evolving it into a Kakuna. They can evolve into the hornet-like Beedrill when raised past experience level 10. Within the shell, a Kakuna busily prepares itself for evolution into its adult form, and the amount of energy released by this process makes the shell quite hot to the touch. In the wild, Kakuna are often found near or on trees, and because their range of motion is extremely limited, they may be mistaken for dead. Carelessly approaching a Kakuna in this state would be extremely unwise because it can still extend the barb of its poisonous stinger to protect itself from threats.</description>

<description>Beedrill, known as the Poison Bee Pokémon, are fully-developed, hornet-like Pokémon that have hatched from their pupal Kakuna forms. In main series Pokémon games, Beedrill are only acquired by training a Kakuna past experience level 10 and evolving it into a Beedrill; whereas many other Pokémon evolve into their final forms at much later levels, Beedrill`s early availability makes it a temporarily strong asset to Pokémon Trainers starting out on their journeys. Beedrill are extremely territorial, and will be set off by anything that approaches a Beedrill nest. When angered, Beedrill attack in a furious swarm, and the sharp ends of their stingers and the poison stored in their abdomens will definitely be put to use.</description>

<description>Pidgey, known as the Tiny Bird Pokémon, is a bird-like Pokémon, whose original name in the English beta version of Pokémon Red and Blue was "Pidge". Pidgey was first introduced in the United States in Red and Blue. They are one of the first wild Pokémon that players encounter in those games. Pidgey does not like to fight, and will use its wings to stir up clouds of sand in an attempt to distract its would-be opponent and escape. Pidgey also uses this technique to bring its preferred prey of small insects into the open. Pidgey seems to possess magnetoception, as it is capable of returning to its nest from any location without fail.
Pidgey also appeared in the first television episode, Pokémon, I Choose You!, when the main character, Ash Ketchum, attempts to catch one. He fails when it uses its Gust attack to blow him away and escapes. Afterwards, it uses its Sand Attack to blind Ash, allowing it to get away.</description>

<description>Rattata, known as the Mouse Pokémon, are a basic Pokémon species found very commonly in the wild in the Kanto and Johto regions of the Pokémon world. Rattata are among the earliest Pokémon that can be caught by players, so much so that it is said that the presence of one Rattata indicates the presence of more than forty Rattata in the area. They make their nests almost anywhere and as extreme omnivores eat anything they can scavenge. A Rattata`s fangs grow continuously throughout its lifespan, so it whittles them down to a comfortable size by gnawing on hard objects.</description>

Male Nidoran are classified as a separate species of Pokémon from the females due to differences in appearance between genders, such as the female being light blue and having smaller horns than the male. It should be noted that these were the first Pokémon to have known genders until the release of Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Silver, although they remain as separate species to this date. This Pokémon protects itself with its venomous barbs.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Nidoking are a fully grown and developed species of male possum-like Pokémon and the final stage in the male Nidoran evolutionary line. Its horn is hard enough to pierce a diamond and contains secreted venom, making it a powerful stabbing tool upon prey and Pokémon battle opponents. Nidoking have immense upper-body strength, being able to snap a telephone pole like it were a twig. It uses its tail to smash down its target, then constrict it to break its bones. Its thick tail packs enormously destructive power capable of toppling a metal transmission tower.
As several Pokémon seem to have been designed to resemble other aspects of Japanese pop culture and mythology, it is interesting to note that Nidoking bears a resemblance to Baragon, a monster that has appeared in the Godzilla movie series.
In the main Pokémon game series, a Nidoking can only be acquired when a Moon Stone item is applied to a Nidorino so that the creature is evolved into a Nidoking. They are the masculine equivalent to Nidoqueen. Also, they are more primal, fighting other Nidoking for such matters as territory or food. (Or a Nidoqueen, in mating season.)</description>

<description>Vulpix is a fox-like creature with six curled tails, based on the Japanese fox spirit kitsune. Most commonly female, Vulpix are especially known for being beautiful. As Vulpix undergo Pokemon evolution, their red fur turns pale yellow and they grow three extra tails. Vulpix usually have a friendly, if not spoiled, temperament. Because of the flame in their bodies, when the temperature outside increases, they let flames out of their mouths to prevent their body temperature from getting too hot. In the wild, Vulpix will feign injury to escape from more powerful predators.
During the first season of the Pokemon anime, Vulpix appears often as one of Brock`s Pokemon. It was given to him by a girl named Susie who felt she could not take care of it well. Brock, who felt he was only "babysitting", gives it back to Susie in the season four episode called "Beauty and the Breeder".
Its Japanese name, Rokon is a portmanteau of six (六, roku) and kon (from kon kon, an onomatopoeic word describing the bark of a fox), or an alternate reading of the Japanese word for kitsune (狐, kitsune), meaning fox - in this case, the reading is ko (こ). Its English name may have been derived from the scientific name for a group of foxes, Vulpes.</description>

<description>Ninetales is a yellow nine-tailed fox, based on the kitsune, a Japanese fox spirit. Ninetales is highly intelligent and able to understand human speech, but also vengeful; Ninetales have been recorded as putting a 1,000 year curse on anyone who grabs one of their tails, which is a focus of the plot in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team. They, along with Vulpix, have keen senses of smell, hearing, and sight. It can only be obtained by using a Fire Stone on a Vulpix. Its Japanese name Kyuukon comes from a combination of the Japanese number 9, kyu, and the sound of a barking fox.
In the anime, Ash and the gang find an abandoned mansion and Brock is deceived by a Ninetales, whose master strongly resembles Brock.
Since it has nine tails, the Pokemon`s name is very commonly misspelled as "Ninetails." Even the Game Boy Color port of the Pokemon Trading Card game uses this misspelling.</description>

<description>Wigglytuff is a relatively large pink balloon-like Pokemon with a white underbelly, large blue baby-like eyes, a pair of large rabbit ears, and a twisty tuft of pink hair on its forehead. It evolves from Jigglypuff through a Moon Stone. In fact, it`s remarkably similar to its pre-evolved form, Jigglypuff, except the ears have grown larger and it now maintains an "oval" shape. Wigglytuff`s eyes are always covered by a thin layer of tears, so that if any dust gets into Wigglytuff`s eyes, it is quickly cried away. In the games, Wigglytuff`s fur is described to be "sublime", so much so that if two of them come into close contact with each other, they are difficult to separate. In the television series, Wigglytuff is generally accepted as the most powerful Pokemon.</description>

<description>Diglett is a basic mole-like creature that can be found only in Diglett`s Cave. Capable of burrowing at the speed of sound, it thrives in dark underground caves since exposure to bright light can weaken it. The burrow and excretions left by a Diglett, rather like those of a real-life earthworm, keep the soil aerated and fertile. For this reason, Diglett are prized by farmers.
The mysterious feet or hands of Diglett are unknown of what they look like, for the fact that Diglett can use moves such as slash and fury swipes. Only the head of a Diglett can be seen popping out of the ground.</description>

<description>Meowth is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves into Persian starting at level 28. It also has a Gigantamax form.
In Alola, Meowth has a Dark-type regional form. It normally evolves into Alolan Persian when leveled up with high friendship. However, in Pokémon: Let`s Go, Pikachu! and Let`s Go, Eevee!, it instead evolves into Alolan Persian starting at level 28.
In Galar, Meowth has a Steel-type regional form. It evolves into Perrserker starting at level 28.
Meowth is a small, feline Pokémon with cream-colored fur that turns brown at the tips of its hind paws and tail. Its ovoid head features four prominent whiskers, wide eyes with slit pupils, two pointed teeth in the upper jaw, and a gold koban coin embedded in its forehead. Its ears are black with brown interiors and are flanked with an additional pair of long whiskers. Meowth is a quadruped with the ability to walk on its hind legs; while the games always depict Meowth on two legs, the anime states that Meowth normally walks on all fours. It can freely manipulate its claws, retracting them when it wants to move silently. The tip of its tail curls tightly.
Meowth is attracted to round and shiny objects and has the unique ability to produce coins using Pay Day. Being nocturnal, it is known to wander about city streets at night and pick up anything that sparkles, including loose change. Upon finding a sparkling object, its eyes will glitter and the coin on its forehead will shine brightly. It shares this intrigue with Murkrow, with whom it often fights with for objects and prey. Meowth is a playful but fickle Pokémon with the capacity for human-like intelligence. At least one member of the species teaching itself how to speak. Meowth tends to live in urban areas.
Meowth was introduced to Alola as a gift to royalty. The luxurious royal lifestyle soon led to Meowth diverging from its origins and becoming the selfish, prideful, and cunning Alolan Meowth. Alolan Meowth will turn hysterical if its coin or pride are besmirched. When the monarchy fell, the rare Alolan Meowth went feral and eventually grew as common in Alola as anywhere else. Alolan Meowth`s fur is a light blue-gray color. Instead of brown markings, the tip of its tail, whiskers, digits, and the insides of its ears a whitish-gray. Alolan Meowth`s whiskers have a slight curve compared to regular Meowth`s straighter whiskers, and it has silvery eyes.
Galarian Meowth has a shaggy, greyish-brown coat resembling a beard, as well as yellow eyes and a toothy grin. Its coin is now black and extremely hard, with the hardest coins being especially valued. Galarian Meowth`s body has partially turned to iron as a result of many years of living with a race of savage seafarers.
As Gigantamax Meowth, it has become larger and longer in size. The body extends from lower half to the shoulder, while the gold coin gains a symbol. Meowth`s eyes change to a glowing gold color. The tail grows long as well, with the end of it tips extending. Three red clouds surround it below the shoulders. The giant coin emits a lot of Gigantamax power that surrounds the area with a golden gleam. Its desire for shiny objects increases to the point where it will cause damage to skyscraper windows and exterior walls for the sake of sharpening its claws.
Gigantamax Meowth is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Gold Rush.</description>

<description>Growlithe`s name is derived from the words growl, because it growls at its enemies, and lithe, which refers to its readily bent posture before it attacks. It is harder to catch in Pokemon because of one of its attacks that allows it to flee. Its name in the beta version was Flamie. This cute puppy Pokemon makes its home in active volcanoes, grassy plains, and scorched plains heated by geothermal energy. Growlithe is Naturally loyal and protective of its trainer. If trained correctly it will remain motionless until it is given an order by its Trainer, though if it is improperly trained, or mistreated it will bite without warning or unprovoked. In the wild Growlithe will bark fiercely at anything that dares to invade its territory. Don`t let its puppy like appearance fool you it will fearlessly stand up to opponents bigger and stronger than it. Growlithe also has a superb sense of smell. Once it smells anything, this Pokemon won`t forget the scent, no matter what. It can even use its sense of smell to determine the emotions of other living things.</description>

<description>Victreebel is a carnivorous Pokémon based on the pitcher plant. It lulls its prey with a sweet, honey-like scent, and also the vine on its head (which waves as if it were an animal) before digesting it with powerful stomach acids that can even dissolve bone. Normally, its prey are bugs, but it has been known to attack and consume small animals. Victreebel cannot be caught in the wild in any of the Pokémon video games; it must be evolved from Weepinbell with a Leaf Stone.
In the anime, James of Team Rocket had a Weepinbell which evolved into Victreebel in the episode "The Breeding Center Secret." As a running gag, it usually tried to eat him as soon as it emerged from its Poké Ball (this tradition of James`s Grass-type Pokémon hurting him was continued by Cacnea in the Advanced Generation series, and Carnivine in the Diamond and Pearl series). While most Pokèmon speak in a vocabulary consisting of its own name, Victreebel, like Lapras, communicates through loud, high-pitched shrieks.</description>

Ponyta is an equine Pokémon with cream-colored fur. It has brown eyes and triangular ears with reddish interiors. Yellow and reddish-orange flames form its mane and tail. The mane forms a short crest on top of its head and a short strip down its back to its tail. Additional flames are present behind its elbows and knees. The fire appears about an hour after hatching. It has four long legs, each ending in a single, gray hoof. These hooves are said to be harder than diamonds.
Ponyta has extraordinary jumping abilities and is capable of leaping tall buildings in a single bound. However, a newborn Ponyta is a weak runner and is actually barely able to stand. It gradually strengthens its legs and becomes faster by chasing after its parents. In the anime, it is shown that Ponyta can control its flames so that its rider is not burned by them. Ponyta live in grasslands, on plains, or anywhere that it can run freely.
In the Galar region, Ponyta has adapted to forests by being exposed to the life energy from it. It has chalk-white fur; long, purple-and-blue, cloudy fur that is also on top of its dark-purple hooves; purple eyes with light-blue irises; and a purple-and-white horn on top of its forehead. Galarian Ponyta can absorb the life energy located in the atmosphere and store it in its mane, which will then become more colorful and potentially release a shining glow if there is a lot of energy to use. The small horn contains a healing power. Ponyta can heal any slight wounds with a few rubs from its horn. By looking it the eyes of a person, it can read the contents of the heart. Should Ponyta find any evil, it will promptly go back into hiding.</description>

<description>Slowpoke is a dual-type Water/Psychic Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves into Slowbro starting at level 37 or Slowking when traded holding a King`s Rock.
In Galar, Slowpoke has a pure Psychic-type regional form, introduced in Pokémon Sword and Shield`s 1.1.0 patch. It will evolve into Galarian Slowbro using an item found on the Isle of Armor or Galarian Slowking using an item found in the Crown Tundra.
Slowpoke is a pink Pokémon that resembles a cross between a salamander and a hippopotamus. It has vacant eyes that never seem focused, curled ears, and a rounded, tan muzzle. It has four legs, each of which ends in a single white claw. Its long, tapering tail has a white tip. This tail drips a sweet, sappy substance that is attractive to many species of fish. Slowpoke uses the tail as a fishing lure. The tail often breaks off, but it will grow back. In Alola, its tail is often dried and used in home cooked stews.
Slowpoke has notoriously dim intellect, and often forgets what it was doing. It takes a long time to respond to outside stimuli. For example, it can take up to five seconds to process pain and can take an entire day to notice when its tail has been bitten. Slowpoke is commonly found at the water`s edge. In some places, it is believed that Slowpoke`s yawn causes rain. This Pokémon is worshiped in those areas.
In Galar, Slowpoke gains yellow markings on its forehead and tail.</description>

<description>Slowbro is a slow and dopey Pokémon that evolves from Slowpoke. Its name a portmanteau of slow (as in "slow-witted") and bro (as in "brother", probably relating to the fraternal relationship it shares with the Shellder on its tail). Slowpoke becomes Slowbro when a Shellder clamps down on its tail, yet it is so slow and dopey it is sometimes unaware of the change until it gets out of the water. Its Japanese name is most likely derived from 宿借り yadokari (hermit crab). The Shellder which bites on its tail sucks on the aforementioned syrup, and so it is hard to remove. Also toxins which leak from the bite pass into Slowbro, which numbs its immunity to pain even more. The relationship between Slowpoke and Shellder is symbiotic; being attached to the Slowpoke enables the Shellder to travel on land, whereas the weight of the Shellder on its tail enables the Slowpoke to walk on its hind legs, freeing the use of its arms.</description>

<description>Doduo resembles an ostrich or a roadrunner, with sharper beaks and an extra head. It may also be based on the kiwi. Its name is a portmanteau of the words dodo, the extinct flightless bird, and duo, in reference to its two heads. Doduo`s tracks are huge and very distinctive. It inhabits and races across grass-covered plains at 60 mph. It is well-adapted to dry and arid climates. Doduo`s second head is said to have been formed by a sudden mutation thousands of years ago. Both heads normally contain identical brains, although rare cases have been observed where a Doduo has two distinctly different brains.
Interestingly, Doduo can be caught in the wild in all of the Pokémon video games. Doduo can also be found in Pokémon Snap.
In the Pokémon anime episode "Bad to the Bone," Jessie of Team Rocket battles a Doduo with her Arbok. The battle is interrupted when the Doduo`s heads begin to fight with each other.</description>

<description>Gengar is a dual-type Ghost/Poison Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Haunter when traded. It is the final form of Gastly. It can Mega Evolve into Mega Gengar using the Gengarite. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Gengar is a dark purple, bipedal Pokémon with a roundish body. It has red eyes, a wide mouth that is usually curled into a sinister grin, and pointed ears. On its back are numerous spikes and it has smaller spikes on top of its head similar to tufty fur. Its arms and legs are short with three digits on both its hands and feet. It also has a stubby tail.
Gengar has the ability to hide perfectly in the shadow of any object, granting it exceptional stealth. However, Gengar`s body acts as a heat sink. Its presence cools the temperature of the surrounding area by nearly 10°F (5°C), because it absorbs the warmth. The anime has shown that Gengar can fly and possess people and other Pokémon. In the past, Night Shade was its signature move.
Gengar is very mischievous, and at times, malicious. It enjoys playing practical jokes and casting curses, such as pretending to be one`s shadow, then behaving erratically. When the quarry notices, the Gengar takes delight in its victim`s terror. However, Gengar has been known to be loyal to a Trainer who treats it well. Being the result of an evolution via trading, Gengar is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in caves and dark places where shadows form. It is especially fond of urban areas such as cities and back alleys, but only during the night.
As Mega Gengar, a portion of its body sinks into the ground and its arms and tail lengthen. The lower portions turn a more reddish purple, and a third eye appears on its forehead. This new unblinking eye is oval, yellow, and allows it to see into other dimensions. The spikes on Mega Gengar`s back are more numerous and pointed and additional spikes appear on its hands and tail. Its ears are now considerably longer and tilt backward.
Mega Gengar has the ability to access other dimensions and has a vicious nature. Mega Gengar has no itnerests in opponents unless perceived as prey. Its relationships are warped due to Mega Evolution. It now desires to take the life and curse anyone or anything in its path It may even curse its own Trainer. Mega Gengar sinks into an another dimension to wait for a chance to attack.
As Gigantamax Genger, it becomes larger with portions of its body sinking into ground. Only the head, tail, and arms remain. Also it changes to from a dark purple to lighter purple. The eyes change to the color white with yellow sclera. The inside of the mouth changes to resemble a tunnel with a long purple tounge sticking out. Three red clouds surrounds the top of Gengar’s head.
There’s a rumor where Gigantamax Gengar’s mouth does not lead into its body. Due the cursed energy, it’s believed to instead lead into the afterlife. By laying a trap, it hope to steal the lives of those it captures. Should someone stand near its mouth, they can hear the voices of their loved ones calling out to them.
Gigantamax Gengar is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Terror.</description>

<description>Krabby is a crab with large pincers. Krabby is an omnivore and a scavenger; it rarely hunts for itself. It can also act as a filter feeder by digesting the bacteria in sand, but this is rare. It is territorial, and in beaches where there is little food, fights between Krabby are common. Krabby also uses camouflage; it can form mucus sacs about itself if threatened, making it seem larger or making it harder to spot against sea sand. It is usually very small, but it makes up by its aggressiveness.
Krabby first appeared at a beach in episode 13, Mystery At The Lighthouse, when Ash Ketchum wanted to prove that he could catch a Pokémon alone. After the capture (which involved Krabby attacking Ash`s finger), it was automatically transferred to Professor Oak`s lab, because Ash already had six Pokémon with him. To Ash`s great surprise, Gary had also caught another Krabby, which was much larger than his. Ash used Krabby in his first battle at the Indigo Tournament. Krabby won against an Exeggutor and evolved into Kingler, despite the fact that Krabby had never battled before.</description>

<description>Exeggutor`s name is believed to be derived from the name of its previous evolutionary stage (Exeggcute), whose name is derived from egg and the word execute so Exeggutor`s name is a combination of egg and executor. The Japanese name is derived from the words ココナッツ kokonattsu (coconuts) and 椰子 yashi (palm tree). A large Coconut Tree like Pokémon with three independent thinking heads. The heads are considered fruit or nuts and each has a different expression on its face similar to Exeggcute. When an Exeggcute evolves into Exeggutor, any and all cracks and breaks are mended as they turn yellow and combine to form the new Exeggutor. Living in a good environment will allow it to grow lots of heads, and it is said that they occasionally fall off to form new Exeggcute.</description>

<description>Magikarp is a commonly found Pokémon that can survive in rivers, lakes,and oceans. Despite its adaptability, the Pokédex states that the Magikarp species has grown weaker over time, and it is one of the least viable for battling in the series. It eventually evolves into another, far more powerful Pokémon, Gyarados.
Magikarp is commonly thought of as the weakest Pokémon. They are only able to learn three moves: Splash (does absolutely nothing), Tackle (a weak attack), and Flail (which does more damage as Magikarp is more damaged.)
In the anime, Magikarp has appeared several times, most notably as the subject of a running gag in which a salesman attempts to trick Team Rocket into buying Magikarp in various guises. (This man also appears in Pokémon Red, Blue, Yellow, FireRed, and LeafGreen.) Team Rocket later adopted a Magikarp-shaped submarine.
Magikarp also appear many times in the video games. They can be found in almost any pond, river, lake, or sea. Many trainers have them, along with other weak Water Pokémon like Goldeen or Horsea. In Pokémon Pearl, one trainer named "Ander," found outside Lake Valor, possesses a Magikarp whose move "Quake" replaces the normal Magikarp`s equally useless "Splash".</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Gyarados is the evolved form of Magikarp. It is a dramatically large change from Magikarp, going from a small fish to a long draconic, serpentine body. Gyarados tend to be very aggressive, and are powerful enough to destroy entire cities. They have a reputation for appearing where there is conflict, and shrivelling everything up with the Hyper Beam attack. Rampages like this have been known to last upwards of an entire month, and will not end until everything around them has been destroyed. Because they have been known to sink ships as well through the seastorms their rage causes, they are considered legendary among sailors, especially the red/ golden variety. Its big change in behavior is said to be attributed to a structural change occurring in its brain while evolving from Magikarp.
In the beta version of Pokémon Red and Green, Gyarados had the name of Skullkraken.
Shiny Gyarados is a particularly rare variety of Gyarados. While Gyarados are normally blue in color, there are some rare red/ gold scaled Gyarados. Though no more powerful than their more common blue counterparts, red Gyarados are valued for their rarity and individuality. This is caused in Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal and the anime by a radio frequency transmitted by Team Rocket to force the Magikarp to evolve. The red coloration comes from the Magikarp evolving prematurely, and not undergoing the conversion from red to blue scale pigment. Thus, they retain the same color they had as a Magikarp. Red Gyarados are more commonly called Shiny Gyarados, or even Golden Gyarados due to the contrasting coloration.
In Generation II Pokémon games, a red Gyarados at the Lake of Rage is a main part of the plot. After its defeat or capture, a Red Scale is obtained, which can be given to Mr. Pokémon, or Marcus Spanier, in exchange for an Exp. Share. The red Gyarados is the only Pokémon in the Generation II games that will be shiny without fail.
In the anime, one is owned by Misty. At first, she fearfully dislikes Gyarados due to a traumatic experience, but manages to get over the fear, take over the Cerulean City Gym, and add one to her team. The red Gyarados in the anime is caught by Lance, the dragon trainer, to rescue it from Team Rocket. Team Rocket also uses a Gyarados-shaped submarine in early episodes, but trades it for a Magikarp-shaped submarine in later episodes.
Gyarados was noticeably larger in the Indigo Series, but has since become a lot smaller. Gyarados` most powerful attack is said to be Dragon Rage (however, this is not true in the games, given that Dragon Rage only ever does 40 damage), where many other Gyarados appear around the main Gyarados, then they start spinning around at such a speed they became one huge tornado, as seen in Episode #18: Island of The Giant Pokémon.</description>

<description>Lapras is a dual-type Water/Ice Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, it has a Gigantamax form.
Lapras is a large sea Pokémon that resembles a plesiosaur. It has a blue hide with darker blue spots and a cream-colored underside. It has large brown eyes, a short horn on its forehead, and tightly curled ears. It has a long neck and four flippers. The foremost flippers are larger than the hind. On its back is a heavy, gray shell covered in blunt knobs.
Lapras is a gentle, helpful Pokémon that enjoys ferrying people across bodies of water. In the past, its docility made it an easy target for hunters, and it was driven to near-extinction. Recent protection efforts have seen Lapras become overabundant instead, which is now affecting the fish Pokémon numbers in some areas. An intelligent Pokémon, it is able to understand human speech. Lapras have been known to travel in large pods across the seas, spanning both polar and tropical areas. To keep in touch with other of its kind, it sings enchanting melodies. In the anime it was shown that Lapras is able to develop psychic abilities such as telepathy.
As Gigantamax Lapras, it becomes larger in size and more armored. Its shell resembles a cruise ship with four gray and red stripes surrounding it, and it has four spikes on top of its shell with one steel spike resembling a funnel, which has three red clouds surrounding it. The sclera in Lapras` eyes change colors to white, yellow, and blue. A light blue ring of fine thin lines resembling a musical sheet created from ice particles circles around its shell.
5,000 people can ride on the shell of Gigantamax Lapras for a very comfortable ride without any issues. Lapras can use it giant ring to break any icebergs that may prevent it from swimming.

<description>Eevee is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves into one of eight different Pokémon through various methods. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Eevee is the game mascot and starter Pokémon in Pokémon: Let`s Go, Eevee!, as well as for the main characters of Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness and Pokémon Conquest. It is also the rival`s starter Pokémon in Pokémon Yellow, although Professor Oak originally intended to give it to the player.
Eevee is a mammalian, quadruped Pokémon with primarily brown fur. The tip of its bushy tail and its large furry collar are cream-colored. It has short, slender legs with three small toes and a pink paw pad on each foot. Eevee has brown eyes, long pointed ears with dark brown interiors, and a small black nose. Eevee is rarely found in the wild and is mostly only found in cities and towns. However, Eevee is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure that is easily influenced by its environment. This allows it to adapt to a variety of habitats by evolving. Eevee is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Extreme Evoboost.
In Pokémon: Let`s Go, Eevee!, the player starts with a special Eevee known as a Partner Eevee. The Partner Eevee has purple eyes and a lighter shade of fur. These design elements likely taken from the anime, which implemented similar traits starting in the Advanced Generation series. The marking on the tip of a female Partner Eevee is heart-shaped. Before Pokémon Sword and Shield, this trait was unique and wasn`t found on other female Eevee. Partner Eevee has higher base stats and access to moves that normal Eevee do not. Partner Eevee is the only Pokémon capable of performing Bouncy Bubble, Buzzy Buzz, Sizzly Slide, Glitzy Glow, Baddy Bad, Sappy Seed, Freezy Frost, Sparkly Swirl, and the Partner Power, Veevee Volley. In Pokémon Sword and Shield, the unique pattern is present on all female Eevee as a true gender difference.
As Gigantamax Eevee, it has become larger and more fluffy. The fur collar becomes longer with several triangular furs pointing straight up. The right ear has three red clouds surrounding it like a circle. Due to the fur becoming fluffier and luxurious, any enemies caught in it will lose the will to fight due to being enamored by its presence. Due to Gigantamaxing, Eevee becomes even more playful and rambunctious, desiring to play with its opponent and often unintentionally crushing them with its size.

<description>Vaporeon is one of the evolutions of Eevee that is caused by radiation from a water stone. Upon evolving, it gains fins and gills that give it the ability to live underwater. It has small scales that are hard to see. Its finned tail is similar to a mermaid`s, so it is often mistaken for one. Vaporeon`s cells are similar in structure to water molecules, and this allows it to have a unique control over the water around it. This includes being able to transform itself into liquid as a form of camouflage (this being portrayed in the games as its ability to learn the attack Acid Armor), and detect rain through subtle vibrations in its fins. Its base scale color is aqua with darker aqua that makes a line along the spine from the tail to the neck where it forms into a base for its white frill. A darker-aqua patch on the head is similar in shape to a diving cap, and upon the head are three yellow fins, two resembling ears, and the middle one, a Dorsal fin. Its ability is `Water Absorb`, which allows it to gain HP when struck with a water type move.</description>

<description>Jolteon is one of the evolutions of Eevee that is caused by radiation from a thunder stone. Jolteon is covered with spiky, bright yellow fur, with white spiky fur surrounding its neck. Its fur sparks with electricity constantly; it can be soft to the touch or turn into sharp needles that can be fired when it is angered. Jolteon is able to gather negative ions from the atmosphere, using the resulting electricity to create lightning bolts of up to 10,000 volts. Its individual cells also create small electrical charges on their own, which combined with the static electricity caused by its body can result in powerful electric-type attacks. It`s very sensitive which causes it to constantly charge as it quickly changes moods. It can also make lightning and cause small thunderstorms. In the Pokémon video games, Jolteon can absorb electric attacks and turn them into HP (Health Point, or Health) with the ability `Volt Absorb`.</description>

It stores thermal energy from the sun, causing its body temperature to skyrocket to more than a range of 1600 degrees Celsius, releasing its flames from an internal sack. Its ability is `Flash Fire` which negates fire-type moves against it and increases its attack by 1.5 times damage if hit by a damaging fire attack.</description>

<description>Dragonite is the final form of the Dratini evolutionary line. It evolves from Dragonair at level 55. Dragonite`s appearance is notably different from that of its previous forms. As Dragonite, it is now a golden bipedal dragon with a beige underbelly that extends from the top of its neck to the tip of its tail. Along with already being a Dragon-type, it has now gained the secondary Flying-type, growing wings. Dragonite is one of the fastest flying Pokémon, and "The fastest flying Pokémon" as of the first generation. It has a small horn on the top of its head, along with slightly "S" shaped antennae. However, much like its previous forms, Dragonite still has a gentle and somewhat innocent appearance. Its diet consists mainly of berries, soft plants, and fruit, while it will occasionally eat crustaceans, like Corphish and Krabby.
Dragonite are very loyal to any trainer they find worthy of acceptance. They are calm, gentle, and intelligent creatures, but when threatened can put their pudgy bulk to good use. Dragonite seem to have more advanced vocal abilities compared to other Pokémon in that they make several different types of calls, rather than just saying their name. They have been noted to save drowning swimmers and threatened sailors. Dragonites` speed is very varied; some Dragonite can have great speeds while other have very low/average speeds. It is said that Dragonite can circle the globe in less than 16 hours.
Dragonite`s main anime appearance was at the end of the Orange Island League season in "Enter The Dragonite". It was spotted twice in the previous episode "Hello Pummelo" as Ash, Tracy and Misty saw it flying over the sea around Pummelo Island and they learned that it was owned by the "Orange Crew" leader, Drake. It also defeated Team Rocket as they tried to steal Dragonite. In Ash`s six on six battle with Drake, it defeated Ash`s Charizard with Dragon Rage, Squirtle with Thunder and Tauros with Thunder before Ash`s Pikachu took it out with a Thunder of its own. While none of Ash`s Pokémon were strong enough to defeat Dragonite on their own, their combined attacks steadily weakened it to the point of exhaustion, allowing Pikachu to finally defeat it. Drake keeps Dragonite`s Poké Ball on a necklace. Professor Oak also owns a Dragonite and was used prior to the episode "The Mastermind of Mirage Pokémon". It also appeared in Pokémon: The First Movie, when it was sent by Mewtwo to give Ash and his friends an invitation. It also appeared in the beginning of Ash`s journey when he encountered Bill. Here, Dragonite was described as an unknown legendary Pokémon by the Pokédex, and because it was nighttime the colour of its skin couldn`t be seen.</description>

<description>Croconaw is the evolution of Totodile. It opens its huge jaws wide when attacking. If it loses any fangs while biting, new ones will quickly grow back in its place so that it always has 48 fangs. The tips of these fangs are slanted backward. Once Croconaw has clamped its jaws on its foe, it will absolutely not let go. Because the tips of its fangs are forked back like barbed fishhooks, they become impossible to remove when they have sunk in. This means that the prey has no hope of escape. The pattern on Croconaw`s belly vaguely resembles a jungle tunic or loincloth. Croconaw live in or around swamps. When they evolve into Feraligatr, they move into an area where there is a waterfall.</description>

Hoothoot are also known for having precise senses of time, due to a special mechanism in their brain that measures the rotation of the earth. Properly trained, they can be more accurate than all but the most precise of clocks. In nature, they always begin hooting at the same time every night.</description>

Ampharos has powerful light abilities, its main light sources being the large orbs on its tail and head, and because of this is often used as a beacon in lighthouses, and mythical legend says that these lights can even be seen from outer space. Before the introduction of modern technology, Ampharos` light was used to communicate between long distances, in much a similar way to smoke signals.</description>

<description>Bellossom is a diurnal plant Pokémon. It evolves from Gloom if exposed to a Sun Stone. Bellossom`s petals can rotate, and they usually do when it is absorbing sunlight. The color of their leaves vary from a sickly brown and gray to a fluorescent yellow and red, depending on how much sunlight it has absorbed in the past few hours. When its petals are moving, either due to rotating or dancing, they rub together to make relaxing, bell-like sounds. The petals on its head also create a sweet scent.
It is also noted that a Bellossom will be even more beautiful if it was an especially rancid Gloom. The worse it smells as a Gloom, the prettier its petals will be as a Bellossom. Although naturally a peaceful and friendly Pokémon, it can be very territorial and violent fights can break out if there is an intruder or a challenger. Despite this, it is very social in areas outside of its self-determined territory, and the most common time to find a group of Bellossom together is when they all meet in one location to dance. It is said that these dances summon the sun.
Its Japanese name, "Kireihana", translates to "Beautiful" (kirei) and "Flower" (hana).</description>

The white bubble-like pattern on its lower stomach helps it to camouflage itself from potential predators when it is in the water.
Azumarill`s long ears act as sensors to identify sounds even in fast running rivers. Otherwise, when alone, Azumarill plays in water as a natural pastime, though it must roll up its elongated ears to prevent the sensitive sensory materials inside them from getting wet. The ball at the end of its tail can act as a sensor and guide it while under water. It can make thick, liquid balloons out of thin air with the saliva-water stored in its body. If it spots a drowning Pokémon in any body of water, it fashions such air balloons and jumps in to give the troubled Pokémon air balloons to help it breathe.
In the Pokémon anime, Paul owned an Azumarill which he used in a gym battle against Roark. Although it knew powerful Water attacks like Hydro Pump, it lost to Roark`s Geodude, which prompted Paul to give it to a Pokémon trainer passing by, being disappointed by its strength.</description>

<description>Wooper are similar to Axolotl. They are light teal-colored Pokémon with round feet, no arms, and a long tail. Their simplistic face consists of mainly of a large mouth, primarily while open. They have purplish barbed antennae on the sides of their head. Three purple, though sometimes shaded blue or pink, gills are on its stomach. Wooper will usually live in cold water: however, they occasionally come out onto land in search of food. When doing so, they coat their bodies with slimy, poisonous film. Touching the slime with bare hands will cause a shooting pain. Male Wooper have two barbs on their antennae, while female Wooper have one barb. Males also have larger gills.</description>

<description>Dunsparce is a land snake based on the tsuchinoko, a legendary snake-like cryptid from Japan. It has a yellow hourglass shaped body, two tiny wings on its sides, a drill for a tail, and two spikes under its chin. Its underbelly is blue, as well as the markings on its back. Dunsparce lives in caves and deep underground in nests of complex design. Its rudimentary wings enable it to hover just above the ground, providing it with an alternate method of motion besides crawling. Despite these wings and bug-like appearance, Dunsparce is solely a normal type Pokémon.</description>

<description>Ursaring is a large (although arboreal) bear with a yellow ring on its stomach. Ursaring eats food obtained from digging deep underground as well as berries from trees. Ursaring can hibernate through an entire winter without any food. Ursaring`s sense of smell is among the most developed of all Pokémon; it can detect subtle differences in scents. For this reason, Ursaring is sometimes used by police in the Pokémon universe, both as a strong enforcer, and as an explosive-sniffing Pokémon. If criminals are hiding in trees, it can use its claws to cut down the tree.
Its Japanese name, "Ringuma", originates from "ring" (ringu) and "bear" (kuma). In the anime, Ursaring is caught by Paul, after it is angered by Turtwig.</description>

<description>Remoraid is a Remora-based suckerfish that scavenges for food and has a somewhat symbiotic relationship with Mantine. Remoraid will attach itself to the underbelly of Mantine with its dorsal fin, eating scraps of food that Mantine drops as well as the parasites on them that causes them to itch. In return, the Mantine helps defend the Remoraid from enemies. When not scavenging for food, Remoraid will strike down its own prey with precise accuracy using fast streams of airborne water, which Remoraid shoots from its mouth using abdominal muscles. Remoraid can move faster through the water by blasting water from its mouth in the opposite direction of where it intends to move.</description>

<description>Octillery resembles a combination of an octopus and a tank. This is reflected in its abilities, including squirting ink as a means of self-defense. Also, like octopuses, Octillery can move about by squirting pressurized water from its mouth. Octillery is a carnivore; they catch fish with their tentacles, and kill (and afterwards eat) it by smashing the rocky protrusions on its head into its opponent`s skull. Octillery is a nesting creature, in that it sleeps in burrows it prepares; however, its nests are temporary structures only, and it rarely uses the same nest two nights in a row.</description>

Skarmory raises its offspring in bramble bushes, the thorny environment causing the offspring`s bodies to become more resistant. Skarmory`s wings become battered from repeated battles, so it grows the feathers back to the original state once a year. Feathers from Skarmory have been used by people of the past as knives and swords. It is based on the Stymphalian birds of Greek mythology.</description>

<description>Lotad is both an aquatic and a land-dwelling Pokémon, found in the Hoenn region, with a lilypad growing on its back. This species lives in groups at ponds, with their bodies submerged while suspended at the surface by their buoyant leaves, as a measure of hiding from predators. When on dry land, Lotad scuttles towards other ponds because its leaf is too heavy to support, in contrast to Lotad`s ancient ancestors which were one primarily land-dwelling Pokémon. Lotad and its evolved forms have mouths resembling duck bills, which may be a pun on the duckweed.
In the Pokémon anime, a Lotad becomes one of the Pokémon in trainer Brock`s possession in the third-generation Hoenn story arc in a development considered ironic because previously Brock primarily used Pokémon of the Rock and Ground types. His Lotad eventually evolved into Lombre, and then Ludicolo.</description>

It is a mysterious entity in the Pokémon world said to arrive by the chilly winds of Winter, and it is said to be a fearsome guardian of the deep forests it holds sway over from its homes on the tops of toweringly tall trees in dark forests. Its hand fans, which are larger on males than on females, are capable of whipping 100-mph gusts of wind, and it possesses a degree of Extra-sensory perception, able to read its foe`s mind and take preemptive actions most other Pokemon would be unable to do in time. Nuzleaf is a generally strong pokemon but doesnt learn any "good" attacks until it reaches a generally high level.</description>

It migrates to other lands in search of warmth, flying over 180 miles a day on some occasions. It will courageously stand their ground against foes, taking on Pokémon like Skarmory with an equal footing. This gutsy Pokémon will remain defiant even after a loss. This however is in stark contrast to when it becomes hungry; it cries loudly. As a result of its relative youth, it sometimes becomes lonely and cries at night. It feeds on Wurmple that live in forests.
In the Pokémon anime, main trainer Ash Ketchum caught one and used it throughout the third-generation story arc, during which it evolved into a Swellow.</description>

Gardevoir has psychic powers including telekinesis and telepathy, and it also has the ability of precognition, enabling it to see into the future to detect incoming dangers. It moves by levitating itself, and can ignore gravity. Its powers are strong enough to the point where Gardevoir can disrupt the space-time continuum. By doing so, it can create a miniature black hole. Gardevoir has an unparalleled sense of concern for its Pokémon trainer, such that it will even give its own life for its trainer. The psychic powers that Gardevoir wields are at its height when it is protecting its trainer from a threat. In Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire and Pokémon Emerald, Wally uses a Gardevoir in the final battle in Victory Road.
Gardevoir also appears as a major character in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team.</description>

Though extremely lazy, a Slaking`s body contains a great amount of pent-up energy, and if it must battle an opponent it can potentially exert devastating power. In fields where these Pokémon have been, large bare patches appear in the grass. This is from were it reaches out and pulls up and eats all of the grass in its vicinity. When it has all been eaten, it reluctantly moves to another spot.</description>

This large, imposing purple creature has a body and vocal cords that are specifically constructed to emit noises and sounds of any decibel level, high or low. The holes seen all over its body actually serve a dual-purpose; They can violently inhale air, signifying that Exploud is about to let loose a huge bellow loud enough that it can be heard from over six miles away and strong enough to trigger earthquakes. Exploud employs this as its offensive measure against opponents in battle. The holes themselves can emit sounds as well. The sound-generating organs hidden at the base of each tubular hole can be adjusted by Exploud for tone and volume, and whenever Exploud lets loose a bellow, the noise is amplified by these organs. When communicating with other Pokémon such as other Exploud, it emits slighter whistle-like sounds from its sound tubes instead of its normal voice.</description>

<description>Rayquaza is one of a trio of legendary Pokémon, alongside Kyogre and Groudon, that represents Pokémon Emerald and appears on its cover art. In the legend surrounding the three, Rayquaza represents the sky, while Kyogre and Groudon represent the sea and the land, respectively. Rayquaza resides within the ozone layer of the Earth and has lived there for hundreds of millions of years without ever descending. To those who have observed Rayquaza from the surface of the planet, Rayquaza has always appeared to be a zooming meteor. Rayquaza feeds on water and particles in the Earth`s atmosphere. It is said to only descend from the ozone layer if Kyogre and Groudon were to fight, in order to end the feud and maintain the balance of nature.
In Pokémon Emerald, Rayquaza is seen in a series of cutscenes. Once the player progresses past the Magma and Aqua Hideouts, Kyogre and Groudon wake up and start fighting, with the Red and Blue Orbs unable to control them. It is eventually sought out at the Sky Pillar, and eventually forces the two to cease their battle. Rayquaza appears as a boss character in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games, where the main team has to fight it in order to have it annihilate a falling star hurtling towards the planet.
Rayquaza is featured in the seventh Pokémon movie, Destiny Deoxys. Four years prior to the main events of the movie, Rayquaza is nearly injured in the ozone layer by the passage of a meteor containing the essence of Deoxys. Rayquaza seemingly destroys the Deoxys afterwards, but it is eventually revived. Rayquaza goes after it again, but after being rescued by it, Rayquaza decides that it isn`t an enemy, and returns to the atmosphere.</description>

<description>Jirachi a legendary Pokémon that first appeared in the Nintendo games Pokémon Ruby and Pokémon Sapphire. It possesses telepathic and telekinetic abilities, including the ability to levitate. Jirachi hibernates for periods of one thousand years in a crystalline cocoon. If it is ever in danger, it will fight its attacker, but not awaken from its slumber. After one thousand years have elapsed, Jirachi awakens from its sleep for one week if it is sung to in a pure voice. During this period, it is able to make wishes. If a message is inscribed onto one of the "tags" on Jirachi`s head, it will fulfill those wishes. After it fulfills the wishes, Jirachi returns to hibernation in a newly-formed cocoon, waiting another thousand years for its next master`s wish.
Jirachi is one of the primary characters of the 6th Pokémon Movie, Jirachi Wishmaker. Tomiko Suzuki, in her final role, portrayed the character in the original Japanese version. Jirachi awakens for seven days, awaiting a wish to be granted. It soon befriends Max, and travels with him until it is used to create an evil being in the form of a Groudon. It absorbs the power used to create the beast, and returns to sleep.
While Jirachi was still in its slumber, it reached out to Max. Max became fast friends with Jirachi after it awakened, and helped it break free from Butler`s machine, which was used so that Butler could awaken Groudon with the use of the Jirachi`s powers. Jirachi awakens only once every thousand years, and Max was really sad when it went back to its slumber.</description>

<description>Dusknoir, known as the Gripper Pokémon, is the evolution of Dusclops, obtained by trading a Dusclops that is holding a Reaper Cloth. It appears only in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. Dusknoir`s body is mostly black, with four almond shaped eye-like markings (two in the front, two in the back) and a yellow horizontal zigzag line below the "eyes" along which the entire torso can open and close like a mouth, giving the impression of a face. This "face" also glows brightly when Dusknoir powers up for attacks. Dusknoir now has developed arms. Two yellow bands are near its wrists and its grey hands are similar to Dusclops`. Dusknoir has a grey, cylinder-shaped head with another yellow band near the top and a single black eye with a yellow iris and a red pupil. On top of its head is a yellow antenna which allows this Pokémon to receive transmissions from the spirit world, from where it receives commands to take people there; due to the presence of an actual "spirit world" in the games ruled by the Legendary Pokémon Giratina, a ghastly dragon that represents death, it is speculated that it is Giratina that gives orders to Dusknoir. In addition, it may have ties to the Grim Reaper, as the player needs a Reaper Cloth in order for it to evolve as well as it being a Gripper Pokemon, a possible portmanteau of "Grim" and "Reaper" altered to fit Dusknoir`s grabbing persona. Dusknoir has a ghostly tail instead of feet like Dusclops, resembling the stereotypical depiction of a genie. Its name can be translated as "black dusk", "noir" meaning "black" in French.
A male Dusknoir appears in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness as the main villain of the game. He is a tyrant from the future world and deceives everyone into trusting him and outing Grovyle as a villain, but in fact, he is an agent of Primal Dialga</description>

<description>Rotom, known as the Plasma Pokémon, is a small, floating Pokémon whose body consists of plasma, which can infiltrate electronic devices. They are mischievous, and wreak havoc on electrical appliances just for the fun of it. Pokémon Platinum introduced five new forms of Rotom: Frost Rotom, Wash Rotom, Mow Rotom, Fan Rotom, and Heat Rotom. Each form`s appearance corresponds to a household appliance (a refrigerator, a washing machine, a lawn mower, a desk fan, and an oven, respectively). In the Pokémon universe, researchers are looking into Rotom as the power source of a unique motor.
Rotom are shaped like lightning rods, while the blue aura of electricity around them takes the appearance of lightning. Rotom`s eyes and aura of electricity change colors when it changes form. Rotom`s looks and abilities were inspired by Pulseman, a game that GameFreak worked on before Pokémon. Rotom is the word motor backwards; this may refer to the fact that motors make many appliances function, while Rotom makes them fail.
The only available Rotom in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl resides in a possessed television in an old haunted château. You can only catch him after 8:00 PM but before 4:00 AM. In North America, Toys R Us gave out Secret Keys, which unlocked Rotom`s forms, via Mystery Gift from April 20, 2009 to May 12, 2009. The alternate forms of Rotom may also be accessed in Silph Co. in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver. In the anime, Rotom made its debut appearance in Get Your Rotom Running! in all its different forms, toying around with Ash and friends. In Pokémon Adventures, Rotom appeared in the television at the Old Chateau.</description>

<name>Sakaki</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Sakaki is the head of Team Rocket, and formerly served as the Gym Leader of Viridian City`s Gym, known officially as the Viridian Gym. He handed out the Earth Badge to Trainers who defeated him. As a Gym Leader, he specialized in Ground-type Pokémon, but his master plan includes collecting rare Pokémon of all types.
Very little is known about his past in any timeline; he is generally shrouded in mystery. However, certain things are known:
His mother was the head of Team Rocket before him. However, this is presumed to be canon in the anime timeline only, as the games have no precedent for this.
While Sakaki very rarely takes the role of antagonist, his agents often have him in mind during missions due to the chance of power, be it through promotion or other means. This gave him a unique series of appearances, mainly during the Hoenn saga, where Nyarth often saw how the Pokémon in each episode could be used to help Sakaki and win the trio promotions. These boss fantasies never show his actual personality and occasionally even show Sakaki in chibi form.
The only time Sakaki has been seen in battle was in The Battle for the Badge. He used powerful Pokémon against Shigeru but later left the Gym to deal with an unexplained emergency, leaving Satoshi to battle Musashi. By the time Satoshi returned from Hoenn, Agatha was in charge of the Gym until a new leader could be found. Sakaki`s reasons for leaving it have not been explained, though it is speculated to be linked with the events of the aforementioned episode.
Sakaki is one of the three most prominent figures speculated to be Satoshi`s father, alongside Professor Okido and Silver. There is no evidence to support this, though Diamondshippers see Sakaki`s avoidance of Satoshi mentioned above as suspicious. In Pokémon Live!, it was claimed that Sakaki and Delia had shared a relationship as teenagers, though it is also stated that someone else is Satoshi`s father in that particular canon.</description>

<description>Jessie is one half of of the Team Rocket duo that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokemon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
Jessie`s mother, Miyamoto, was a high-ranking Team Rocket agent. When Jessie was around the age of three, Miyamoto left on a mission to the Andes Mountains to record the voice of the elusive Pokemon Mew. However, Miyamoto disappeared, and Jessie was put into a foster home which had very little money. There were times when she had no choice but to eat snow because of a lack of more nourishing food.
When she was old enough, she left home to become a Pokemon nurse in Jouto. However, the school she was enrolled in was literally for Pokemon nurses (i.e. Chansey), so she failed to graduate and left, leaving behind a Chansey she had befriended there. It is assumed that she then traveled back to Kanto, where she enrolled in Pokemon Tech, a trainer`s school, met James, and subsequently failed and dropped out. After this, Jessie and James joined a bicycle gang in Sunny Town, where Jessie was known for swinging a chain above her head as she rode her bike (nicknamed "Chainer Jess").
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between Jessie and James after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Sometime before joining Team Rocket, and it is not known when, Jessie obtained a Contest Pass in the Hoenn region. Also during the years before Team Rocket, she had several boyfriends, all of whom left her and/or treated her badly. In "Xatu the Future", she revealed that she had once worked at a T.V. station as the Weathergirl. In "From Cradle to Save" is also revealed that she once was a ninja.
She has a long-standing bitter rivalry with Cassidy, another member of Team Rocket. Another member, Wendy, held a grudge against Jessie for failing to pay for a drink (making Wendy pay), but got her revenge when she added the charge to Jessie`s overall Team Rocket bill.
In the episode "Ignorance is Blissey", Jessie was reunited with her friend Chansey from the Pokemon nurse school; Chansey had since evolved into a Blissey.
Starting in Hoenn, Jessie has become a Pokemon Coordinator, entering every contest that she could. She frequently makes it to the battle round, but usually loses there. However, in "Borrowing on Bad Faith", she finally succeeded in winning an (unofficial) contest by using Ash`s Aipom, which she had saved earlier in the episode. And, in "Team Shocker!", she finally wins an official contest with her Dustox in at Solaceon City. Later she also won a ribbon with help of her Yanmega. She has Contest Passes to compete in the Hoenn, Kanto, and Sinnoh regions.
While Jessie`s role in the Pokemon anime has not yet ended, in Toshihiro Ono`s manga, "The Electric Tale of Pikachu", she ended up married to James and with child.
Jessie seems to have a special preference for snake-like Pokemon, owning both an Arbok and a Seviper. In "The Ninja Poke Showdown", she expressed a preference for Poison-type Pokemon in general.
For unknown reasons, she, James and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation.
In the Kanto contests, Jessie disguises herself as Jessebella (which is similar to James former fiancee Jessiebelle) wearing a red dress and glasses. Eventually, Ash, Brock, Max and May finds out her true identity at the last contest.
During the Kanto Grand Festival, Jessie dresses up as Jessadia (Japanese: キャンディ・ムサリーナ Candy Musalina). and wears glasses, long white socks, a yellow and orange dress, and has her hair in pigtails. She works there as an announcer and Lilian Meridian`s assistant; Lilian herself says she may not really like "Jessadia"`s style, but recognizes her talent. In the Latin American dub, she enters Super Contests under the name Jessiebella (referencing Jessiebelle again). Jessie currently still continues to use the Jessalina disguise while participating in Super Contests.
In "Pruning a Passel of Pals!" and "Strategy With a Smile!" she once again used her Jessadia disguise to report on the Wallace Cup.
Although Jessie had entered mostly every contest in Hoenn &amp; Kanto, she lost in every single one, whether it was the first match of the Battle Rounds or the finals. But in the Sinnoh Region, she has so far won 2 ribbons using her Dustox and Yanmega.</description>

<description>Meowth is a very unique Pokémon as it has many of the characteristics of a human. It walks on two feet, talks and is as smart as any human. Meowth is currently a member of Team Rocket and he travels around with Jessie and James trying to capture Pikachu and other rare Pokémon for Giovanni.
Meowth generally finishes his sentences with "Nyaa (ニャー)" which is the equivalent of "meow" in English. This helps people remember that despite his ability to talk like a human, he still has cat character traits.
Meowth is also known for coming up with his many schemes to try to capture Pikachu. While Jessie and James always agree with Meowth and think his plans are brilliant, they are generally foiled by Ash and his friends.
Long Con to Access Raimon City Pokémon Center
Meowth schemed with Jessie, James and Doctor Zager to figure out a way for them to infiltrate the Raimon City Pokémon Center where high-leveled Pokémon are stored in a vault that is protected by a security machine scan system that would only open if Nurse Joy (Isshu) or Nurse Joy`s Audino were scanned. Meowth pretended to be no longer part of Team Rocket making up a story that his made an error while executing a certain operation and when headquarters hear of his mistake, they told him he was fired.
Ash, Iris and Cilan believed him and allowed Meowth to travel with him. Pikachu though didn`t trust Meowth even though Meowth proved on numerous occasion that it should be trusted. Meowth`s plan was put into action when they arrived at the Raimon City Pokémon Center and as soon as Nurse Joy`s Audino was scanned to open the door, Meowth turned on Pikachu and the other and captured all the Pokémon in the vault. The long con had been a success and Meowth met up with Jessie and James below the Pokémon Center. Unfortunately, they weren`t able to get away as Ash and his friends realized that Meowth had just been conning them and they were able to stop Team Rocket.</description>

<description>James is one part of of the Team Rocket trio that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokémon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
James is mostly a comedic parody of bishounen characters; the English dub in particular tends to give him a melodramatic and even campy tone. He is somewhat famous for carrying a rose, though in more recent episodes he does not display it often. Mostly, his rose is displayed in the Team Rocket motto.
The only child of millionaires, James was forced to endure formal society. At a young age, he was forcefully engaged to a girl of whom he was terrified, Jessiebelle, all because his parents wanted to have a wealthy daughter-in-law. Thus, he ran away from home, leaving behind his beloved pet Growlie. He attempted to enroll in Pokémon Tech, a trainer`s school, but, along with his new friend Jessie, flunked out. Then, with Jessie, he joined the Sunny Town bicycle gang, where he was popular for being the only gang member to have to use training wheels (nicknamed "Trainer Jim"). Eventually James, Jessie, and the bike gang went their separate ways.
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between James and Jessie after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Since he is proficient in several activities, including Pokémon haiku and PokéRinger, it is possible that he developed his skills during his temporary separation from Jessie, but this is not known for sure.
In the episode "Holy Matrimony!", James returned to his home as a result of a trap by his parents, who pretended to be dead. He was reunited with his old pet Growlie and managed to avoid marrying Jessiebelle. Growlie stayed behind when James returned to Jessie and Meowth.
James has a tendency to be swindled by a Magikarp Salesman, who has on many occasions tricked him into buying a Magikarp or other useless Pokémon and items for large sums of money.
James also has a tendency to cross-dress, but has not done it since "Pros and Con Artists". He does, however, dress up like famous celebrities as well, such as Professor Oak, Juan, and Norman.
James loves rare bottle caps and has an impressive collection of them. In the episode "All That Glitters!" it is revealed that he has "drunk enough soda pop to float an aircraft carrier".
For unknown reasons, he, Jessie and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation. However in newer episodes the balloon is shown with `jets` attached to explain how they get from one place to another faster than walking.</description>

<description>The Beginning
Ash is the main character of the Pokémon anime. Raised in Pallet Town, he started his journey to become a Pokémon Master at the age of 10. On the day that he started his journey, Ash carelessly woke up late despite being told by his mother, Delia Ketchum to get to bed. He rushed to Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory only to find out that the beginner Pokémon - Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander - had already been given out to trainers who arrived on time. However, Professor Samual Oak mentioned that there was one more Pokémon available - Pikachu. Despite constantly hitting Ash with Electric-type attacks and refusing to return to its PokéBall, Ash decided to take Pikachu along with him on his journey to become a Pokémon Master. Pikachu is cold towards Ash at first and laughs at his failures; however, when Ash saves Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow, he begins to warm up to his new trainer and the two finally become friends. After the battle with the flock of Spearow, a Ho-Oh is seen flying towards a rainbow in the sky. The PokéDex reveals that the Ho-Oh is an unidentified Pokémon. Thus, the journey of Ash and Pikachu begins.
Captures in Viridian Forest
While making his way towards Pewter City and his first Kanto League Gym Battle, Ash came upon a wild Caterpie deep within Viridian Forest. Instead of using Pikachu to battle against the wild Pokémon, Ash took his chances and threw a PokéBall without weakining the Caterpie first. Luckily, he was able to catch the Pokémon without any trouble. The capture of Ash`s Caterpie marked Ash`s first capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Caterpie the second Pokémon to join his team.
The next day, while continuing the trek through the Viridian Forest, Ash came up on a wild Pidgeotto. He tried to just throw a PokéBall like he did with Ash`s Caterpie, but Pidgeotto swatted the PokéBall away. Misty informed that he must weaken the Pokémon first before attempting to capture it. He called out Ash`s Caterpie to battle against, but Misty quickly informed him that Bug-type Pokémon are weak against Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeotto. After Pidgeotto dealt significant damage to Ash`s Caterpie, Ash recalled it and sent out Pikachu. Pikachu was able to use its Thundershock to weaken Pidgeotto and allow Ash to capture it with a PokéBall. Thus, this capture marked Ash`s second capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Pidgeotto the third Pokémon to join his team.
Later on, while still in the Viridian Forest, Ash was approached by Team Rocket, who attempted to steal his Pokémon. After defeating Meowth, James`s Koffing, and Jessie`s Ekans, Ash`s Caterpie evolved into Ash`s Metapod.
Some of Ash`s greatest accomplishments have been at the various Pokémon Leagues. He was the victor at the Orange League and the Battle Frontier. He also competed in the Indigo League and the Johto Silver Conference where he placed admirably in both those competitions as well.
Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup
Ash participated in the Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup at the Kagome Town stadium. In the first round he was in the fifth match and faced off against Marris. The match was quickly showcased and Ash won the battle and advanced to the second round while Marris was eliminated from the tournament.
The Isshu League
Ash participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where he was matched up against Trip. Trip`s Serperior was sent out to battle Pikachu and Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior`s speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter Trip`s Serperior speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round. The two met in the Pokémon Center after the battle, and Trip vowed that the next time they met that he would win. The two shook hands and parted ways.
In the first main round, Ash`s opponent was shown on the match up electronic board but not much else is known about the battle. Ash`s Scraggy participated in the second main round of the Isshu League tournament where it faced off against a Darumakka. It was able to defeat it so that moved on to the next round.
In the third round, Stephan was matched up against Ash. Cilan noted that the two of them have a very direct taste and that it would be a good battle. It was only a 3 on 3 battle but the both of them gave it their all. The first two battles of the third round setup the final match up of Stephan`s Sawk vs Ash`s Krookodile, both of which were very injured from the previous battles. Both of them did their best to muster up their reserve strength but in the end a surprise move of Aerial Ace by Ash`s Krookodile was super effective against Stephan`s Sawk and it knocked it out to give Ash the victory while eliminating Stephan from the tournament. Stephan realized after the battle that the reason that Ash withdrew Waruvial after the first battle was because Ash knew that Stephan would definitely send out Dageki, so he didn`t reveal that it knew Aerial Ace and saved until the end.</description>

<description>The Beginning
On the morning that Ash was to start his Pokémon journey, he woke up late and by the time he reached Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory, all of the beginner Pokémon were already taken. However, Professor Samual Oak did have one Pokémon left, a wild Pikachu. At first, Pikachu did not like Ash and would refuse to enter his PokéBall. He would often laugh at Ash`s failures and refused to listen to him. However, after Ash proved his loyalty to Pikachu by protecting him from a flock of Spearow, and thus began to earn Pikachu`s trust and respect. The two have since become best friends and Pikachu never leaves Ash`s side.
Since the day Team Rocket first encountered Pikachu, it has been their sole goal to capture it. Day after day, their plan to capture Pikachu has been thwarted mainly due to Pikachu`s amazingly powerful Thunderbolt that keeps on blasting them off.
On numerous occasions, Pikachu has made it evident that he is happy being a Pikachu and has no desire to evolve into a more powerful Raichu. It has proven time and time again that it is a powerful and worthy opponent to any Pokémon that dares to battle it.
Gym Battle against Burgh`s Leavanny
Pikachu was then sent out to battle Burgh`s Leavanny. Burgh`s Leavanny managed to tie up Pikachu with String Shot but unlike Ash`s Swadloon who was able to break free, Pikachu ended up getting hit with a couple of Leaf Storm attacks and a Hyper Beam before it rolled into another of Burgh`s Leavanny`s Leaf Storm attacks to break the string off its body so it could attack. Freed from the String Shot, Burgh`s Leavanny tried to tie it up again but Pikachu managed to avoid it with its speed and then knocked Burgh`s Leavanny out with a combination of Iron Tail and Electro Ball.
Gym Battle against Elesa
Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy and was then matched up with Pikachu. Pikachu made quick work of Elesa`s Emolga and knocked it out with one attack, its Iron Tail.
Elesa`s Tynamo was the last Pokémon that she used in her gym battle against Ash. It was matched up against Pikachu who had just defeated her Emonga. Pikachu had a hard time defending against the fast Tackle attack that Elesa`s Tynamo kept hitting it with but Pikachu used its Thunderbolt to create a large dust cloud leaving only a small corridor for Pikachu to focus on it and so Elesa`s Tynamo couldn`t maneuver out of the way. Pikachu one hit K.O`d Elesa`s Tynamo with a Iron Tail. The loss gave Ash the overall victory.
Battle against Alder`s Bouffalant
Ash challenged Alder to a battle and he accepted though he had been walking all night and was actually quite tired. Alder sent out his Buffron to battle Pikachu but just as the battle started, Alder fell asleep standing up and didn`t give any orders to his Buffron. Alder`s Bouffalant stood still as Pikachu began hitting it with attack after attack until it Alder`s Bouffalant finally got mad at Alder and charged at him and set him flying into a tree. After that, Alder`s Bouffalant no longer wished to battle and Alder conceded the battle.
Gym Battle against Skyla
In Skyla air battle simulation, Ash`s Tranquill was matched up against Skyla`s Unfezant and since her Pokémon was the highest evolved form, she determined that her Pokémon would be the winner in that match-up. In the actual gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was up against Skyla`s Unfezant which was the match-up just after Ash`s Tranquill had defeated Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla`s Unfezant proved to be stronger and faster than Ash`s Tranquill, so Ash recalled it and set out Pikachu. Pikachu had a definite advantage over Skyla`s Unfezant with its electric attacks and it quickly knocked it out with its Electro Ball attack.
Ash Just after Pikachu ended up knocking out Skyla`s Unfezant, Skyla`s Swanna was sent out to battle against it. Skyla had been watching her grandpa`s battle videos and noticed that he used the move Aqua Ring to defend against Electric attacks. She used that same defense against Pikachu which nullified its Electric attacks. It`s Iron Tail also couldn`t hit it so high in the air. Ash then noticed the rings in the air and Pikachu jumped up on them and managed to hit Skyla`s Swanna but not directly. Pikachu was now up in the air though and Skyla`s Swanna had the advantage there and it quickly knocked Pikachu out with a powerful Brave Bird attack.
Battle Against Trip`s Serperior at the Isshu League
Pikachu participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where it is was matched up against Trip`s Serperior. Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter its speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round.</description>

Wobbuffet was first seen walking around with Benny, his previous trainer. Jessie traded her Lickitung for Wobbuffet and it has been with her ever since that day.
Wobbuffet rarely battles but when he does, his Counter and Mirror Coat moves have proved to be very effective. Unfortunately, Jessie`s tactics aren`t always sufficient to master Wobbuffet`s superior defensive skills.
Wobbuffet also randomly comes out of his Pokeball, especially during the Team Rocket motto. He is also seen blasting off with Jessie regardless if he was actually part of the action.</description>

As such, his role in the Pokémon games and anime is that of a mentor to young Pokémon Trainers, a source of information and an occasional plot device. Amongst other things, he is credited with inventing the Pokédex. He also hands out a Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander to beginning trainers (depending on which Pokémon the trainer chooses) to start their adventure in the Kanto Region. Although he is an expert on all matters relating to Pokémon, Professor Oak specializes in Pokémon behavioural science. He appears in Pokémon 4Ever as a child who was pulled into the future by Celebi. Additionally, it is apparent after Pokémon 3: The Movie that he knew Delia Ketchum since she was a child; this most likely is the reason he occasionally exhibits parental-type concern (mainly in the form of scolding Ash as he is doing something that is dangerous). He also creates poems centred around Pokémon and is known as the rhyming professor by Dawn.</description>

Excadrill didn`t always want to obey Iris when its asked to do something. For awhile, it was stubborn but Iris`s Excadrill was able to overcome the feelings of resentment and lost of trust it felt from the battle against Drayden`s Haxorus. After relating her experience to Ash and Cilan, it became more clear to Iris that she was not fully understanding her Excadrill`s feelings. Iris apologized to her Excadrill as she finally realized that her Excadrill knew after the first hit during the battle against Drayden`s Haxorus that they couldn`t win against it. The two of them then practiced all through the night until Excadrill was finally able to successfully launch the Focus Blast.
Rival Langley
While on route to Raimon City, Iris encountered Georgia, a Dragon Buster who once had a battle in the Dragon Village and her Pokémon was beaten up and now has it out for anyone from the village. Georgia managed to coax Iris into a battle but Iris`s Axew was no match for Georgia`s Beartic and Georgia ended up intimidating and angering Iris by saying the victory was easy and boring. Iris though was determined to defeat her new rival and during the rematch battle she managed to end it in a draw.
Don Battles
Iris entered the Don Battles, a battle tournament to be held in Raimon Town, with her friends and rivals. Jimmy Ray was easily defeated in the first round by Iris.
Stephan`s Sawk battled against Iris`s Emolga in the second round of the Don George Battle Tournament in Raimon Town but Emonga`s Static ability proved to be the deciding factor in the match. The Static ability ended up paralyzing Stephan`s Sawk and it was then a sitting target for Iris`s Emolga`s Volt Switch which knocked it out. Iris`s Emolga`s win eliminated Stephan from the tournament.
Iris`s Axew and Luke`s Golett were matched up in the semi-final round of the Don Battles in Raimon Town. Luke`s Golett dominated most of the battle and just as Iris`s Axew was about to be defeated, it learned the move Outrage. Outrage was able to do significant damage to Luke`s Golett and it knocked it out which eliminated Luke from the tournament.
In the finals, Iris battled against Ash and though it was a close battle, Iris`s Excadrill had the type advantage against Pikachu and she won the tournament. For winning, Iris received the beautiful seven-feather "Top-Class Driftveil Wing Set," containing Health, Muscle, Resist, Genius, Clever, Swift, and Pretty Wings which she sent to Dragon Village via Pidove Shipping Service.
Day Care Monozu
In BW58, befriended a shy and lonely Monozu that was awaiting its Trainer to return. As Monozu`s are a Dragon Type Pokémon, Iris was instantly excited to spend time with it. It took her awhile to gain its trust though. Iris recalled an event to Monozu that she witnessed in the Dragon Village where she saw Elder befriend a Crimgan that got lost and somehow found its way into the Village. The Crimgan absolutely refused to get along with other Dragon types and the people of the Village. For days and days, the Crimgan wouldn`t come out from deep within the cave. The Elder waited for Crimgan at the entrance of the cave the whole time and she tried to make the Crimgan open its heart to her, by talking to it like the way Iris was talking to Monozu to gain its trust and friendship. After several days had passed, Crimgan came out of the cave. All the Elder had done was talk to it and still, she managed to free it from its insecurities.
Iris uses the same technique that Elder used and the shy Monozu became more open with Iris and the two of them became friends. Iris spent a few days with the Monozu as they awaited the Trainer to return. At one point, Iris suggested to the Monozu if its Trainer didn`t return that it could come with her. The Trainer did return though and Monozu left with it but not before it gave Iris its biggest smile.
Fukiyose Tower Bell of Wishes Festival
Stephan met up with Iris and her friends and informed them of the Fukiyose Tower Bell of Wishes Festival that he was going to participate in. After hearing from him that it was an awesome event held once a year at the Fukiyose Tower, Iris and her friends decided to enter the tournament with Stephan.
Iris and Iris`s Axew paired up for the tournament. In the scavenger hunt, Iris asked Cilan to lent her his fishing rod so she could advance to the next round. In the tub race, Iris`s Axew used Dragon Rage on the surface of the water to propel them to the next round. During the imitation competition, iris was forced to dress-up as Professor Juniper and Miles thought she did quite well and he advanced her to the next round. In the forest of trials, Iris thought she had won but Chandela`s Confuse Ray affected her and she was in the middle of the forest for the entire race and was therefore eliminated from the tournament.
Rematch Battle against Drayden at the Soryu Gym
Having accepted the challenge to battle at the Dragon Village, Iris met up with Drayden to have a rematch battle. He heard about Iris getting into trouble again by climbing the Soryu Tower but told here to eat something and have a rest while he had a school meeting and then they would have their battle.
During the battle, Drayden was evaluating how much Iris had grown and he noticed that Iris`s Excadrill power certainly seemed to have improved. The matchup between Iris`s Excadrill and Drayden`s Haxorus ended up in a draw as the two of them knocked each other out. In the matchup between, Drayden`s Druddigon and Iris` Dragonite, Drayden noted that Iris` Dragonite had had an interesting life during its past. Iris` Dragonite wanted to fight under the same conditions as Drayden`s Druddigon, who cannot fly. Everyone thought that Iris was doing well in the battle but Drayden`s Druddigon proved to be more powerful than they had anticipated. Drayden`s Druddigon knocked out Iris` Dragonite with a powerful Dragon Tail attack to give Drayden the victory in the rematch battle. Cilan thought Iris had cornered him, but Drayden was still a few steps ahead. Drayden was trying to get a clear picture of Iris by drawing out their power.
Drayden complemented Iris on making good friends and he realized that sending her off on a journey was the right thing to do. He could tell that she had grown up but standing still wasn`t good for her. He told her to strengthen herself even further, become stronger and grow and then visit him again.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Cilan is a gym leader of Sanyo City Gym where he shares the responsibility with Chili and Cress. He is also a Pokémon Sommelier who, with his abundance of knowledge and experience, determines the compatibility of Trainers and Pokémon and gives them advice on how to befriend each other. Cilan specializes in Grass type Pokémon and his main Pokémon and partner is Yanappu. Cilan revealed during BW19 that he had passed the required exams of the Pokémon Sommelier association to become a certified A-class Sommelier who is able to make compatibility diagnoses.
Cilan has many female fans who flock to his presence though he puts off their advances almost immediately. Brock has been quoted saying that, "Cilan is gay." and Shigeru`s fanclub has extended an invitation to all female Cilan fans to join the Gary Oak`s fanclub instead! The Polish drug scene has seen an increase in the usage of the ACE inhibitor Cilan (Cilazapril) as a result of Cilan flamboyant escapades at night. In the English closed captions for BW12, the transcribers listed Cilan as `Cilas`. A quick google search for `Cilas` and the first result is Cialis, an erectile dysfunction disorder drug.
It`s Dent Time! - Dent`s Catch Phrases
Dent in the Japanese original has various phrases that are based off his original "It`s Tasting Time!" catch phrase. It`s generally modified in the episode to match what`s going on in that particular instance. Below is a list of these catch phrases.
It`s Cilan Time! - Cilan`s Catch Phrases
Cilan in the English Dub has various phrases that are based off Dent`s original "It`s Tasting Time!" catch phrase. Some of them are exclusive to the English dub.
Rival Cabernet
Burgundy is Pokémon Sommelière and a Pokémon Trainer who upon passing the C-class Sommelier test, decided to challenge Cilan at the Sanyo Gym for the Tri Badge. Cilan defeated her but when Burgundy returned to challenge Cilan at the gym, Chili and Cress had to explain that Cilan was on a journey and was no longer at the gym. Angry that Cilan was not the gym leader when she visited, she battled at the gym anyhow and won the Tri Badge.
Cilan encountered her at a Friendly Shop while on his way to Hiun City and she was now out for revenge. Burgundy challenged Cilan to a revenge battle where she ended up losing to him yet again. More angry than ever, she vowed to defeat Cilan the next time they met while working to become an S-class Sommelière and she took off.
Fishing Sommelier
In BW26, Cilan stated that he was a Fishing Sommelier. He was able to help Bianca learn how to fish better by showing her how to select a good fishing rod and then the two basic forms of casting techniques: the overhead cast and the side hand cast. Cilan also showed her the proper lure techniques by spinning the reel slowly and not rushing to attempt to catch the Water Pokémon. He has his own fishing rod that is collapsible and easy to carry. Cilan proved his Fishing Sommelier were quite good by catching a large Bassrao at the Fishing Tournament.Cilan`s Stunfisk was also captured by using his fishing skills.
Science Sommelier
In BW33, Cilan explained that he is not only a Pokémon Sommelier but also a Science Sommelier. A Science Sommelier is someone who tries to solve any kind of supernatural phenomenon by finding out the cause scientifically by collecting evidence and proving their theory. Cilan has always tried to solve mysterious problems scientifically like the poltergeist that he and his friends encountered at the Shippo Museum in BW14 which turned out to be a Deathmas.
Movie Sommelier
In BW40, Cilan announced that he as a Movie Sommelier, someone that is able to review, critique and analyze the different elements of a movie and its characters. Cilan specifically showed his knowledge as a Movie Sommelier when he was helping out with Luke`s movie "Legend of the Pokémon Knight" by making suggestions and improvising on the go. He also helped out Ash who was a bit nervous being in front of the camera and he talked about the famous movie, "The Mask of Deathmas", where the heroine is portrayed as putting her life on the line for the sake of acting. He told Ash that in order to move the viewers with his performance, he`d need to become the role he was assigned.
Metro Sommelier
While heading down to the underground railway in Raimon City, Cilan professed that he was also a Metro Sommelier. Metro Sommeliers are divided into a "car group", which is particular about the cars or into a "line group", which is particular about the lines. Cilan said he belonged to the car group. being a metro sommelier is basically joining a fan club for people that metro transit. Cilan met Subway Boss Ingo and Subway Boss Emmet at the previous years subway convention. Cilan`s knowledge came in quite handy when he had to drive the rail carriage to catch up to Team Rocket.
In BW53, Cilan used his skills as a Metro Sommelier to help him complete the subway station stamp rally so he could battle against Subway Boss Ingo and Subway Boss Emmet. Cilan had been dreaming of doing the rally for many years so he could battle them as its considered a great honor for Metro Sommelier`s. Cilan was also able to use his knowledge and skills as a Metro Sommelier to reunite Erina with her Kibago.
Trial Sommelier
While in Astilbe Town, Ash`s Tepig original owner Shamus was put on trial by Cilan after he revealed that he was a Trial Sommelier. He presented himself as an impartial courtroom judge in the Karakusa Town Pokabu Abandonment case where Prosecutor Ash told about the cruel abandonment of Ash`s Tepig where it had a rope tied up around its mouth. The defendant Shamus told a different story though as he said that forcing a talentless Pokémon into futile battles is crueler. Unable to make a decision in the case, Don George suggested that the verdict be decided with a battle and Cilan agreed. After Ash`s Pignite defeated Shamus, Cilan said the battle had a superb taste and that there`s no need to hand down a verdict as it`s obvious that Ash and Ash`s Tepig were right.
Gym Battle against Skyla
After watching Skyla perform `air battles` which were her determining how a battle would go against her gym challengers by simulating the battle in her head, Cilan got very upset that she was not actually doing the battles and he challenged her to a battle. Cilan agreed to do an `air battle` with her and she determined that he would loose the battle against her with the Pokémon he had chosen to battle her with. Cilan though wanted to have a real battle with her a he explained to her that with Pokémon battle, like any meal, must be tasted first before people can be certain to know anything. Skyla agreed and Cilan thought that he would be able to show her up by defeating her in a real battle and showing how her `air battles` are flawed. Unfortunately Cilan ended up loosing to Skyla but Ash challenged her to a battle right after.
Fukiyose Tower Bell of Wishes Festival
Stephan met up with Cilan and his friends and informed them of the Fukiyose Tower Bell of Wishes Festival that he was going to participate in. After hearing from him that it was an awesome event held once a year at the Fukiyose Tower, Cilan and his friends decided to enter the tournament with Stephan.
During the quiz, Cilan didn`t know how they`d be able to answer the question about who Miles liked better as it was a very subjectional question. Miles was going to pick Nurse Joy (Isshu) as the girl he preferred the most but Cilan seemed to notice Ricky`s Elgyem use its abilities to affect Miles but didn`t say anything as they were able to successfully get the question right and move on to the next round.
In the scavenger hunt, Cilan successfully managed to find a Miracle Shooter while he lent his fishing rod to Iris. In the tub race, Cilan`s Pansage on instruction from Cilan, paddled in the water the same way it used Dig to advance them to the next round. During the imitation competition, Cilan was forced to dress as Elesa and Cilan`s Pansage was forced to dress-up as Elesa`s Emolga. Everyone thought Cilan did an amazing job but Miles informed Cilan that he was a very big Elesa fan and he had to be very strict with imitations of her. Cilan was then eliminated from the tournament.
Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup
Cilan participated in the Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup at the Kagome Town stadium. In the first round he was in the third match and faced off against Shepherd. The match was quickly showcased and Cilan won the battle and advanced to the second round while Shepherd was eliminated from the tournament.</description>

Pokémon Restoration Device
In BW39, Fennel and Professor Juniper finished creating the Pokémon Restoration Device which is used to revive ancient Pokémon from fossils. Fennel`s Musharna was hooked up to the device so its dream energy could be used in the Pokémon restoration process. After receiving a Feather Fossil from Lenora, the device was able to analyze the genetic information from the fossil to revive the ancient bird Pokémon Archeos. The Pokémon Restoration Device was later destroyed by Archeos`s tree which resonated along with Archen`s cry.
Team Rocket though was able to hack into Fennel`s computer network and copy the design data of the Pokémon Restoration Device and sent the information to Doctor Zager.
Link Trade Machine and Tag Battle Against Ash and Cilan
Professor Juniper brought her link trade device to investigate the influence the Electric Stones have on evolutions. She setup the device at her base camp outside the caves. She agreed to trade her Karrablast for Bianca`s Shelmet using the machine after they figured out what was causing the electric abnormality that was affecting the machine.
After Bianca`s Shelmet and Professor Juniper`s Karrablast evolved via link trade, Professor Juniper suggested to Bianca that they team up and have a tag battle against Ash and Cilan. Ash`s Boldore and Cilan`s Crustle had recently evolved so they decided to use them against Bianca`s Escavalier and Professor Juniper`s Accelgor. After Professor Juniper`s Accelgor did a quick Recover, Professor Juniper`s Accelgor and Bianca`s Escavalier started working together and they combined their Hyper Beam attacks which knocked out Ash`s Boldore. Cilan`s Crustle fought back with its powerful Rock Wrecker to knock out both Bianca`s Escavalier and Professor Juniper`s Accelgor and give Ash and Cilan the tag battle win.
After the battle, Professor Juniper checked both Bianca`s Escavalier and her Accelgor`s data to notice that their power has increased by a whole lot. She also noted that they fought really well even though their opponent Cilan was Gym Leader.</description>

<description>Joy is the name for every member of an identical family of Pokémon nurses. They mainly work in Pokémon Centers, but they also work in other locations. They are also often accompanied by a Chansey or Blissey. Like Chansey and Blissey, all Nurse Joys are mostly hospitable, especially towards Pokémon. Brock, who claims to be able to tell the Joys just by minor appearance details (different-colored crosses on their hats; hair is slightly shorter; smile is wider; etc.), is infatuated with every Nurse Joy he meets, and often has to be restrained by a traveling companion. Although all of them look completely identical to each other, some do have different personalities, and a few even other occupations besides nursing. There is a Nurse Joy who is a body builder, a contest judge and even one who is scared of water Pokémon. In the Pokémon Diamond and Pearl series, there was also a Nurse Joy who is married and has two daughters who both have the name "Joy" at the end of their names and looks exactly like their mother rather than their father. Pokémon: The Electric Tale of Pikachu manga author Toshihiro Ono cited her as one of his favorite characters to draw for the series, stating the reason as "because she`s a girl".</description>

<description>Ash caught 30 Tauros while at the Kanto Safari Zone
Orange League Final - Vs. Ash Ketchum (Rocky Field)
Ash chooses Tauros as his third Pokémon to go against Drake`s Gengar.
Ash tells Tauros to begin with Fissure but Gengar jumps into the air and avoids the attack. Whilst in the air Gengar uses Confuse Ray which makes Tauros attack the nearby rock and damage itself in the process. Ash quickly recalls Tauros and sends out Lapras in the water pool in the middle of the stage.
Lapras and Gengar battled each other and ended up eliminating each other when their attacks collided.
With Drake losing his third Pokémon there was a short interval whilst the battle field change into a sandy field.
Orange League Final - Vs. Ash Ketchum (Sand Field)
The interval ended and Drake began by choosing Venusaur whilst Ash brought Tauros back into the battle who had now recovered from Gengar`s Confuse Ray. Ash`s first move was to have Tauros stamp its feet to use Fissure, however, the soft sand absorbed the move. Drake took advantage of the situation by having Venusaur use Solarbeam but knowing Solarbeam takes a while to charge up, Ash have Tauros charge straight towards Drake`s Venusaur and flip it into the air just before it fired. Venusaur managed to adjust itself mid-air and fire the Solarbeam at Tauros. The impact was close to Tauros and knocked it down but it managed to recover and get back to its feet quickly.
Venusaur struck Tauros with one of its Vine Whip attacks but Tauros manage to avoid any further strikes and successfully land a Take Down move on Venusaur and eliminate it from the battle.
Drake sent out Electabuzz and Ash decided to give Tauros another rest and switched in Bulbasaur.
Tauros was switched in again after Ash recalled the eliminated Squirtle. Tauros charged into the middle of the field whilst Dragonite flew up and use Body Slam. To Drake`s surprise Ash told Tauros to stand its ground and endure the hit, which it does so successfully and even manages to throw Dragonite to the floor using its horns.
Dragonite get up and uses Thunderbolt which proves too much for Tauros and eliminates it from the battle leaving Ash with one Pokémon left.
After Ash had won the battle against Drake he called out all of his Pokémon that participated in the battle on the stage as Drake presented him with the Winner`s Trophy. Then Ash, Pikachu, Tauros, Lapras, Squirtle, Bulbasaur and Charizard all had their handprints set in stone to be remembered in the Orange Island Hall of Fame.</description>

Kanto Pokémon League Tournament
Round 4 - Vs Ash Ketchum - Grass Field
Despite looking like a weak opponent Jeanette`s Bellsprout managed to KO both Ash`s Bulbasaur and his Pikachu. Ash turned to Muk who he transferred from Prof. Oak just before the battle.
Due to Muk`s slow speed and bigger size it could not avoid Bellsprouts attack but thanks to its slimy and elastic body it was simply able to absorb them and not feel any damage. Bellsprout continued to launch a number of ounches, kicks and throws but still Muk absorbed them all. After repelling a Razor Leaf attack Muk smothered Bellsprout with its body and after a few seconds of struggling Bellsprout was defeated, giving Ash the victory and earned him a place in the final 16.
Please with its victory it gave Ash a hug which forced Ash to the ground. Ash laughed and praised Muk for giving him the victory.</description>

<description>Kanto Pokémon League Tournament
Round 4 - Vs Jeanette Fisher - Grass Field
Ash selected Bulbasaur as his first Pokémon whilst Jeanette choose her Beedrill. As the faster Pokémon, Beedrill charged at bulbasaur at full speed, however Bulbasaur mananged to evade and return a Razor Leaf attack. Once again Beedrill used its superior speed, avoiding the Razor Leaf attack whilst also getting itself in a good position to use a Twin Needle atttack on Bulbasaur. Despite being on the backfoot, Bulbasaur managed to dodge the Twin Needle attack and Beedrill`s Stinger. After jumping backwards, Bulbasaur created enough space to be able to use its Leech Seed attack which struck Beedrill on its attacking stinger. Beedril was stuck in Leech Seed forcing it to the floor and Ash had bulbasaur finish it off using a Tackle attack which gave Ash the Initial Advantage in the battle.
Like Beedrill, Scyther had an advantage in speed and used this by quickly trying to attack Bulbasaur with its blades. After beeing unsuccessful, Jeanette order Scyther to used a Swift attack which managed to hit Bulbasaur a few times and was useful in deflecting its Vine Whip attack. Jeanette ordered Scyther to use a Double Team attack to which Ash had Bulbasaur to attempt to hit the real Scyther. The attempt failed and Scyther was able to land a few strikes by charging at Bulbasaur and managed to evade Bulbasaur`s counter of a Razor Leaf and Vine Whip attack. Ash had Bulbasaur use its Vine Whip once more but told it to swing the vines towards all of the copies which Double Team created, knowing that Bulbasaur would have to hit the real one in the process. The plan worked and Scyther was struck by Vine Whip, eliminating it from the battle.
Jeanette released her final Pokémon of the round which was a Bellsprout. Her choice suprised her a few people including Bulbasaur, as by apperance alone Bellsprout could be considered a weak Pokémon.
Ash had Bulbasaur charge at Bellsprout but managed to flip it above its head using its own momentum against itself. Ash was stunned by Bellsprout`s agility. Bulbasaur was angered at being tossed aside so easily and charged once again at Bellsprout, but like before, was thrown away using its own momentum. Bellsprout took advantage of Bulbasaur being on the floor and thrown it towards Ash`s podium, showing great strength and eliminated Bulbasaur from the tie.
Ash quickly rushed Pikachu into battle to try and finish Bellsprout off.
Orange League Final - Vs. Ash Ketchum (Sand Field)
Bulbasaur was Ash`s fifth choice Pokémon in his winner`s trophy battle against Drake. Bulbasaur`s first opponent was against Drake`s Electabuzz.
Bulbasuar manage to shake of Electabuzz`s initial Thundershock attack and returned a Razor Leaf attack which struck Electabuzz, although, whilst being hit by Razor Leaf, Electabuzz manage to use a Thunderbolt attack that Bulbasaur quickly dodged.
Bulbasaur uses Tackle and causes some light damage to Electabuzz but taking advantage of how close Bulbasur was, it manage to hit Bulbasaur with a Thunderpunch which eliminated it.
After Ash had won the battle against Drake he called out all of his Pokémon that participated in the battle on the stage as Drake presented him with the Winner`s Trophy. Then Ash, Pikachu, Tauros, Lapras, Squirtle, Bulbasaur and Charizard all had their handprints set in stone to be remembered in the Orange Island Hall of Fame.</description>

Kanto Pokémon League:
Fifth Round - Vs Ritchie.
Ash gambled on using a disobient Charizard and he was trailing in the battle and his other Pokémon were tired.
Charizard originally appeared like it was not going to do anything but after Ritchie`s Charmander narrowly missed with a flamethrower, Charizard decided to fight back with a flamethrower of its own with panicked Charmander and forced Ritchie to recall it.
Pikachu was Ritchie`s third and final Pokémon in the battle and was against Ash`s Charizard which had just forced Charmander to be switched. Charizard trembled the ground with a couple of stomps making Pikachu lose its balance and then blew Pikachu away using a gust from its wings. Seemingly thinking Pikachu was not a worthy opponent, Charizard took a nap in the middle of a battle and despite Ash pleaded with it to battle, it was eliminated. This gave Sparky the victory over Charizard and put Ritchie into round six.
Ash angrily recalled Charizard into its ball.
Orange Islands.
Ash called upon Charizard to battle Tad`s Poliwrath which had a reputation of being a very strong Pokémon. Charizard refused to listen to Ash`s orders and Poliwrath shoots a water gun on Charizards tail making the flame much smaller, then a subsuquent Ice Beam hits Charizard and freezes it. The battle left Charizard very injured and Ash had to keep its tail flame alive much like he did when he first found it as a Charmander.
Despite an intial struggle, Charizard saw how much Ash cared for him and once it reached full health in the morning Charizard became friendly with Ash and even obeyed Ash during Battle.
Charizard then went on to defeat Tad`s Poliwrath in a re-match.
Orange League Final - Vs. Ash Ketchum (Sand Field)
Ash chose Charizard to battle against Electabuzz and ordered it to use Flamethrower against Electabuzz, who quickly jumped into the air and landed a Thunderpunch onto Charizard and follwowed up by shocking Charizard with an electric attack. Charizard managed to release himself from the electricity by firing a Fire Spin and then Charizard flew towards Electabuzz quickly making sure it could not use it Thunderbolt attack. Charizard got a good grip on Electabuzz and flew into the air and used Seismic Toss on it which eliminated it and left Drake with one Pokémon left.
Drake`s final Pokémon was his prized Dragonite who he sent out to battle Ash`s Charizard.
Charizard moved first by using a Flamethrower attack but Dragonite countered by using Water Gun which cuts through the Flamethrower and hits Charizard, who then takes to the skies whilst avoiding Dragonite`s Ice Beam.
Dragonite then takes to the sky itself showing great speed as it does so. Dragonite and Charizard exchange Ice Beam and Flamethrower attacks respectively but it is Dragonite who manages to clip Charizard wing using Ice Beam which send Charizard spinning to the ground. Charizard recovers and flies close to Dragonite in an attempt to use a Seismic Toss attack, however, Dragonite avoids and gets a good grip on Charizard which gives it the opportunity to use a Slam attack.
Charizard gets up quick although it is clearly tired but it has enough stength to launch a Dragon Rage attack. Dragonite uses the same move, the attacks collide and both Pokémon are sent flying backwards. When the dust settles both Pokémon are standing but exhausted from the previous battle, after a few deep breaths Charizard falls to the ground and is eliminated.
After Ash had won the battle against Drake he called out all of his Pokémon that participated in the battle on the stage as Drake presented him with the Winner`s Trophy. Then Ash, Pikachu, Tauros, Lapras, Squirtle, Bulbasaur and Charizard all had their handprints set in stone to be remembered in the Orange Island Hall of Fame.</description>

<description>Kanto Pokémon League - Round One (Water Field) - Vs Mandi
Ash`s Krabby evolved into a Kingler after defeating an Exeggutor during a battle against Mandi.
Mandi sent out a Seadra in an attempt in regain the advantage in the battle in the water field and ordered it to charge at Kingler. Ash`s response was to have Kingler use Water-Gun on Seadra but failed to land a hit. Kingler switched its attacks to Bubble and managed to send the Seadra skywards. Ash had Kingler do a crabhammer attack and managed to score Kingler`s second victory of the battle, its first as a Kingler.
Ash once again stuck with Kingler as Mandi send Golbat out to try and make a comeback. Kingler found itself at a disadvantage as it struggled to cope with Golbats speed and found that Golbat could avoid its Vicegrip attempt with ease. Kingler was knocked onto one of the platforms just above the water level and as Golbat attempted to get close for a Mega-Drain attack it managed to counter with Hyper-Beam which gave Kingler his third victory and put Ash into the second round of the Competition.
After the battle a clearly delighted Ash thanked Kingler for providing him with his first ever win in a Pokémon League tournament.
Kanto Pokémon League - Round Third (Ice Field) - Vs Pete Pebbleman
After both Ash and Pete has lost a Pokémon the battle was now down to Ash`s Kingler and Pete`s Cloyster. Both Pokémon approached each other slowly before Ash order Kingler use its crabhammer attack to which Pete told his Cloyster to withdraw into its shell. Despite seemingly causing little damage, Kingler persisted in hitting the withdrawn Cloyster with Pete unable to find a way to counter. Kingler kept up the barrage of attacks even though it was starting to tire out and eventually it paid off as Kingler cracked Cloyster`s shell, KO`ing it in the process. This victory gave Ash the advantage in the third round and Pete attempted to make a comeback by using an Arcanine.
Pete`s choice of Pokémon came to a suprise to some people as the battle was taking place on the ice field.
Knowing about Arcanine`s type disadvantage to Kingler, Ash confidently ordered Kingler to use a Bubble attack, however, Arcanines speed on the icy terrain was quick and manage to dodge Kingler`s attack.
Arcanine had managed to find some space on the battlefield and launched a Dragon Rage attack which swept Kingler off its feet and into some ice. A dazed Kingler attempted to get to its feet but Ash decided to switch to Pikachu.
Pikachu managed to defeat Arcanine which gave Ash and his Pokémon the victory in the third round.</description>

<description>When Ash and co. were traveling towards Daybreak Town for Dawn`s next Pokémon Contest, a mysterious Pokémon Trainer specializing in martial arts, named Clayton, challenged Ash and his Buizel to a battle after seeing how Buizel saved Gible who had fallen into a river. Clayton`s Mr. Mime proved to be a really strong opponent, though, as it managed to dodge Buizel`s Aqua Jet and SonicBoom attacks by skillfully using its Psychic and Double Team moves, eventually knocking Buizel out with a powerful ThunderPunch. Ash and Buizel, determined to make up for the loss by getting stronger, started training with Clayton`s help so that Buizel could learn a new move; Ice Punch. He told them that, in order to master the move, they had to work on improving their speed and concentration.
At first, the progress of Ash`s Buizel`s training seemed to be really slow. However, after training overnight using unstable and light objects as targets for its punches, like floating leaves, Buizel managed to master the move completely. After the completion of Buizel`s training, Ash challenged Clayton to a rematch, and Clayton accepted. Ash`s Buizel proved to be more of a challenge for its opponent, Mr. Mime, this time and after activating its ability, Swift Swim, in the midst of the battle due to a sudden rain, Buizel managed to increase its speed and finish Clayton`s Mr. Mime off with a powerful Ice Punch. Clayton then acknowledged Ash`s Buizel`s improvement and praised its skills, but also put emphasis on the fact that Buizel still had a long way to go and had to keep on training.</description>

<description>Patrat, known as the Lookout Pokémon, is a rodent-like Pokémon that resembles a chipmunk. It continues keeping watch for several days, saving up food in its cheek pouches. It signals to its companions with its tail. They are extremely wary and keep watch outside their burrows in turns. They become anxious if no one keeps watch.
Patrat first appeared in the first few episodes of the Pokémon: Black and White anime. Multiple Patrat made a brief cameo in Black and White episode 3 with multiple Pidove and Deerling where they needed help from Ash and his friends. In the Pokémon Master Black &amp; White manga, Monta captures a Patrat in the first chapter.
Patrat and its evolution Watchog were called "fairly unremarkable aside from their intense facial expressions" by GamesRadar`s Carolyn Gudmundson. Gudmundson later noted it as a "Bidoof analog", in spite of the fact that it can only learn one Hidden Machine, whereas Bidoof can learn many. She adds that it is very easy to become bored of it. Official Nintendo Magazine`s Chris Schilling commented that Patrat was the "new Bidoof".</description>

It eventually evolves into the Pokémon Swoobat by leveling up when its happiness is high. Happiness can be raised by fighting through many Pokémon battles. In the games, it was described as Black and White`s version of the Pokémon Zubat due to being of a similar species Woobat also appears in the Pokémon spin-off game Battle &amp; Get! Pokémon Typing DS where players type in the names of Pokémon that they see. In the anime, Jessie catches a Woobat while in a cave with James and Meowth. She uses it to battle against Ash and Iris. It manages to defeat Ash`s newly captured Pidove but is defeated by Oshawott`s Water Gun. Woobat has made other minor appearances in the anime. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, a Woobat is in the possession of the character White.
IGN described it as the baby of "a Tribble, a bat, and a pig". Game Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava stated "I kind of like the idea of having a romantic bat as a Pokémon... However, I`m not sold on its abilities". Jeremy Parish of Retronauts criticized the series` use of redundant new Pokémon, commenting that Woobat was the same as Zubat, referencing the uncanny similarities in name. IGN`s Jack DeVries questioned whether Woobat would act as a Zubat replacement. He later expressed that despite being unsure of Woobat`s quality, he wrote that "at least he`s not a Zubat". 1UP.com`s Kat Bailey wrote that Woobat was basically a Zubat with a pig`s snout. 1UP.com`s Michael Vreeland wrote that Woobat was "a lot more interesting" than Zubat. G4TV`s Nikole Zivalich, however wrote that Woobat was derivative and inferior to Zubat and that while fans will appreciate not having to run into so many Zubats, the "alternative isn`t much better". Carolyn Gudmundson of GamesRadar similarly described Woobat as the "new Zubat", noting that based on their looks, it and its evolution are two of their favourite Pokémon; however, they do note that they have some faults gameplay-wise.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Darumaka is a Fire-type Pokémon introduced in Generation V.
It evolves into Darmanitan starting at level 35.
In Galar, Darumaka has an Ice-type regional form. It evolves into Galarian Darmanitan when exposed to an Ice Stone.
Darumaka is a round, red Pokémon with an orange face and yellow curly eyebrows. It has three yellow ovals on its abdomen and a curvy yellow line on its back. Its paws are orange and have three digits each. It has very warm droppings, which ancient people put in their clothes to keep themselves warm.
When the flame inside its body burns, Darumaka is very active. It cannot calm down in this state, and thus becomes uncontrollable. As the flame shrinks, it falls asleep. It can tuck in its arms and legs when it rests; during that time, it slightly sways. While it is sleeping, it cannot be tipped over no matter how much it is pushed or pulled, like a tumbler doll, which it resembles in this state. It prefers to live in a desert environment.
Galarian Darumaka has a thicker coat than normal Darumaka, several turquoise ice crystals as its eyebrows and on its chest, and has blue hands and face with white snowy fur. Unlike its normal form, Galarian Darumaka has a timid frown instead of a mischievous smile.
Seismic shift in the Galar region long ago caused the warm climate to cool, and Darumaka in this region have adapted to this cooling. The fire that burned within their bodies went out, leaving an organ that produces cold air instead. The colder Darumaka gets, the more energetic it becomes. They can focus their internal energy to breathe out cold air in the form of snow, which they use to make snowballs for ammo in playful snowball fights with each other. Galarian Darumaka enjoys eating Berries produced by Snover. This leads it to prey on Snover often being driven off by Abomasnow.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Iris`s Axew was first seen appearing out of Iris`s large hairdo, much to the surprise of Ash and Pikachu. Ash helped rescue Axew from Team Rocket when they captured it just after Iris met Ash.
Axew is Iris`s main Pokémon and it doesn`t seem to like to travel in its monster ball. It seems to prefer traveling on Iris`s shoulders and in her hair.
Mastering Dragon Rage
Iris had been practicing Dragon Rage with her Kibago for quite a while and every time the attack was used it was unsuccessful and created a crater in the ground where the attack was used and injured everyone in the area. After being captured by Team Rocket along with Crimgan, Iris`s Axew managed to master Dragon Rage which was powerful enough to crash their flying transport mecha. In the battle encounter with Team Rocket that occurred after the crash, Iris`s Axew showed everyone that it had finally mastered the move by launching a successful attack at Team Rocket but they managed to escape before it hit them.
Don Battles Against Luke`s Golett
Iris`s Axew and Luke`s Golett were matched up in the semi-final round of the Don Battles in Raimon Town. Luke`s Golett dominated most of the battle and just as Iris`s Axew was about to be defeated, it learned the move Outrage. Outrage was able to do significant damage to Luke`s Golett and it knocked it out which eliminated Luke from the tournament.
Battle against Cynthia`s Garchomp / Learning Giga Impact
Iris asked to battle Cynthia`s Garchomp with her Kibago as she was working on becoming a Dragon Master. Even before it the started, the battled seemed like Cynthia`s Garchomp would win. Iris`s Axew could not do any damage to Cynthia`s Garchomp until it finally concentrated for a few moments and learned Giga Impact. While Giga Impact was able to do some damage to Cynthia`s Garchomp, it quickly overpowered Iris`s Axew until Cynthia decided to end the match before a finishing blow.</description>

<description>Ash first encountered Mijumaru at Professor Juniper laboratory as it was one of the Pokémon that Trip was to choose from. Ash called it cute when he first saw it which caused Mijumaru to blush a bit. After being shocked that it wasn`t chosen by Trip, it followed Ash and Pikachu as they started their journey in the Isshu region.
It rescued Pikachu and Iris`s Axew from Rocket Gang. Ash thanked it but quickly left it behind in the forest so that he could treat Pikachu. It continued following Ash until one day it met up again and tried to explain that it wanted to join Ash on his journey. Ash tried to capture it with one of his Poké balls but then realized it already had a Poké ball and that this Mijumaru must have been the same one that he met at Professor Juniper lab. He contacted Professor Juniper and she agreed to let him have the Mijumaru and transferred its Poké ball to him. By the time it had been transferred over, it had disappeared again.
Ash met up with Mijumaru once again when they were resting in the sands at Dan`s hotel. After protecting Ash from being scalded from a hot water geyser, Ash quickly recalled it into the Poké ball before it got scalded itself. Since then Ash`s Oshawott has had the tendency to come out of its Poké ball whenever it feels like despite what the current situation is.
Gym Battles against Lenora`s Watchog
During the first gym battle against Ash`s Oshawott, Lenora`s Watchog used Mean Look so Ash`s Oshawott couldn`t be switched out. Since Ash`s Oshawott wasn`t expecting to battle Lenora`s Watchog at that time, it was at a disadvantage and it was in a bad mood. After Ash`s Oshawott lost its shell during the battle, Lenora`s Watchog was able to use its Thunderbolt effectively to knock Ash`s Oshawott out of the match.
During the rematch battle against Lenora`s Watchog, Ash`s Oshawott had learned Aqua Jet during the time between the two battle and but its accuracy make it easy for Lenora`s Watchog to avoid it. Though through sheer luck, Ash`s Oshawott Aqua Jet managed to hit Lenora`s Watchog and both ended up getting knocked out at the same time as Lenora`s Watchog used Thunderbolt just before it got hit.
Three-on-Three Battle Against Trip`s Timburr
Ash`s Oshawott was paired up against Trip`s Timburr but the beginning of the battle didn`t go to well for Ash as Ash`s Oshawott had its eyes closed during Aqua Jet and completely missed hitting Trip`s Timburr. After a short break in the battle, the two finished up with their final attacks. Ash`s Oshawott`s Razor Shell proved to be stronger than Trip`s Timburr`s DynamicPunch and Ash`s Oshawott defeated Trip`s Timburr despite its initial problems with Aqua Jet`s accuracy.
Mastering Aqua Jet
While training in Don George`s pool for the battle against Lenora, Ash`s Oshawott learned Aqua Jet. It`s aim proved to be quite off but through sheer luck it was able to use Aqua Jet to knock out both Lenora`s Watchog and Stephan`s Blitzle. It wasn`t until Trip noticed by taking some pictures during his three-on-three battle with Ash that Ash`s Oshawott had its eyes closed during Aqua Jet. Ash vowed to help his Oshawott practice to keep its eyes open underwater so that its Aqua Jet`s targeting would be accurate.
While enroute to Raimon City, Ash, Iris and Cilan`s Pokémon all got poisoned and the only thing that could cure them was a waterweed plant found in a nearby lake. Ash`s Oshawott was training with Ash at the time and didn`t get poisoned and since it was a Water Pokémon, it was best suited for the job. Unfortunately Ash`s Oshawott still didn`t like to open its eyes underwater until it was forced to defend itself against a school of Tympole who were protecting their lake from trespassers. Ash`s Oshawott opened its eyes underwater to defend itself and it started to get comfortable doing so. Ash`s Oshawott was later forced to battle Palpitoad because it came out of the water to protect its lake. During the battle, Ash`s Oshawott managed to master its Aqua Jet as it was able to remember the battle against the Tympole school and how having its eyes opened underwater was quite effective and that proved to be the decisive factor in the battle as Palpitoad was knocked out and Ash caught it.
Battle against Bel`s Father`s Hihidaruma
Ash challenged Bianca`s Father to a Pokémon battle to allow Bianca to continue to travel. He agreed but changed the challenge to force Ash to return home to Pallet Town if he lost the battle. Ash`s Oshawott came out of its ball as it wanted to battle against Bianca`s Father`s Darmanitan and Ash thought that it would be okay because it had a type advantage being a water Pokémon. Even though Bianca`s Father`s Darmanitan only used Fire type moves throughout the battle, it proved to be too strong for Ash`s Oshawott. Ash`s Oshawott did manage to land an Aqua Jet. Bianca`s Father commented though that his Red Flash Hihidaruma gets more fired up the more resistance it faces and shortly after it knocked Ash`s Oshawott out. Despite loosing the battle, Bianca`s Father changed his mind because the battle with Ash and his Mijumaru made him remember the joy of traveling.
Battle Against Pod`s Baoppu
Initially, Ash was going to battle Chili`s Pansear with his Pikachu, but Ash`s Oshawott popped out and wanted to battle it instead. Ash agreed and despite the type disadvantage in this battle, Chili just got more fired up. Chili`s Pansear managed to cover its weakness with power and momentum and taking Cilan`s advice into account, it used Flame Charge to increase its speed to become useful when dodging Ash`s Oshawott moves. Chili`s Pansear managed to endure Ash`s Oshawott super effective moves just long enough for it to use its newly learned SolarBeam attack which Ash`s Oshawott was unable to dodge and it was knocked out. Chili`s Pansear won the battle despite the type disadvantage.
Battle Against Clay`s Krokorok
Clay`s Krokorok was the first Pokémon Clay used to battle against Ash during his gym battle. Clay`s Krokorok was paired up against Ash`s Oshawott as Pikachu initially wanted to battle it but Ash realized that an Electric type against a Ground type would be a bad idea.
At the beginning of the battle, Clay`s Krokorok had the upper hand as its Sandstorm managed to get sand in Ash`s Oshawott`s eyes and it also made it harder for Ash`s Oshawott to accurately attack. Clay`s Krokorok managed to hit Ash`s Oshawott with a Bite and a Stone Edge attack but it wasn`t enough to knock it out. Ash`s Oshawott used Water Gun to clear up the Sandstorm and then it began its counterattack. Clay`s Krokorok was repetitively hit with multiple attacks from Ash`s Oshawott including a super effective Aqua Jet and Razor Shell combo that ended up being too much for it and it was knocked out.
Battle Against Clay`s Palpitoad
Ash decided to keep his Oshawott out to battle against Clay`s Palpitoad and right away it became evident that Clay`s Palpitoad was the stronger Pokémon as its Hydro Pump ended up being more powerful than Ash`s Oshawott Water Gun. Clay`s Palpitoad followed up with a Sludge Bomb that knocked Ash`s Oshawott`s scallsword out of its hand and just as it was retrieving it, it got hit by Clay`s Palpitoad Rock Smash`s and was knocked out.
Ash`s Oshawott and Dawn`s Piplup Rivalry
Ash`s Oshawott and Dawn`s Piplup both fell in love with Meloetta and the two of them began a rivalry to win the affection of Meloetta. Ash`s Oshawott would often come out of its PokéBall when it could tell that Dawn`s Piplup was trying to take advantage of a situation. Even though the two of them often argued, they found a common ground and became friends after Meloetta left.</description>

Pokabu lost to a Shikijika during the battle and its trainer tied it to a pole and left it. The Pokabu ended up getting the string tied around its snout making it impossible for it to eat.
Ash saw Pokabu on the security camera video and thought it was an Umbreon because it was all dirty. When Ash finally spotted Pokabu, he cornered it in an alley and tried to be friendly with it. Ash noticed the rope tied around its snout and loosened it. Pokabu then helped rescue Pikachu from Team Rocket.
Iris wanted to get Pokabu but it wanted to be caught by Ash instead. Realizing that Pokabu wanted to travel with him, Ash captured Pokabu just outside the Battle Club in Karakusa Town.</description>

Battle Against Pod`s Baoppu
Chili wanted to see the results of Cilan`s studying and he challenged him to a battle. Chili thought that it would be an easy battle as they had the super effective type advantage but as the battle progressed Chili didn`t like the fact that Cilan`s Pansage kept avoiding all of Chili`s Pansear fire attacks and Chili told Cilan that running away all the time doesn`t make a battle. Cilan though told him that running away is a perfectly fine way to battle. Chili got more angry during the battle and after loosing he blamed his Baoppu for the loss as it missed its Fire Blast at the most crucial moment. Chili`s Pansear ran away in anger as it was mad it was getting blamed for the loss and Cilan then blamed Chili for the loss in the battle which only fueled Chili`s anger and he ran off as well.
Battle against Skyla
Skyla`s Unfezant was matched up against Cilan`s Pansage in Skyla`s air battle and she believed that her Unfezant would be victorious. In the actual gym battle, Skyla`s Swoobat was matched up against Cilan`s Pansage. It proved to be very fast in the air and easily dodged all of Cilan`s Pansage`s attacks. It only used two attacks against Cilan`s Pansage: a Air Cutter and a Gust attack before it knocked it out and gave Skyla the victory in the first round.
Tag Battle against Soran`s Warrgle and Riiku`s Mogurew

Ash`s Oshawott and Ash`s Tepig were both sent out to battle Tsutarja as well but it used Attract against them which proved quite effective due to the gender differences.

Gym Battle Against Elesa`s Emolga
After Elesa`s Emolga defeated Ash`s Palpitoad, Ash`s Snivy was sent out to battle against Elesa`s Emolga but Ash didn`t really have a battle strategy anymore since his Palpitoad had been defeated and he forgot that Emolga was also a Flying type. Elesa`s Emolga combination of Acrobatics and Aerial Ace was just too hard for Ash`s Snivy to defend against as the type advantage hampered it. Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy fairly easily.
Battle against Katharine`s Gothita
Katharine`s Gothita convinced Ash`s Scraggy to come with it outside to get something to eat. They ended up getting in trouble with a Garbodor and Katharine`s Deerling to use its Aromatherapy to calm down the raging Garbodor after Ash`s Snivy had followed them to see what they were up to. Katharine`s Gothita did not like the fact that Ash`s Snivy had been looking up on them and it decided it wanted to battle it.
Katharine`s Gothita was quite mad at Ash`s Snivy but it didn`t stand a chance against it in battle. Ash`s Snivy barely broke a sweat as it was able to counter and avoid all of Katharine`s Gothita`s attacks before it knocked it out with its Leaf Storm. Still upset, Katharine`s Gothita ran off into the distance.
Battle against Clay`s Palpitoad
After knocking out Ash`s Oshawott, Ash`s Snivy was sent out to replace it as Ash picked it because it was strong against both Ground and Water. Ash`s Snivy used Attract right at the beginning of their battle which prove to be an unexpected yet effective technique as Clay`s Palpitoad was unable to attack after the effects of Attract took hold of it. Ash`s Snivy pummeled Clay`s Palpitoad with effective Grass type attacks until it was knocked out.
Battle against Clay`s Excadrill
Ash kept his Snivy out to battle against Clay`s Excadrill but that matchup didn`t last long as Clay`s Excadrill was able to defend against all of Ash`s Snivy`s attacks. Ash`s Snivy was quickly knocked out with a strong Horn Drill.</description>

<description>Iris`s Excadrill was revealed when she was required to rescue her Axew from a raging Pendra. She called out Excadrill to help rescue Axew from between Pendra`s horns but it stayed in its curled up drill state until after Axew was rescued. Pendra though was still raging and it kicked Excadrill and got it angry. It then drilled underneath Pendra and then set it flying.
Excadrill didn`t always want to obey Iris when its asked to do something. For awhile, it was stubborn but Iris`s Excadrill was able to overcome the feelings of resentment and lost of trust it felt from the battle against Drayden`s Haxorus. After relating her experience to Ash and Cilan, it became more clear to Iris that she was not fully understanding her Excadrill`s feelings. Iris apologized to her Excadrill as she finally realized that her Excadrill knew after the first hit during the battle against Drayden`s Haxorus that they couldn`t win against it.
Battle against Drayden`s Haxorus at Dragon Village Battle Tournament
Having watched Iris`s Excadrill battle and defeat the Trainer`s Crimgan at the battle tournament in the Dragon Village, Drayden came out of the tent to meet Iris and her Excadrill. Iris challenged Drayden to a battle and if they won the battle, it would be their 100th victory together. Drayden accepted and sent out his Haxorus. Iris`s Excadrill was no match for Drayden`s Haxorus and it was defeated with a powerful Rock Smash attack. After the battle it began to distrust Iris and hid itself in its drilling position.
Mastering Focus Blast
Iris eventually realized that her Excadrill didn`t know any moves that it could use to fight with from a distance. She also realized that if it had known one at an earlier time, they would`ve had more options on how to construct our battles and would have been better prepared against Drayden`s Haxorus which had strong counter defenses against close range attacks. The night Iris apologized to her Excadrill, it decided to go out into the forest to practice working on Focus Blast. Iris showed up and the two of them practiced all through the night until it was finally able to successfully launch the attack.
Battles against Langley`s Beartic
After Iris`s Axew was defeated by Georgia`s Beartic, Iris was confident that her Excadrill was easily strong enough to defeat Georgia`s Beartic. She called her Excadrill out to battle but it appeared in its drilling position to which Iris told Georgia that it was in that position because it needed motivation. Georgia`s Beartic quickly attacked it with a Slash attack which was more than enough motivation for it to battle. Unfortunately, it wouldn`t listen to Iris`s commands and it ended up loosing the match when Georgia`s Beartic used Rock Smash, the same move that caused it to loose its first Pokémon battle and began secluding itself.
During the rematch battle, Iris`s Excadrill listened to Iris`s commands and they were able to have a more effective battle. Georgia`s Beartic still proved to be a powerful opponent but this time the battle ended in a draw.
Donamite Tournament
Burgundy`s Dewott entered the Donamite tournament and faced Iris`s Excadrill in the first round. Iris`s Excadrill was able to defend Burgundy`s Dewott new move Ice Beam with its claws but when Iris`s Excadrill dug a hole, Burgundy`s Dewott used Water Pulse in the hole to deal some significant damage and get it back above ground. Iris`s Excadrill fought back with another violent Metal Claw attack which struck its mark and looked like it had defeated Burgundy`s Dewott. Burgundy`s Dewott had another new move up its sleeve and it got up off the ground and used Revenge. Iris`s Excadrill managed to withstand Revenge and counterattack with Dig while Burgundy`s Dewott was still recovering. Iris`s Excadrill won the match and eliminated Burgundy from the tournament.
Rematch Battle against Drayden`s Haxorus at the Soryu Gym
During the battle, Drayden was evaluating how much Iris had grown and he noticed that Iris`s Excadrill power certainly seemed to have improved. The matchup between Iris`s Excadrill and Drayden`s Haxorus ended up in a draw as the two of them knocked each other out.</description>

<description>Aloe is the Gym Leader of Shippo City Gym. Trainers that defeat her are given the Basic Badge. She met Ash and his friends at the Shippo City Museum where she arrived to help figure out the mystery behind the mysterious poltergeist that was scarring Kidachi. She agreed to battle Ash after she solved the mystery of Desumasu`s mask.
The Shippo Gym is located inside the Shippo City museum and Aloe also works as the curator of the museum itself. She runs an archive full of valuable books and research papers that ordinary people are not permitted to view without her permission. Only people who want to use it for examinations, research and Gym match challengers can use the book archive. The library in the museum that Aloe also runs has the most books in the Isshu region.
Aloe tests her challengers as soon as they enter the archive area. She suggests a book to each of them that leads them straight to the underground battlefield but most decide to read up on a subject they are proficient despite the fact that she is actually showing them the shortest route to the Gym. Ash straightforwardness did exactly as Aloe suggested and he picked the book that she suggested, revealing the stairs to the gym right away. Most challengers read too much into her actions and end up taking a detour.
In her first match against Ash she defeated him by studying him and getting to know his tenancies. She revealed her two Pokémon, Aloe`s Yorterry and Aloe`s Miruhog before the match so he could study them as well. In the end, Aloe`s studying of Ash proved to be the turning point in the match and she was able to defeat him. She told Ash to return and battle her again though.</description>

It was able to help get the mask off of Dent and help discover that the poltergeist was a Desumasu that dropped its mask when it was sleeping. Kidachi stated that Miruhog is an amazing Pokémon that is very obedient to Aloe and helps guards the museum.
During the first gym battle against Ash`s Oshawott, it used Mean Look so Ash`s Oshawott couldn`t be switched out. Since Ash`s Oshawott wasn`t expecting to battle Aloe`s Miruhog at that time, it was at a disadvantage and it was in a bad mood. Dent stated during the battle that Aloe`s Miruhog was brilliant at making use of stillness and motion. After Ash`s Oshawott lost its shell during the battle, Aloe`s Miruhog was able to use its Thunderbolt effectively to knock Ash`s Oshawott out of the match.</description>

It appears once more in "Rematch at the Nacrene Gym!", where it is defeated by Oshawott`s Aqua Jet.
Game Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava described Watchog as a "pissed-off meerkat", and further calling it a "disgruntled-looking jerk". An editor for GamesRadar included it in a satirical character battle between their "ultimate hated characters".</description>

<description>Hydreigon, known as the Brutal Pokémon, is the evolution of Zweilous, and final stage of Deino. Hydreigon is a three-headed bipedal dragon with six wings. It is extremely vicious and destructive as it travels the skies, attacking anything that moves. Its duplicate heads do not have brains, but are used to eat and attack.
Hydreigon appears in the Nintendo 3DS download Pokédex 3D, where it was featured as one of the first collectible Pokémon. A Hydreigon under the ownership of Carlita appeared in Pokémon the Movie: Black - Victini and Reshiram and White - Victini and Zekrom. It appears to have shiny coloration in the White version of the film, while being normal colored in the Black version.
Official Nintendo Magazine`s Chris Schilling used Hydreigon as an example of a unique Pokémon in this generation compared to the safer ones earlier in the game.</description>

<description>Ash met Kikuyo who runs a Pokémon Day Care near Shippo City where she watches over Pokémon eggs. As thanks for helping out her granddaughter Yuri (Isshu) sort out her kindergarten class, she gave Ash a Pokémon egg. Kikuyo told Ash to raise it well so that it would be a great Pokémon. That Pokémon egg later hatched into Ash`s Zuruggu while Ash was en-route to Castelia City.
While resting, Iris`s Kibago noticed that the egg was beginning to glow but got too excited and caused the egg to fall down the nearby cliff and almost get smashed by a rock. Thankfully, Pikachu`s Quick Attack was fast enough to rescue the egg in time. After hatching, Ash`s Zuruggu`s initial attitude was very overbearing as Pikachu attempted to greet it but it used headbutt on Pikachu. Ash then sent out his other Pokémon but Ash`s Zuruggu ended up fighting them as well. Ash tried to capture it after battling his other Pokémon but it refused to be caught by him at that time.
After its encounter with a group of Dentula, Ash`s other Pokémon came to Ash`s Zuruggu rescue as it was greatly over matched. Ash could tell that it was beginning to trust him. Dent then suggested that Ash`s Zuruggu battle Iris`s Kibago as all the other Pokémon were too strong. Both Pokémon agreed but they ended up knocking each other out at the same time. Ash`s Zuruggu was finally caught after the battle as it had grown to like Ash.</description>

Upon passing the test she decided to challenge Cilan at the Sanyo Gym for the Tri Badge. Cilan defeated her but when Cabernet returned to challenge Cilan at the gym, Chili and Cress had to explain that Cilan was on a journey and was no longer at the gym. Angry that Cilan was not the gym leader when she visited, she battled at the gym anyhow and won the Tri Badge.
Ash met her at a new Friendly Shop while on his way to Hiun City. Cabernet did a compatibility test for all of Ash`s Pokémon but she gave him low compatibility for all his Pokémon. Ash and his Pokémon were not impressed with her compatibility test skills. Cilan and Iris interrupted the compatibility test only for Cabernet to realize that she had finally found Cilan and she was now out for revenge.
Cabernet challenged Cilan to a revenge battle where she ended up loosing to him yet again. More angry than ever, she vowed to defeat Cilan the next time they met while becoming an S-class Sommelière and she took off.</description>

Iris and friends first encountered it when Iris`s Axew lost one of the apples it was eating and chased it down the hill. Iris ran after get Kibago only to come across the Emonga who had picked up the apple Iris`s Axew was chasing after. Iris`s Emolga noticed that Iris was carrying a lot more apples and realized that if it returned the one apple to Iris`s Axew that Iris might reward it by giving it a lot more of the apples she was carrying.
Bianca who was with Iris and friends at the time, quickly fell in love with the Emonga and wanted to catch it but after an uncomfortable hug, Emonga quickly learned that it didn`t want to be caught by Bianca and it shocked her. Still determined to capture it, Bianca followed it for a while until Emonga finally made its intentions clear that it wanted to be caught by Iris. Iris`s Emolga jumped into Iris`s arms and then allowed itself to be caught by her Poké Ball.

Kenyan was a bit annoyed by the fact that Ash couldn`t pronounce his name correctly even after repetitively telling him the correct way to say it.
Kenyan sent out his Blitzle to battle Ash`s Oshawott. He was a bit surprised that Ash sent out a Water type Pokémon against him even though he knew that his Blitzle was an Electric type. Kenyan was a bit surprised by Ash`s Oshawott`s scallsword defense but he quickly changed tactics a Ash`s Oshawott ended up loosing his scallsword. Ash called time out on their battle and Cilan rescheduled the battle till the next day. Kenyan camped out for the night nearby.
In the rematch battle, Kenyan had powered up his Blitzle by using his own power-generating equipment that he made to inject the power into Blitzle. Even after being powered up, Kenyan`s Blitzle lost to Ash`s Oshawott. Kenyan vowed to get stronger and have a rematch with Ash someday.</description>

Don George Tournament - Raimon Town
Luke`s Larvesta battled against Cilan`s Stunfisk in the second round of the Don Battles Tournament in Raimon Town. Luke`s Larvesta used String Shot as an attack and a defense in the battle which showed Cilan that Luke knew how to battle with his Larvesta. When Cilan`s Stunfisk was wrapped up with String Shot, Cilan allowed it to get hit by Flamethrower to set it loose. Luke`s Larvesta ended up defeating Cilan`s Stunfisk with a powerful Flamethrower though which eliminated Cilan from the tournament.
Battle against Skyla
Skyla`s Swoobat was matched up against Cilan`s Stunfisk in Skyla`s air battle and she believed that her Swoobat would be victorious. In the actual gym battle, Cilan`s Crustle was replaced by Cilan`s Stunfisk to determine the winner of the match after it was defeated by Skyla`s Swanna. Cilan`s Stunfisk started off with a Thundershock but Skyla`s Swanna shook it off fairly easily and Skyla chastened Cilan by saying that it would take at least a Thunderbolt to affect her Swanna. Skyla`s Swanna countered with a Hurricane whic tossed Cilan`s Stunfisk into the air but wasn`t too effective against it as its actually quite mobile in the air. Cilan`s Stunfisk then used Scald which also burned Skyla`s Swanna. It appeared that Skyla`s Swanna was nearing defeat but it used Aqua Ring to heal itself and then attacked with a powerful Brave Bird and knocked out Cilan`s Stunfisk to give Skyla the victory in the match.</description>

<description>Ash realized that only one of his Pokémon would be able to endure the attacks from Clay`s Excadrill and keep enduring them until there was a chance to counterattack and that was Ash`s Roggenrola. Ash`s Roggenrola kept on enduring all the attacks for quite awhile until it evolved into Ash`s Boldore. After evolving it learned two new moves and it became even stronger than when it was a Roggenrola. The battle then turned into a frontal power match between two Pokémon with strong bodies and Ash`s Roggenrola was able to counterattack against Clay`s Excadrill. Clay`s Excadrill was unable to match the power of Ash`s Roggenrola`s Rock Smash and Clay`s Excadrill was knocked out giving Ash the overall victory in the gym battle.
Tag Battle VS Bianca and Professor Juniper
After Bianca`s Shelmet and Professor Juniper`s Karrablast evolved via link trade, Professor Juniper suggested to Bianca that they team up and have a tag battle against Ash and Cilan. Ash`s Boldore and Cilan`s Crustle had recently evolved so they decided to use them against Bianca`s Escavalier and Professor Juniper`s Accelgor. The beginning of the battle went well for Bianca and Professor Juniper as Bianca`s Escavalier`s Fury Attack was excellent but Bianca hadn`t commanded it to use it. Realizing that Bianca`s Escavalier wasn`t following commands, Ash and Cilan decided to focus their attacks on it. Professor Juniper`s Accelgor managed to protect Bianca`s Escavalier as Professor Juniper explained that tag battles were all about teamwork. Professor Juniper`s Accelgor lost a lot of stamina defending Bianca`s Escavalier after it used Substitute and Bianca`s Escavalier finally realized that it needed to listen to Bianca otherwise it would loose the battle. After Professor Juniper`s Accelgor did a quick Recover, Professor Juniper`s Accelgor and Bianca`s Escavalier started working together and they combined their Hyper Beam attacks which knocked out Ash`s Boldore. Cilan`s Crustle fought back with its powerful Rock Wrecker to knock out both Bianca`s Escavalier and Professor Juniper`s Accelgor and give Ash and Cilan the tag battle win.</description>

At the beginning of the battle, Clay`s Krokorok had the upper hand as its Sandstorm managed to get sand in Ash`s Oshawott`s eyes and it also made it harder for Ash`s Oshawott to accurately attack. Clay`s Krokorok managed to hit Ash`s Oshawott with a Bite and a Stone Edge attack but it wasn`t enough to knock it out. Ash`s Oshawott used Water Gun to clear up the Sandstorm and then it began its counterattack. Clay`s Krokorok was repetitively hit with multiple attacks from Ash`s Oshawott including a super effective Aqua Jet and Razor Shell combo that ended up being too much for it and it was knocked out.</description>

Battle against Skyla
Skyla`s Swanna was matched up against Cilan`s Crustle in Skyla`s air battle and she believed that her Swanna would be victorious. In the actual gym battle, Cilan`s Pansage was replaced by Cilan`s Crustle after it was knocked out and Skyla`s Swoobat was one hit knocked out by Cilan`s Crustle`s Rock Wrecker. Skyla`s Swoobat was then replaced by Skyla`s Unfezant. It didn`t fare too well against Cilan`s Crustle as Rock Wrecker hit its mark once again. Skyla`s Unfezant`s Air Slash then proved to be ineffective against Cilan`s Crustle rock. Skyla`s Unfezant was then knocked out by a combination of Cilan`s Crustle`s Shell Smash and X-Scissor to give Cilan the lead in the battle.
Skyla`s Unfezant was then replaced by Skyla`s Swanna and the match-up from Skyla`s air battle would actually take place. Despite Skyla believing that she could defeat Cilan`s Crustle by using BubbleBeam in her air battle, it didn`t prove too effective in the actual battle as Cilan`s Crustle tried to protect itself by hiding in its rock shell. Cilan`s Crustle then went on the offensive and jumped out of its shell to do another Shell Smash/X-Scissor combo, but Skyla saw it coming this time and Skyla`s Swanna countered it with a Brave Bird and knocked it out.</description>

<description>Skyla is the Gym Leader of Mistralton Gym and those that defeat her in battle are given the Jet Badge. Her grandfather explained to Ash and his friends that Skyla is such an amazing battler that challengers from all over the Unova region came flooding in to battle her but she became so busy that she couldn`t fly her beloved airplanes any longer. She then devised air battles to save her time battling against all the challengers as she efficiently judged the challengers and their Pokémon by doing simulated battles in her head. If they won the simulation, she would award them the badge.
Gym Battle against Cilan
After watching Skyla perform `air battles`, Cilan got very upset that she was not actually doing the battles and he challenged her to a battle. Cilan agreed to do an `air battle` with her and she determined that he would loose the battle against her with the Pokémon he had chosen to battle her with. Cilan though wanted to have a real battle with her a he explained to her that with Pokémon battle, like any meal, must be tasted first before people can be certain to know anything. Skyla agreed and Cilan thought that he would be able to show her up by defeating her in a real battle and showing how her `air battles` are flawed. Unfortunately Cilan ended up loosing to Skyla but Ash challenged her to a battle right after.
Gym Battle against Ash
After the crowd and her grandfather convinced her to battle against Ash, Skyla did an air battle against Ash`s selected Pokémon and she said she`d beat him. Ash wanted to battle her right away after hearing that but she told him she`d battle him at noon the next day. Ash was able to prove to Skyla the efforts of a Trainer and their Pokémon can bring about unexpected developments that her air battles couldn`t account for. She then agreed to do proper Gym battles instead of air battles from that point on.</description>

<description>After Ash`s Tranquill replaced Pikachu in the final match-up in the gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was overpowered by Skyla`s Swanna`s Hurricane and was knocked down hard to the ground. Ash`s Unfezant then evolved from Ash`s Tranquill and proved it was stronger and faster than Skyla`s Swanna.
Gym Battle against Skyla`s Swanna
Ash dex and Cilan both noted that Ash`s Unfezant was female so it should be able to match or even surpass Swanna`s flying abilities. It also learned the new move Aerial Ace. After a short battle based on speed and air maneuvers, Ash`s Unfezant used its new move Aerial Ace and managed to catchup and hit Skyla`s Swanna in the air. The direct hit proved to be too much for it it and Skyla`s Swanna was knocked out and Ash ended up the overall victor of the gym battle. Ash`s Unfezant proved that it evolving brought in an unexpected element that Skyla could never have predicted in her air battle simulations.</description>

Cilan`s Crustle then went on the offensive and jumped out of its shell to do another Shell Smash/X-Scissor combo, but Skyla saw it coming this time and Skyla`s Swanna countered it with a Brave Bird and knocked it out.
Cilan`s Crustle was then replaced by Cilan`s Stunfisk to determine the winner of the match. Cilan`s Stunfisk started off with a Thundershock but Skyla`s Swanna shook it off fairly easily and Skyla chastened Cilan by saying that it would take at least a Thunderbolt to affect her Swanna. Skyla`s Swanna countered with a Hurricane whic tossed Cilan`s Stunfisk into the air but wasn`t too effective against it as its actually quite mobile in the air. Cilan`s Stunfisk then used Scald which also burned Skyla`s Swanna. It appeared that Skyla`s Swanna was nearing defeat but it used Aqua Ring to heal itself and then attacked with a powerful Brave Bird and knocked out Cilan`s Stunfisk to give Skyla the victory in the match.
Battle against Ash
Just after Pikachu ended up knocking out Skyla`s Unfezant, Skyla`s Swanna was sent out to battle against it. Skyla had been watching her grandpa`s battle videos and noticed that he used the move Aqua Ring to defend against Electric attacks. She used that same defense against Pikachu which nullified its Electric attacks. It`s Iron Tail also couldn`t hit it so high in the air. Ash then noticed the rings in the air and Pikachu jumped up on them and managed to hit Skyla`s Swanna but not directly. Pikachu was now up in the air though and Skyla`s Swanna had the advantage there and it quickly knocked Pikachu out with a powerful Brave Bird attack.
After Ash`s Tranquill replaced Pikachu in the final match-up in the gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was overpowered by Skyla`s Swanna`s Hurricane and was knocked down hard to the ground. Ash`s Tranquill then evolved into Ash`s Unfezant and proved it was stronger and faster than Skyla`s Swanna. Ash dex and Cilan both noted that Ash`s Unfezant was female so it should be able to match or even surpass Swanna`s flying abilities. It also learned the new move Aerial Ace. After a short battle based on speed and air maneuvers, Ash`s Unfezant used its new move Aerial Ace and managed to catchup and hit Skyla`s Swanna in the air. The direct hit proved to be too much for it it and Skyla`s Swanna was knocked out and Ash ended up the overall victor of the gym battle. Ash`s Unfezant proved that it evolving brought in an unexpected element that Skyla could never have predicted in her air battle simulations.</description>

<description>While at the Astilbe Town Pokémon Center, Ash`s Tepig noticed Suwama and came up to it. After talking with Ash and his friends, he realized that this was the Tepig he`d let go. Ash wanted to prove to Suwama that Tepig was a strong Pokémon and they decided to have a battle with Ash`s Tepig as the focus. During the battle, Ash`s Tepig evolved into Ash`s Pignite. After Ash`s Pignite defeated Suwama, Suwama realized how much stronger Ash`s Pignite had become and he tried to get it to join him again thinking that it would want to rejoin him despite the fact that he had rejected him a second time the day before. Ash`s Pignite pretended that he was interested for a few moments before blowing fire into Suwama`s face. Suwama ran off in psychotic pain while telling Ash`s Pignite to remember him.
Gym Battle against Brycen
Ash`s Pignite was then sent out to battle Brycen`s Cryogonal and like Ash`s Scraggy, it had a hard time attacking and defending against Rapid Spin. The Rapid Spin was strengthened to ward off and mitigate disadvantageous moves and Brycen countermeasures were almost perfect. It wasn`t until Ash realized they could use Fire Pledge at the center of the rotation of Rapid Spin to knock it off. The strategy worked and Brycen`s Cryogonal was knocked out.
Brycen`s Beartic replaced Brycen`s Cryogonal and Ash`s Pignite quickly found itself being outmatched despite the type advantage. Brycen`s Beartic used Brine and Aerial Ace to quickly knock Ash`s Pignite out.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Pinot Noir is the other A-class Pokémon Sommelier other than Cilan that Hattori invited to be brought to his house so that they could determine which Pokémon would be best for Momotchi first Pokémon. Pinot Noir described himself as having outstanding intelligence, stamina, observing eyes and expressiveness. He already had heard about Cilan and how he was an excellent Pokémon Sommelier despite his young age. Pinot Noir appears to be middle aged and has had a lot of experience as being a Pokémon Sommelier.
During his tasting time, Pinot Noir determined that what is important for a first Pokémon is the coordination with its Trainer and that a marriage in which each makes the other look cuter and more beautiful would be ideal. He believed that Tuline was the most suitable candidate for Momotchi as the prettiness unique to Grass types, the cute appearance and the possibility of a gorgeous evolution were all perfectly suited for her. Cilan didn`t completely disagree with Pinot Noir`s choice though but he sensed that it wasn`t a perfect selection.
Pokémon battle vs Cilan
Despite their disagreement, Hattori suggested the two have a Pokémon battle to determine which A-class Pokémon Sommelier would get to choose the Pokémon for Momotchi. The battle was a 1-on-1 affair and Pinot Noir`s Purrloin was sent out to face Cilan`s Crustle. Pinot Noir said his Choroneko`s speed and power even surpasses its evolved form Lepardas. During the battle, Pinot Noir noted that Cilan`s Crustle was a good choice for Cilan in that it`s faithful to the basics but that alone was nothing but an ordinary and boring tasting. He expanded by saying that selecting Iwapalace, who is both a Rock and a Bug type, against Choroneko, a Dark type, is a standard reaction. He suggested to Cilan that an A-class Sommelier needed to have more unpredictability which Cilan`s Crustle showed by coming out of its shell and using Rock Wrecker to defeat Pinot Noir`s Purrloin. Pinot Noir admitted that Cilan`s Crustle hid an unexpected flavor.
When Cilan chose Tamagetake as Momotchi partner, he initially thought that fashion-wise, they weren`t really a match but after he saw the bond between the two he admitted that he lost the tasting compatibility to Cilan but vowed to beat him the next time they met.</description>

It wasn`t until Iris heard about the situation and realized that it was injured and she tried to protect it. Cilan, Ash and Dawn found a video camera that recorded the battle between Dragonite and Hydreigon to show to Officer Jenny who then backed off when she realized that it really was injured.
Dragonite was taken to Nurse Joy (Isshu) who helped heal its injuries and was free to go. Just as it was leaving, it turned back to look at Iris and Cilan realized that it wanted to stay with Iris then caught the Roughneck Dragonite.</description>

Alexa had told Ash and his friends about an old legend on Harvest Island where there was plenty of fruit and the people lived prosperously. But eventually, everyone wanted to eat even more delicious fruit and to claim them as their own that it led to fights breaking out. The forest gradually got ruined due to the war and there were no more fruit to pick any more. Before long, two powerful Pokémon fought for the last fruit. The two Pokémon fought harshly, but ran out of strength before the fight could be decided. Just then, a boy from the village ran up to them and gave them pieces of fruit, saying, "It`s more tasty if you share it with others". And so, the forest returned to its former state and continued to produce delicious fruit. The prize for winning the Pokémon Sumo was a bunch of fruit which Ash shared to the people at the festival. He then shared a fruit with Yukiya to try to mend the argument and rivalry they previously had.</description>

<description>In ancient times, a peaceful island in the Decolora Archipelago was suddenly attacked by a group of Pokémon. A man named Woodate arrived on the island from across the ocean. To save the people who were exhausted from the Pokémon`s assaults, Woodate skillfully led the Pokémon to the summit of the mountain. And then, when he held up his hand to the night sky upon his arrival at the summit, A comet emitting dazzling light appeared, illuminating the earth. It was as if Woodate had predicted the appearance of the comet; the Pokémon became rooted to the spot, calmed their rage and submitted to him. And so, peace returned to the island.
Afterwards, Woodate remained on the island with the Pokémon and Trainers who heard of him gathered from all regions to challenge him. On the battlefield built on the summit of the mountain, Woodate displayed excellent battles and didn`t lose even once, it`s said.
The people of the island called him a hero and called the comet that appears every 10-odd years the "Woodate Comet" to praise his achievements.</description>

<description>Tony is a young boy that lives with his parents on an island in the Decolora archipelago. While walking near the Pokémon Center, he met Alexa`s Gogoat and he touched its horns. Alexa`s Gogoat is able to sense the strong feelings of those who touch its horns. Sensing that Tony wanted to visit his father, Alexa`s Gogoat motioned for Tony to ride on it so they could go to the mountain observatory where his father worked.
Tony`s Mother was upset because her son Tony was missing. Officer Jenny (Isshu) said there had been reports that a Pokémon uncommon in the area was walking with a boy looking like Tony on its back. Tony`s Mother explained that he might have gone to the observatory as her husband works there and it`s his birthday. She continued by saying Tony was excited to celebrate it with him and even prepared a present but her husband had to stay overnight at the observatory and couldn`t come home. Officer Jenny instructed Tony`s Mother to stay at home in case he returned there.
Thankfully with the help of Ash and his friends, they were able to find Tony and make sure he got to his father despite being told it was a dangerous journey to come visit him on his own.</description>

<description>Morana is a trainer that traveled to the Isshu region from the Sinnoh region to close down the Sanyo Gym. She takes pleasure in humiliating gym leaders by forcing them to battle with her and accept unreasonable offers to shut down their gyms.
She challenged Chili and Cress and defeated them both but they didn`t close down the gym as they told her about their brother Cilan who was also a gym leader. She tracked down Cilan and challenged him also. Cilan`s marriage with his Yanappu proved to be a powerful combination and they defeated Morana to nullify her attempt to close down the gym. She vowed that the next time she met Cilan, she would make sure that she defeated him.</description>

<description>Morana`s Abomasnow was first seen stirring up trouble when Cilan`s Pansage tried to share some fruit with it but threw a punch at it instead. Morana said that it was punishment for approaching her Yukinooh so carelessly but Cilan`s Pansage was trying to be kind and wanted to share.
Yukinooh`s Ability is Snow Warning but despite the type disadvantage, Cilan`s Pansage`s sense of unity with Cilan proved to be the deciding factor in the match. Morana`s Abomasnow lost the match against Cilan`s Pansage but Morana vowed that the next time they met, she`d make sure to win.</description>
