<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="369649">Apart from a couple of arcs (especially the last arc), this show was nothing special. Animation was nice, soundtrack was good. Watch if you`re a fan of loli-detective type anime so popular nowadays.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="261826">The problem on this one isn`t the story at all but the length on how many episodes have aired.

It isn`t great nor that bad either, and to be honest it`s a recommendable one, for those who are annoyed due to lack of episodes, there`s always a manga/LN for it to be continued.

Recommended for anime lovers who wanted some mystery and eye-candy animation.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="353303">Quite enjoyed it, good setting, interesting arcs, looked and sounded good. Characters where pretty standard but blander versions of themselves which kind of fit in better with the setting I felt.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="654581">There is nothing i can say that will convey how good this anime you just need to see it :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="485775">very interesting, good stories, i am really enjoying this series.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="94967">If you like anime about street life and crime that features teens as the the primary cast and is not all down to earth (or bottom of the bay, if you like), this show is for you. The TV adaptation actually made considerable changes compared to light novels, mainly to tone down content that was already daring for print but this was done not merely by the way of blatant censorship but also by twisting timeline of events. Unusually this created almost but not entirely two parallel timelines that each have their strong and weak points meaning that you`ll get something slightly different from each of the two media.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on http://anidb.net/cr24601 [Sugii Hikaru]`s mystery light novel series Kamisama no Memo-chou (God`s Notebook).
http://anidb.net/ch30967 [Fujishima Narumi] is a high school student who is not very involved in his school, to the point where he does not know most of his classmates` names. However, in a chain of events, he is pulled into participating in his school`s Gardening Committee whose members consist of himself and classmate http://anidb.net/ch30966 [Shinozaki Ayaka]. He also gets dragged in as a member of NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training), an amateur detective agency filled with unemployed slack-offs who take on and solve cases on their own whims.
The NEET agency is led by http://anidb.net/ch30960 [Alice], a childish, anti-social, extreme shut-in. This is to the point where she never leaves her room filled with computer monitors and stuffed animals. Alice has proven herself a resourceful hacker and an astounding detective, though. Narumi, accompanied by the other members of NEET, solve crimes and murders using their limited resources and Alice`s genius intellect.

<name>detective</name>
<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.

<name>reverse trap</name>
<description>A reverse trap is a plot device where a female character is mistaken for a male, with the intention of sexually deceiving other characters and/or the viewer. This behavior does not need to be intentional by the female (it is often not intentional) or continually maintained by the female, but the occurrence is common enough to deserve this fetish-specific tag.
This is often achieved by portraying the female character as a male; primarily via their clothing and physical appearance, but also through her behaviour, and/or language. A female character misinterpreted by others as male, without action from the female (explicitly masculine dress or behaviour), is generally not considered a reverse trap; instead they are likely just http://anidb.net/t2561 [androgynous].
The reverse case is known as a http://anidb.net/t618 [trap].</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>violent retribution for accidental infringement</name>
<description>A comedy / slapstick element often found in Ecchi anime: The hilarity derives from spontaneous embarrassment, overreaction of the "victim" (girl), immediate retribution for a seemingly inappropriate act, and a sense of pity with the supposed "aggressor" (boy).
Typically a boy will - through no fault of his own - stumble into a girl, thus invading her personal space. In the process the boy may e.g. pull down her skirt, grab the girl`s breasts, or accidentally kiss her. Any level-headed girl would see the accident just for what it is. Not so the girl with an overly developed sense of modesty, and a thing for violence. She - often a tsundere - will clobber the boy with excessive brutality.</description>

<description>A mafia is a type of organized crime syndicate whose primary activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions. Secondary activities may be practiced such as gambling, drug trafficking, loan sharking, and fraud. The term was originally applied to the Sicilian mafia, but has since expanded to encompass other organizations of similar methods and purpose, such as in "the Russian mafia" or "the Japanese mafia", and is applied informally by the press and public, but the criminal organizations themselves have their own terms; for example, the original Sicilian and Italian-American mafia call themselves "cosa nostra", while the Japanese mafia calls itself "yakuza".

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>school life</name>
<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

It is a shady world, unknown to most people, where illegal things like murder, smuggling, drug dealing and similar are happening daily. Groups known to be acting in this world are for example the mafia or the yakuza.</description>

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>ohanami</name>
<description>Hanami (花見, lit. "flower viewing") is the Japanese traditional custom of enjoying the beauty of flowers, "flower" in this case almost always meaning cherry blossoms or ume blossoms. 
From the end of March to early May, sakura bloom all over Japan, and around the first of February on the island of Okinawa. The blossom forecast (桜前線 sakurazensen, literally cherry blossom front) is announced each year by the weather bureau, and is watched carefully by those planning hanami as the blossoms only last a week or two. 
In modern-day Japan, hanami mostly consists of having an outdoor party beneath the sakura during daytime or at night. Hanami at night is called yozakura (夜桜, literally night sakura).

<summary>Narumi’s new to Tokyo and it doesn’t take him long to get lost in the big city. He somehow manages to stumble into the red district, where he sees a girl jump out of a second-floor window. A group of teenagers help her and her friend, but no one is open to answering any of Narumi’s questions.  The next day at school Ayaka, one of Narumi’s classmates, forces him to join her Garden Club. After school she takes him over to a ramen shop, where she introduces him to her friends—the same guys he saw the other day! Apparently they’re a group of NEETs that like to help out the NEET detective, Alice.  Alice has received a request to put an end to a prostitution spree, but before she can do that she must find a prostitute that has gone missing. Somehow the girl Narumi saw jump out of the window is related to the case. Can Narumi help Alice find the girl before this case gets carried away?</summary>

<summary>Since Meo used the phone at Hanamaru’s to call her dad’s cell, the yakuza now knows where she is. Some of Mikawa’s men go roughen Min and her ramen joint up a bit in an attempt to convince her to hand the Thai girl over, but Min’s one tough cookie. Meo overhears the struggle and decides to run away and handle things on her own.  Unfortunately, things don’t go well for Meo and it’s up to Narumi and the Hirasaka Gang to rescue her. Narumi realizes that the only way he’ll be able to truly help Meo and her father is to join the Hirasaka brotherhood. Although the Fourth isn’t willing to accept Narumi into his gang, he is willing to welcome him into the family.  Now that Narumi has a strong ally behind him, he’s willing to take some dangerous risks. But will his outrageous plan be enough to trick the yakuza and rescue Meo’s dad?</summary>

<summary>After a strange phone call, Meo’s father has gone missing. Her only clue is a heavy bag he’s entrusted her with. Desperate to find her father, Meo goes to Alice for help. When Narumi and the NEETs hear that her father used to be a money-launder for the yakuza, everyone is convinced her father took off.  But things aren’t quite matching up. Meo only has 200 million yen out of the supposed 300 million, so where is the missing money? And if he was going to run off, why didn’t he take Meo with him?  Just after Narumi confronts Meo about how her father probably bailed out on her, Alice finds a new clue. Could this point to her father’s innocence?</summary>
