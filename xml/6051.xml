<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="288344">I`m a Higurashi fan though,&lt;br /&gt;I`ve feel down for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;waiting next season for things not come to be all magic. still had hopes.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="188990">Ok to sum it up arc wise: 1st - wow I love it it`s awesome, 2nd - well it`s good, 3rd - errr what is this? 4th = wtf have I just watched.
So if you wanna enjoy yourself skip the 2nd half of the anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="516857">First of all, DO NOT compare Umineko to Higurashi, the only connection between two of the is from sam company maker 07th Expansion, and refrenced some of Higurashi chara and model, (if interested read the wiki).

2nd, although it has abit of poor drawing, still i can say it has good music.

3rd, again with a bit of advice, watch the anime, get confused, play all their games and read the guide, then it will cure your confusing mind.

At last, it`s only and adaptation with better drawing quality than their VN, (search for them, you`d be suprised).</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="622708">I haven`t played the game, nor I particularly like magic (as a matter of fact I dislike magical themes), and let`s add to that that nor the story has any coherence to it, however despite all of that it`s a really good watch, more like a nightmarish ride, wherein one should suspend all logic and simply go with the flow.

The logic behind the story is actually quite straightforward: this is a battle of "wits", where the protagonist must conquer his own feelings (that is, beliefs) and defy magic at any cost, in order to win.

Those who are looking for a coherence within given arguments are just missing the point, while this has really nothing to with being a coherent and logical story, but an exertion to not give up at any cost and keep "defying" and "denying" this ghastly opponent.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="288423">EXCEPT THE GOOD ANIMATION AND GRAPHIC IT IS
One of the stupidest anime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="375849">Series is separated into several parts,with each one featuring a different version of the incident happening at the island. Though,said that,it`s different from Higurashi,so you shouldn`t expect it to be exactly like that. Well,it`s really worth watching,as it drowns in while watching it! After finishing one episode,you just want to see the next ep for some reason :D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="419078">People are saying don`t expect Higurashi, they`re right because it is much much better than that. Though DEEN did some production mistakes, but still it is much more conceptual, philosophical and psychological than Higurashi. I really appreciate Ryukishi`s work. Anime Rating - 8/10, Game (or Visual Novel) Rating - 10/10.</recommendation>

<name>insane</name>
<description>Insanity, craziness, or madness is a spectrum of behaviors characterized by certain abnormal mental or behavioral patterns. Insanity may manifest as violations of societal norms, including a person becoming a danger to themselves or others, though not all such acts are considered insanity; likewise, not all acts showing indifference toward societal norms are acts of insanity.
In modern usage, insanity is most commonly encountered as an informal unscientific term denoting mental instability, or in the narrow legal context of the insanity defense.
A more informal use of the term insanity is to denote something or someone considered highly unique, passionate or extreme, including in a positive sense. The term may also be used as an attempt to discredit or criticise particular ideas, beliefs, principles, desires, personal feelings, attitudes, or their proponents, such as in politics and religion.

<name>detective</name>
<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<name>violent retribution for accidental infringement</name>
<description>A comedy / slapstick element often found in Ecchi anime: The hilarity derives from spontaneous embarrassment, overreaction of the "victim" (girl), immediate retribution for a seemingly inappropriate act, and a sense of pity with the supposed "aggressor" (boy).
Typically a boy will - through no fault of his own - stumble into a girl, thus invading her personal space. In the process the boy may e.g. pull down her skirt, grab the girl`s breasts, or accidentally kiss her. Any level-headed girl would see the accident just for what it is. Not so the girl with an overly developed sense of modesty, and a thing for violence. She - often a tsundere - will clobber the boy with excessive brutality.</description>

<name>magic circles</name>
<description>A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised.
Traditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for non-magical work such as meditation.
Generally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names.

<description>The two terms are similar yet different, however, the fact that they look and `feel` the same outweighs the technical differences. For clarification, visual novels are considered a sub-genre of adventure games and the term does not cover simulations. While the two genres often share a common visual presentation, dating sims are sometimes considered to be more statistically based than the "choose your own adventure" style of visual novels; basically, the choices you make might change something else than just the story arc (or your next porn pic). Dating sims can involve several technical elements such as a time limit, several statistics such as looks and charm which can be boosted through exercise, or an "attraction meter" which can increase or decrease depending on one`s decisions.</description>

<description>Asia is Earth`s largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometers, about 30% of Earth`s total land area and 8.7% of the Earth`s total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>The thriller is a genre of fiction in which tough, resourceful, but essentially ordinary heroes are pitted against villains determined to destroy them, their country, or the stability of the free world. The hero of a typical thriller faces danger alone or in the company of a small band of companions. The protagonist may be a law enforcement agent, a journalist, or a soldier, but typically he or she is cut off from the resources of "their" organization. More often the hero is an ordinary citizen drawn into danger and intrigue by circumstances beyond their control.

<description>The conspiracy thriller (or paranoid thriller) is a sub-genre of the thriller which flourished in the 1970s in the US (and was echoed in other parts of the world) in the wake of a number of high-profile scandals and controversies (most notably Vietnam, the assassination of President Kennedy, Chappaquiddick and Watergate), and which exposed what many people regarded as the clandestine machinations and conspiracies beneath the orderly fabric of political life.
The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top".</description>

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

<description>Usually metaphorical. Sometimes literal. At times both!
Typically this refers to the fact that the story is set in a grim, dog eat dog milieu — for example a decaying city.
Often the characters are just doing what they need to do to survive, with little or no expectation that their lives can be better. And often characters may feel they do not have any real choice in what they do.
And yes, occasionally the setting is actually dark — be it night or perpetually heavy cloudy sky and rain. It all adds to the oppressive, hopeless feeling of the show.

<name>gore</name>
<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

Behaviors or habits are classified under this category if they directly give birth to other immoralities.

These sins are often thought to be abuses or excessive versions of one`s natural faculties or passions (for example, gluttony abuses one`s desire to eat).

<description>A time loop is a common plot device in science fiction (especially in universes where time travel is commonplace). Events in the story repeat themselves a number of times with or without some variation with each pass. Most characters either do not realise this is occurring or are attempting to break the cycle in some way. 
One well-known example of this is in the 1993 film Groundhog Day, in which the main character is the only one aware of the time loop, although time loops had appeared in many fictional works prior to that. Stories with time loops commonly center on correcting past mistakes or on getting a character to recognise some key truth; escape from the loop may then follow.</description>

<description>Hanyuu is the mysterious "transfer student" in Matsuribayashi-hen. She has a pair of dark colored horns on her head, one of which is chipped slightly (however, no one seems to notice or mention them). In fact, she has appeared to Rika all her life, but only in Matsuribayashi-hen and Miotsukushi-hen did she gain the power to interact with others. Like many of the characters, she can be frightening when angered, and with her spirit-like nature, her appearance can change with her mood until she takes a physical form.
She is the one responsible for the eternally repeating June 1983, which she created in order to save Rika from being murdered. She is very meek and often makes the noise "Au au, au au..." when she is nervous or uncomfortable, or sometimes while trying to make a point. She dislikes alcohol and kimchi, which Rika imbibes in large amounts as punishment when she finds Hanyuu annoying (as both Hanyuu`s and Rika`s senses are linked together).</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The son of Rudolf and his previous wife, Asumu. Six years ago, he rebelled against his father who had entered his second wife in the very time he was bereaved of his mother. He went to live with his maternal grandparents. However, his grandparents died one after the other, and six years later, he has returned to the Ushiromiya family.
He is very stubborn and is afraid of "shaky" transportation, thinking he might fall off. He insists that the Golden Witch does not exist, and his denial of her existence becomes the main theme of the game.</description>

She has a habit of being very creepy at certain moments, especially with her laugh of "kihihihihihi...", and expresses some paranoia a few minutes prior to docking at the island, unnerving everyone present. This may be a result of her sensitivity to the paranormal.</description>

<description>Also known as the Witch of Miracles and greatly resembles Furude Rika from Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. Her name also suggests some connection to Rika`s "alter-ego", Frederica Bernkastel (which is hinted when Bernkastel quotes herself saying Rika`s trademark "Ni~pa" sound). It is said she resides in a world where concepts such as fate and probability can be visualised. She appears to see Beatrice`s game to ease her boredom. She assists the player by giving some hints around the workings of the game. Her "Magic of Miracles" allows her to reset a desperate situation as long as the probability of a favourable situation is not equal to zero. Like Lambdadelta, she is a Voyager: a witch able to move to the territory of other witches without losing her power. She wants Battler to win.</description>

"Lambdadelta" (λδ) represents thirty-four when using Greek numerals and "Miyo" (三四) can translated as "three, four" in Japanese. Despite that she is quite childish and holds a grudge against Bernkastel for finally beating her in their last game, she actually cares for her. She is also known as the Witch of the Absolute and The Most Powerful Witch in the Universe before losing to Bernkastel. She is the most powerful witch next to Bernkastel, and is feared by most other witches, including Beatrice. Her "Magic of Certainty" allows her to kill anyone without fail, as an absolute result. Like Bernkastel, she is a Voyager. She wants Battler and Beatrice to fight against each other for eternity.</description>

<description>The Seven Stakes of Purgatory, also known as the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, are the weapons which are said to be controlled by Beatrice. There are seven of them, named after the corresponding demons of the seven sins, and each one can gain power from said sin. The Stakes of Purgatory are described as being inescapable. Only powerful mages can control the Stakes of Purgatory, but they cannot hurt any who have not committed the sins, or have strong magical resistance. The Stakes can take on a human form and their true form, a powerful stake.
While in human form, they rely on their blades of light for offense, switching to stake form to dodge attacks and get in their opponent`s blind spot. As for their stake form, while smaller, they are many times faster and can kill by impalement. They can also bounce off walls and anything blocking their way, able to attack from any angle. However, in stake form, they are far from invincible, and can still be injured or even killed if shot by guns. In Turn of the golden witch, the Stakes of Purgatory first appeared in human form, taking the shape of young girls, each with a different personality, but all have red irises. They can be distinguished through hair styles and colors. They are used in order to accomplish Beatrice`s epitaph, but they are also Ange`s friends during her school years.</description>

<description>The six-year-old daughter of Kyrie and Rudolf, as well as Battler`s half-sister. She could not come to the island in 1986 due to a sickness. After the events of Banquet of the golden witch, she is raised by Eva after she returns alive from Rokkenjima, and studies to become the next family head. However, she is put through many hardships particularly due to Eva`s belief that her son George should have been the next head. Before her death in 1998, Eva passes down the name of "Beatrice" to Ange, who becomes the new Endless Witch. Ange attempts to commit suicide by jumping off a building so she can be with her family, but is stopped by the witch Bernkastel, who offers to help Ange solve the mysteries on Rokkenjima. Despite being the last witch of her time period, Ange, like Battler, does not believe in witches. However, she does understand witches along with their strengths and weaknesses, making her denial of witches very dangerous to them.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A stuffed animal resembling a lion cub handmade by Rosa, who gave it to Maria for her birthday. Maria managed to give Sakutarou a soul through magic, and since then, he became Maria`s best friend. Though Maria sees him as being able to talk freely, everyone else sees it as Maria merely speaking through a toy. His human form resembles a young boy with blond hair, and wears a yellow sweater with overly-long sleeves and a tail, a red scarf, and a cap with lion ears. His name was originally intended to be "Sakura", named after a parody of the manga and anime Cardcaptor Sakura, but since "Sakura" is traditionally a female name, Maria derived from it and added the male suffix "tarou".
He was destroyed by Rosa during a fight with Maria prior to the main events of the series and, due to Rosa`s refusal to accept him afterwards and her own subsequent deaths in 1986, it is impossible for Beatrice to revive him. However, Sakutarou is later miraculously revived by Ange.</description>
