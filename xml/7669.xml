<name>horny nosebleed</name>
<description>In Japanese media, healthy young men who have no other sexual outlet will often suffer nosebleeds upon seeing the naked female body, or even just a pair of well-filled panties.
The nosebleed is, of course, a visual shorthand/euphemism for sexual arousal. It is commonly interpreted that way for males and females, with little trickles of blood indicating mild arousal, and gushing fountains of blood indicating erection/extreme arousal in both sexes. It can also be interpreted as shorthand strictly for erections in males. In that case, when blood shoots from the nose explosively, and in ridiculous quantity, the implication would be an ejaculation.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>violent retribution for accidental infringement</name>
<description>A comedy / slapstick element often found in Ecchi anime: The hilarity derives from spontaneous embarrassment, overreaction of the "victim" (girl), immediate retribution for a seemingly inappropriate act, and a sense of pity with the supposed "aggressor" (boy).
Typically a boy will - through no fault of his own - stumble into a girl, thus invading her personal space. In the process the boy may e.g. pull down her skirt, grab the girl`s breasts, or accidentally kiss her. Any level-headed girl would see the accident just for what it is. Not so the girl with an overly developed sense of modesty, and a thing for violence. She - often a tsundere - will clobber the boy with excessive brutality.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>Minami Itsuki</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Minami Itsuki, known as Ikki (イッキ) by his friends, and also known as Crow, is a free spirited AT rider that has a natural affiliation for being in the sky. He is introduced to ATs by Noyamano family, whom he lives with due to his parents` deaths. He eventually forms Kogarasumaru, and takes on the Trophaeum. Ikki is often characterised as a crow due to a small crow, Kuu, using his hair as a nest.
Ikki is able to see the Wing Road, and his peers often consider him to be the best candidate to become the next Sky King. He possesses two passive traits known as Hawk Eye and Trick Pass, which allow him to easily survey an area and utilise any part of it. Both are considered attributes necessary for a candidate to be Sky King. He trains under Sora to better utilise the wind, and he eventually obtains the incomplete Wind Regalia. He is able to use it to move quickly and fly, though he is unable to properly use its destructive power.
Ikki is a very upbeat, zany person, who seemingly is as eccentric as just about everyone else in the universe of Air Gear. He delights in eating meat, a privilege he is often deprived of in the Noyamano household by his sisters. He is rash, impulsive, and determined to do everything his way, whether for good or bad. In battle he either comes off as his ordinary crazy and unpredictable personality, or his more serious, cold and steely side, which other characters has described as a rare occurrence, and as an intimidating scene. Ikki is totally hooked onto Air Trekking. He treats his ATs with care to such a standard that even his sisters feel jealous of, and his mind is constantly on Air Trekking; for example, during the Kyoto trip he fails to notice Ringo`s affection initially, deadset on figuring out a `Windmill Theory` that another Storm Rider has revealed to him as the secret behind the Rumble King. Ikki is a self-proclaimed genius and very proud of himself, in particular his fighting abilities. In truth he works very hard behind the other`s back, as is revealed when Kuu brings his friends to his secret training area, where the scars left over by his training could be seen.
Though his attitude can be described as a lowlife, suitable for his gangster-like persona, and though he likes to go around doing insanely foolish things all the time, Ikki has a tendency to think beyond others` perceivable concept and at several intervals can spout deep philosophy that more often than not will impact others. One such incident was the Pomtemkin brothers` battle, where Ikki`s plan caused an initial falling out among the Kogarasumaru, where in fact he had his own solution around that matter. Ikki, though easy to miss the obvious, can be very adept when it comes to spotting small details. In their first Parts War, he alone had noticed that Kazu`s ATs were the most worn out among them, a mark of how much he practised.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Ringo looks like your everyday junior high school girl. However, she is actually the successor of the legendary Storm Riders team, Sleeping Forest . She is also the current Thorn King (Queen) of the eight `Kings` in the AT world. Ringo is in love with Ikki but does not dare to tell him. She helps Kogarasumaru in times of trouble under the guise of Croissant Mask (Croissiant Kamen). Ringo is a King Class AT user. Ringo is determined to show Ikki the "fear" of flying through the air, because she doesn`t want to see him suffer the same fate the last `Wind King` did. To this end she was even willing to brutally attack him using her `Thorn Regalia`. During the battle she seems to have total control of the fight as Ikki is completely out-classed. But Kururu Sumeragi saves Ikki with a mid-air installation of the Bagram prototype cores. Ikki then becomes more than a match for Ringo. The fight then seemingly ends in a draw with Ikki carrying Ringo back home. After that battle Ikki leaves the Noyamano residence, but not before Ringo finally reveals her feeling for Ikki and kisses him goodbye. Later in the Tower of Tropheum, Killik reveals the true purpose of Ringo as leader of Sleeping Forest. Due to the final battle for the Sky King takes place where not only the air is incredibly dense, and the atmosphere is giving off the feeling of crushing you, Ringo is completely immune to it. Thus making her the perfect warrior to protect the Sky Regalia.
Ringo is often depicted to be a warrior in an armor, with a shield and blade, and a pair of wings made out of blades. At this point in her introduction, she is usually in the middle of a forest with dead bodies sprawled around her. Her introduction stays the same throughout the manga: "The Fruit of the Forbidden Forest Which Lures One into a Deep Slumber... Crazy Apple." (A play on her name since "Ringo" means Apple in Japanese.)
Ringo (along with Mikan and Ume) are not biological sisters of Rika. It was revealed in Chapter 154 by Kilik. A year or so after the creation of the original Sleeping Forest, it was revealed by Kilik that three unknown "gravity children" are staying with Rika, implying that the research for Air Treck is still going on somewhere else. In chapter 174, Ringo is seen watching Kogarasumaru training for their B-Class match against White Wolf clan, then she sees Hako talking to a mysterious girl that was seen with the Sora brothers on chapter 163.</description>

They are originally part of the Wind SWAT team, in which they are treated like a tool by their older brother, Kaito. Ikki eventually saves them, and they join Kogarasumaru. They switch who is in control by using an eye patch. Akito is innocent and non-violent. He becomes attracted to Ikki, much to Ikki`s discontent, and often tries to kiss, bathe, and sleep next to or with Ikki. He states he was the original Fang King until he became disgusted with himself and became unable to use AT. Agito then appears and starts using ATs, while following his own violent and bloodthirsty nature. He tends to swear a lot and uses four hooks dangling from straps on his legs to battle and tear people apart. When equipped with the Fang Regalia, he releases a pressurized "Fang" through the instantaneous acceleration and braking of the A-T`s wheel motors, vacuuming and compressing air into a piercing shock wave. As the manga develops, Agito grows to respect Ikki and his strength. In some scenes in the manga, Agito is shown to be very weak while sleeping, so much that the guys put him in some very humorous scenes because of his weakness. It is also learned that Akito had been acting as Agito`s tuner up until now. However, he wasn`t able to fully hear his own biorhythm, only allowing him to keep his other half`s A-T and Regalia barely operational. Because roughly 76% of the Fang Regalia was not operational, Agito had difficulty with fully utilizing his "Fangs". It isn`t until Yayoi tunes him that the Fang Regalia is fully operational and complete. Akito is very affectionate to Ikki as well as Agito to respect his way of doing things.In the manga, it is showed that Agito has some sort of affection towards Nakayama as he tells her to "protect" herself.and he has one body but two souls one with white wings and another with dark wings the dark winged one is the one with the bad attitude and he acts like a real jackass.</description>

Although shy around Ikki at first, she becomes devoted to him after witnessing his anger over Simca`s attack. Kururu may be in love with Ikki as hinted in chapter 145. She does not wear ATs, but as the leader of Tool Toul To, she is a genius in repair, construction, and maintenance of ATs. In Ikki`s battle with Ringo, Kururu identified the sound of Ikki`s ATs, arrived at the battle in time to intercept Ikki as he was falling towards the river, and rebuilt his ruined ATs in midair in less than three seconds. She originally rebuilds the Wind Regalia for him, though it is stolen and given to Sora. She eventually becomes determined to create the new Storm Regalia for him. The Pledge Regalia allows her to utilze the bodies of other tuners through the `Infinite Scale`, enabling them to build, repair, and tune ATs as quickly as the Pledge Queen.</description>

His special techniques allows him to `manipulate time` (this technique is actually just an illusion, where he moves too fast for the normal human eye, thus making him able to fool the opponent with his speed, one of these tricks being the `cloning` which is just all his afterimages) and literally marking out a `Flame Road`, where he rides his AT`s at such high speeds that the heat caused by the friction of the wheels creates the illusion of flames. These two techniques are, at some level, inherited from Yasuyoshi Sano, the Aeon Clock, and Spitfire, the former Flame King, respectively. This is highly likely, as they both followed the Flame Road.</description>

<description>Takeuchi Sora is the founder of the original Sleeping Forest, the first Wind King and the main antagonist. He is a Gravity Child who wishes to find the Sky Regalia, so he spreads the initial rumor of the Regalia`s existence and creates the team for that purpose. He is generally carefree and extremely perverted, though he is later revealed to be cold and manipulative. He is eventually betrayed by Kilik, after he finds out that Sora had ulterior motives, as he wished to use the Sky Regalia to take control of the world, and had manipulated the information on the Tower. The ensuing battle and defeat leads to his loss of the Wind Regalia and the use of his legs, as well as several defections from Sleeping Forest. He continues to use a wheelchair full-time for six years while waiting for an opportune time to put his plans into motion once again.
As the one-time leader of Sleeping Forest, he was romantically involved with Rika, a relationship which ended following Kilik`s coup d`etat that left Sora permanently using a specially customized AT-wheelchair. Sora began to mentor Ikki at the request of Rika and in the process rekindled their shattered romance. Though initially interested in grooming Ikki into an accomplished successor, Sora soon reveals Ikki is just a means to obtain a newly finished Wind Regalia and begins implementing new plans for global dominance, although it was also said that if Ikki obtained the completed wind regalia and became the wind king, he would have been a rider not even Sora could have defeated.. This turn-of-events also brought to light numerous revelations including his AT-tuned biomechatronic legs and a twin brother, Nike.</description>

As the Flame King, he can ride at such high speeds that they create the illusion of flames due to the heat caused by the friction of his wheels on the ground. He can also create the illusion of stopping time, much like Yasuyoshi Sano, one of his former subordinates. Sometime after Sleeping Forest`s defeat at the hands of Kilik he joins Genesis and becomes Simca`s close friend and advisor. He is in control of three teams and is a highly sought after hair stylist in everyday life. He begins to acknowledge Ikki after talking to Simca and witnessing some of his battles, such as the race with Buccha (whom he knew and advised well before he had any ties to Ikki and the rest of Kogarasumaru). He later takes an interest in Kazu and proclaims him to be the next Flame King after realizing the true purpose of Genesis and Takeuchi Sora and knowing that his own end might come near as a result of his betrayal. He and Sano eventually battle Sora and Nike using a combination of their styles known as the Apollo Road, though they lose and Spitfire is killed. He leaves behind the Flame Regalia and his will in the form of a video file that contains the truth about Genesis and an advanced training program that is able to recognize speech and react accordingly.</description>

At one point, she portrayed herself as Croissant Mask as an attempt to steal necessary items to create the original Storm Regalia. Ringo`s main outfit was a swimsuit, hat, cape, wig and big glasses.During the series of event, she has been forced to wear other outfits due to the outfit being stolen or destroyed.
In most recent chapters, Ringo used Croissant Mask to tell Ikki that she loved him and then passed the torch as the number one supporter to Kururu out of fear of the upcoming battle with Genesis.</description>

Using his regalia he manipulates the density in the air creating solid defensive walls that can push back his enemies, and in enclosed spaces he is able to use the echoes generated off the walls to amplify his power many times over. This helps him generate dense blasts of air to hammer at his opponents. It is called his "audience of the overroad" since the echoes respond like the audience of a crowd of tens of thousands of people. When not in use his regalia is disguised as a boom box which he carries across his shoulder.</description>

<description>The Original Sleeping Forest was supposedly created by Takeuchi Sora to protect the Trophaeum Tower from incursions by Storm Riders, but was actually a means for him to attain the Sky Regalia. To create Sleeping Forest, Sora gathered all the remaining Gravity Children who were still willing to ride A.T. with the intent of creating the ultimate team. He succeeded in this endeavour: at its peak, Sleeping Forest reigned over the A.T. world and was widely considered to be the greatest team of all time. Co-commanded by Kilik and Sora, its members held the Regalia of all the 8 major roads, a feat which has not been duplicated by any other team since.
However, Kilik gradually came to realise Sora`s true intentions, and became increasingly disillusioned with the violence and suffering occurring in the A.T. world. Matters come to a head when Kilik learns of the existence of the Second Generation of Gravity Children, and he leads a successful coup against Sora, remaking the team in his image.
At some point, its members R.E.A.D. data was collected and stored in a computer program as a virtual team named Inorganic Net. Since this team does not actually exist challengers must connect to a special server via a direct neural interface to access their territory. Inorganic Net is unique in that it has permanent seed status in the Gram Scale Tournament.</description>

He is originally part of Spitfire`s team, following the same road, until he decides to leave and join Behemoth. After Behemoth`s defeat he joins with Genesis, serving as Simca`s advisor, counselor, and occasional chauffeur. He eventually also serves Ikki and his team in the same manner. Although he is normally serious he is often used as a comic relief, with his "homosexuality" being a recurring gag. He is very close to Mimasaka Ryou and may also be attracted to her, as he is apparently furious at the Takeuchi brothers after she is "killed", which is contrary to his usually calm and rational demeanor.
He is eventually shown to be working under his father`s orders in an attempt to obtain the Sky Regalia, though he has his own goals. He helps Spitfire fight Sora and Nike though he is defeated and thought to be dead along with Spitfire. He is later shown to be alive and once again working for Genesis when he steals the Flame Regalia from Kazu, with no explanation to his apparent betrayal. However, the battle had left him scarred and with most of his body replaced with prosthetic, and Mimasaka on life support. After a confrontation with Sleeping Forest, a tracker on his body is inadvertently destroyed, and he reveals that Genesis had been using it to keep track of him. Free of listening ears, he asks Mikan to relay to Ikki that he is still loyal to him. However, because Genesis still has Mimasaka imprisoned, he cannot rejoin him.</description>

<description>Simca is the leader of the group Genesis. She is the twin sister of Kilik and a first generation gravity child. She was part of Tool Toul To until after Sleeping Forest is destroyed and eventually works under Nike. She takes great interest in Ikki, whom she believes is destined to one day become the legendary Sky King. She eventually has her hair cut short, abandons her usual care-free attitude, and focuses on strengthening Ikki, all out of her new found love for him. She is soon attacked by Sleeping Forest, however, and temporarily placed into a wheelchair. After Sora and Nike take over, she attempts to help Kogarasumaru enter the tournament, and she and Ikki promise to ride together afterward. Ine once exclaimed that Kururu (The New Pledge Queen) had tuning abilities equal to Simca; Simca was meant to be the succeeding Pledge Queen after Ine, but she left Tool Toul To after the breakdown of the old Sleeping Forest. Early in the series, Ikki fell in love with her, and she constantly appears naked to him or allows him to hug her while she`s naked as a reward. This is done much to Ringo`s chagrin.</description>

<description>Hako is an ordinary member of Tool Toul To who originally wants to become Ikki`s tuner to prove her ability. She steals the original Bagram Cores (part of the Wind Regalia) that were repaired by Kururu Sumeragi and replaces them with her own copy. She later attempts to seduce Ikki, thus becoming his tuner, but she is dismissed as being inferior to Kururu and Simca. She is eventually kidnapped and becomes Sora`s tuner. She regains her ties with her team afterwards and comes to terms with herself and her own feelings of inferiority.</description>

<description>Makigami Ine is the first Pledge Queen of Tool Toul To and of the original Sleeping Forest. She is also knowledgeable in medicine and runs her own hospital. Though none of the Gravity Children require tuners, Spitfire still has a close relationship with her before his death. She decides to break the rule of neutrality of Tool Toul To (along with many of its other members) and help Kogarasumaru develop. She passes down her title of Pledge Queen to Sumeragi Kururu.</description>
