<description>Ouran High School is a school for the extremely wealthy or talented. http://anidb.net/ch713 [Haruhi] just happens to be more talented than wealthy. Since she had a hair mishap the week before school started and could not afford the school uniform, she was mistaken for a boy.
Wandering into the Third Music Room looking for a quiet place to study, she encounters the school`s Host Club — a group of attractive young men who give their time and affections to females, for a fee. After she breaks an ¥8,000,000 vase belonging to the host club, the leader demands that she work off the money by becoming a host. And when they find out Haruhi is not actually a boy, humour ensues.</description>

<name>trap</name>
<description>A trap is a plot device where a male character is mistaken for a female, with the intention of sexually deceiving other characters and/or the viewer. This behavior does not need to be intentional by the male (it is often not intentional) or continually maintained by the male, but the occurrence is common enough to deserve this fetish-specific tag.
This is often achieved by portraying the male character as a female; primarily via their clothing and physical appearance, but also through his behaviour, and/or language. A male character misinterpreted by others as female, without action from the male (explicitly feminine dress or behaviour), is generally not considered a trap; instead they are likely just http://anidb.net/t2561 [androgynous].
The reverse case is known as a http://anidb.net/t1637 [reverse trap].

<name>moe</name>
<description>Moe is a Japanese slang loanword that refers to feelings of strong affection mainly towards characters in anime, manga, and video games. Moe, however, has also gained usage to refer to feelings of affection towards any subject. Moe can be related to lust; however, pure lust without other feelings is considered outside its scope. The word Moe originated in the late 1980s and early 1990s in Japan and is of uncertain origin, although there are several theories on how it came into use.
At the anime level, the http://anidb.net/t7146 [cute girls doing cute things (CGDCT)] tag may also apply.

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<tag id="2607" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2009-04-29">
<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<tag id="2608" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2012-12-04">
<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>medium awareness</name>
<description>Medium awareness is the situational and generally temporary awareness characters in works of fiction have and display of the very fact that they are characters in works of fiction. For example, they may comment about the background music, quip about the script or narration, complain about the roles given to them by the writer or their lack of screen time, see the subtitles that appear on screen, inform the audience about the arrival of the commercial break, and even use medium effects as tools. The most common form of medium awareness is known as breaking the fourth wall, in which characters speak directly to the audience, either to it as a whole or to specific members of it. The "fourth wall" is the imaginary "wall" at the front of the stage of a proscenium theatre through which the audience sees the play; it is a metaphor for the boundary between what happens inside the work, to the characters, and outside it, to the audience.</description>

<name>satire</name>
<description>In satire, vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, and society itself, into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be funny, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit as a weapon. (Wikipedia)</description>

<name>school clubs</name>
<description>Even though school clubs in Japan are not mandatory, there is some pressure from the social grid (e.g. fellow students, teachers) to participate in some kind of after-school activity, be it in sports or arts. Colleges also have clubs.
As a comedy element in anime, some students have joined too many clubs, and are thus constantly stressed out. There is also the element of social commentary, making it clear that you have to join a club, if you want to be part of the class. Since self-founded clubs need at least 3 members, the desperate search and advertising for new members can be cause for hilarity in anime.</description>

<name>reverse harem</name>
<description>Reverse harem, or sometimes also male harem, is the common name for the gender-reversed version of the usual http://anidb.net/t2859 [harem genre]. In a reverse harem, instead of the usual situation with several female characters focused on one male character, the viewer sees several male characters surrounding a single female character. Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. The most notable exception is that, due to the most relevant characteristics of the trope`s fan base, reverse harem authors tend to go for http://anidb.net/t1760 [bishounen] looks. Though they are also exceptions to the common harem genre, harems with homosexual relationships are not covered by reverse harem.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>mafia</name>
<description>A mafia is a type of organized crime syndicate whose primary activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions. Secondary activities may be practiced such as gambling, drug trafficking, loan sharking, and fraud. The term was originally applied to the Sicilian mafia, but has since expanded to encompass other organizations of similar methods and purpose, such as in "the Russian mafia" or "the Japanese mafia", and is applied informally by the press and public, but the criminal organizations themselves have their own terms; for example, the original Sicilian and Italian-American mafia call themselves "cosa nostra", while the Japanese mafia calls itself "yakuza".

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school.

<description>As part of a summer excursion or festival, an anime with school setting may also have a test of courage (or kimodameshi in Japanese), where the male and female students are paired up (by lottery) to retrieve a "charm" by passing though a "haunted house" or a scary forest at night.
The teachers usually disguise themselves as monsters or ghosts, scaring the students out of their socks.
This seems to be some sort of Japanese "coming of age" ritual, providing a certain level of excitement under controlled and safe circumstances.

A JDrama (Japanese drama), also called "terebi dorama" ("television drama") or "dorama" for short, is a Japanese live action television series.
Japan produces many drama series every year, from a huge variety of genres. Like anime, they generally air in three-month seasons or multiples thereof, with new shows airing every season. Some kinds of drama, especially the morning or afternoon ones, tend to be broadcast daily, while evening ones tend to be broadcast weekly, also like anime.
In exceedingly rare instances, a specific episode of a new original work anime can also be adapted.</description>

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<name>Suou Tamaki</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The president of the Host club and the Prince type. He is extremely passionate and kind, always ready to help people, and has an interest in many things. He is considered the most attractive of the hosts, very intelligent (2nd in his class behind Kyoya), and a gifted piano player. He is very sincere in what he says, and takes his role to please girls very seriously, which stems from his deep love of his mother. However, the other club members recognize him as an idiot most of the time because he is very dense about his own situations (though perceptive about others), very silly and melodramatic at times, and somewhat selfish and narcissistic. He also has an odd obsession for the "commoner`s lifestyle" and loves ramen and instant coffee (considered "commoner food"). He considers the Host Club to be a family and named himself father and Kyoya as the mother. His father is the superintendent of Ouran High School and his family is one of the wealthiest in Japan. His mother was forced to leave him so he would hopefully one day be recognized as the heir of the Suoh family by his grandmother, who does not like him. Tamaki is half-French and half-Japanese. He later discovers he possesses feelings for Haruhi that he is unable to decipher, still thinking them as family.</description>

<name>Fujioka Haruhi</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Haruhi Fujioka is the main character of the series. She is an intelligent but poor first-year student attending exclusive Ouran High School on a special scholarship that requires her rank first in her class. One day, while looking for a quiet place to study, she stumbles upon the Ouran Host Club and accidentally breaks an expensive vase belonging to the famed Host Club and must work off her debt as a host for them; to do this, she must disguise herself as a boy, which she finds easy to do because she does not feel that her gender dominates her personality. She soon realizes she enjoys acting as a host to other girls, which she takes to naturally, though she does not like taking time away from studying and finds the antics of the other hosts extremely irritating. Although habitually quiet and unflappable, she has a deep fear of thunderstorms. Haruhi lives with her okama (crossdressing) father and has become skilled in household chores due to her mother`s death when she was 6. Although her independent, straight-forward personality clashes with those of the other, more outgoing hosts, Haruhi becomes friends with them, especially the Hitachiin twins, who are in her class, a fact that is exceedingly troublesome to the Host Club King, Tamaki.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kyoya Ootori is a second-year student at Ouran High School and the cunning and sly vice-president of the Host Club. Kyoya is best friends with Tamaki, despite their completely different demeanors. Tamaki tends to call him "Mom", or "Mother", in reference to Tamaki calling himself "Daddy". Kyoya is secretive and intelligent, being able to calculate any benefits that would come out of the Host Club`s misadventures. Despite having quite antagonistic traits, the Host Club wouldn`t be as half as successful without Kyoya`s uptight resourcefulness. Although he doesn`t put an act for the women, he is considered the "cool type." He lives with his father, an affluent zaibatsu owner specializing in hospital management, two brothers that he has to surpass to become his father`s successor, and an older sister who deeply cares about him.</description>

<name>Hitachiin Hikaru</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Hikaru Hitachiin and Kaoru Hitachiin are first-year students at Ouran High School. They are depicted as mischievous, devious, and otherwise childish young men who often toy with fellow classmate and Host Club member, Haruhi. However, as they get to know her better, they start to care for her deeply, especially since they discovered that Haruhi can tell them apart even when they mess up their hair (the easiest way to tell them apart is the way they part their hair), something that no one has ever done before. When they were very young, a maid they were close to betrayed them, and when they asked her if she could play the "Which one is Hikaru?" game, she denied, telling them instead that no one would ever be able to tell them apart. They believed that no one could possibly win the game, and that no one cared about them enough to really try. Tamaki Suoh, however, in their last year of middle school, repeatedly followed them, tossing out random guesses as to who was Hikaru and who was Kaoru to get them to join the Host Club, citing his intuition each time. Finally they crumbled, and decided to just try out the Host Club, and thus took a step towards a wider world, also developing a deep bond with Tamaki. For this reason, they were originally cynical to the world before joining the Host Club, believing that anyone who is not the other twin cannot possibly compare to their bond. Additionally, because their parents were often away, they developed a deep dependence on each other through loneliness, but seem to open up to others recently, thus their relationship with Haruhi is a large part of their life. The Hitachiin twins show many instances of "brotherly love" (or twincest, as later mentioned in the manga) which gets girls to fall for them left and right. They are the little devil type to attract customers. However, they do have their differences. Kaoru is nicer, more mature, and considerate to the thoughts of others, while Hikaru is more childish and immature, although Hikaru is the older. Kaoru also chooses not to go after his feelings for Haruhi so that Hikaru can realize his own feelings first. The personality differences are only shown when they are separated, and there is a slight difference in the way they talk. They live with their mother, Yuzuha, a fashion designer, and their considerably meeker father, a computer software designer.</description>

<name>Haninozuka Mitsukuni</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Mitsukuni Haninozuka, usually called Honey, is a third-year at Ouran High School depicted as a very childish and cake-loving boy who is much older than his elementary school appearance would indicate. In the anime, there is a scene which shows the true strength and power Honey possesses and it is said that he has been told by Japan`s Defence Minister not to show his full power for fear of other countries thinking Japan held a weapon of mass destruction, causing the other countries to fire missiles at Japan (see episode 18 in the anime). Hunny is often around his cousin, Mori, who is very close to him. Honey lives with his father, the owner of a famous dojo and his little brother, Yasuchika, with whom he is often at odds. Hunny is very fond of eating sweets and his room is full of stuffed animals. He always carries around a plush bunny named Bun-Bun. He used to hide his true self (with much difficulty) by being a "real man" for some time, but after Tamaki convinced him that liking cute things wasn`t bad, he soon realised that there was absolutely no need for him to do that. Then, together with Mori, he joined the host club, attracting customers with his shotacon cuteness.</description>

<name>Morinozuka Takashi</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Takashi Morinozuka, usually called Mori, is a third-year at Ouran High School. Mori is depicted as tall, quiet and somewhat intimidating, but he is very protective of Hunny (who he calls by his first name, Mitsukuni, and vice versa). It was seen in the anime and manga where Hunny had a toothache. Mori blamed himself for not reminding Hunny to brush his teeth. He then restricted Hunny from eating candy until he had a filling for his cavity. Hunny ended up judo-throwing Mori to the floor in a fit of anger, but they made up soon afterwards. The Morinozuka family had protected and served the Haninozuka family for many generations. As the two families were joined by marriage two generations back, the families became related to each other, thus breaking the master-servant tradition. Nevertheless, Mori still faithfully protects Hunny and is always by his side, attending to his wishes and watching out for him; his protective personality extends to his classmates and the host club members, resulting in his gaining a certain level of respect. Although as a host, he is considered the "wild" type (changed to the strong, silent type in the dub, most likely to make it less confusing as it`s not explained why he`s the wild type), he normally doesn`t try to woo girls. The girls like how he cares for Hunny, and shyer customers are attracted to his tall physique and taciturn personality. Mori`s hobbies include kendo, of which he is the national champion.</description>

<description>Quon Kisaragi is a mysterious young girl who speaks the first words of the TV series and is shown meeting Ayato in episode 4. Her standard expression of surprise or agreement is "La-la" and most of her dialogue is cryptic and musically themed. She and Ayato do not connect romantically, but she displays a level of both physical and interpersonal comfort and intimacy with Ayato that is unmatched by any of the other characters, even Haruka. She is also one of the few people who never treats Ayato as a curiosity or an annoyance, and she seems to have an understanding of his situation and what his eventual role is, calling him "Orin".</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The Host Club`s (self-proclaimed) manager who tends to be very loud and outspoken. She had lived in France for a short time before she came to attend Ouran. Renge first came across the Host Club by maintaining the belief she was Kyouya`s fiancée despite never having met him in person. This is due to her love of visual novel-type video games to a point that she sometimes confuses them with real life. Her fascination with Kyouya originated from her obsession with one such dating game (Kyouya greatly resembled the lead character). Still, her experience with dating sims causes her to be more aware of character development and a thickening plot.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Fujioka Kotoko was Haruhi`s mother, who died when her daughter was still very young. Haruhi remarks in the first episode that it has been ten years since her mother died, which makes her about five years old at that time. She was an attorney at law; Haruhi takes after her in some ways and she remains Haruhi`s role-model. If the way in which Haruhi recalls her in her memories and dreams is accurate, she was a dedicated and loving mother who wished the best for her family. One can assume she was also open-minded to live with and love her husband, "Ranka". He states that Kotoko was both beautiful and intelligent and reveals that she was a closet fan of the St. Lobelia`s Zuka Club of her day. In later chapters, it is shown that she was popular at her law school and, in a recent omake, that she found Ryoji to be strange and annoying, but all the same liked him from the first moment they met.</description>

<description>Suou Yuzuru is the patriarch of the Suou family and chairman of Ouran Academy. He is the 48 year old father of Tamaki and his hobbies are golf, theater and teasing his son. Yuzuru shares some of his son`s characteristics. Despite knowing of his mother`s loathing of Tamaki, he can do little to help the situation. To date, his only act of rebellion against his mother`s wishes seems to be not breaking off his relationship with Tamaki`s mother, instead divorcing the woman his mother had chosen for him. In the anime, he appears to be cold to Tamaki, though this might be to show that he does not favor his son as a student, as a scene in the anime shows photographs of Tamaki at different stages of life on his office desk. It also seems Tamaki gained his charms from his father. Tamaki is very serious in Yuzuru`s presence, but the manga is a little different, showing Yuzuru as eager to tease his son at every opportunity, sending him red herrings in the middle of an investigation and telling tall tales.</description>

<description>Ootori Takao, Kyouya`s father, is the patriarch of the Ootori family. Takao is portrayed as a cold, calculating father. Kyouya tries hard to please him to become heir of the family, despite the fact that his father apparently shows no understanding for his children and has planned out the lives of his sons as his successors already.
In the manga, he acknowledges Kyouya as a possible successor despite being the third son. In the anime, he states he has already decided Kyouya would inherit Ootori Medical from him (in the manga, he states it is a possibility), only to have his third son buy it and return it to his control without ever revealing his identity. He wants Kyouya to marry Haruhi in the anime.

<description>Ootori Fuyumi is Kyouya`s older sister. In the anime, she appears during Kyouya`s flashbacks about his first meeting with Tamaki. She clearly cares for her younger brother and tries to help him in life. She is somewhat lacking in the areas of housework and organization as any time she tries to help Kyouya packing clothes they ends up all over the place literally, but appears to be a kind-hearted person. The manga reveals that she is married, but returned home for a short visit. Her husband`s surname is Shido (矢道). She and Tamaki are pursuing a tour of commoners` food together.</description>

She tracks down Tamaki in Japan and convinces him to leave the Host Club, offering him a chance to see his mother if he complies with her wishes. She secures noninterference from the Ootori group by arranging for the Grand Tonnerre Group to buy Ootori Medical so as to control Kyoya`s father.</description>

<description>http://anidb.net/ch717 [Mitsukuni "Honey" Haninozuka]`s younger brother, whom Honey calls "Chika". He often feels overshadowed by his older brother and has grown a lasting resentment towards him for enjoying things that are cute and dropping out as the Karate Club`s President. He is also very astonished by the amount of cake he eats in one night and how quickly he does so. His greatest ambition is to one day finally defeat his brother in combat, but in the end Honey easily defeats him, choosing the things he loves most over his brother`s feelings, much to Mori`s surprise.
Yasuchika`s best friend is Satoshi Morinozuka, the younger brother of Mori. Both seem to be polar opposites of their older brothers, however, it is shown that underneath Chika`s attitude, he is much like Honey, crying easily and collecting cute stuffed toy chicks and chick photo books. He goes to seventh grade while his older brother is at Ouran Academy.</description>

He has romantic feelings for Class 1-A`s Vice-President Momoka, whom he has known for years, but he is initially too shy to say anything. Hikaru and Kaoru comment that he is the kind of person with pure feelings who they cannot tease, possibly because he is more emotionally vulnerable than Tamaki. In the manga, he unwittingly caused Haruhi trouble with her scholarship when he ranked as the top student of his grade.</description>
