<description>The Fury of Zoroark Has Been Unleashed!
The Pokémon Baccer World Cup.
It is the most anticipated event of the year, and as hundreds flock to Crown City to watch the exciting competition unfold, Ash, Pikachu, and his friends encounter a mysterious new Pokémon they have never seen before.
But when the three Legendary Pokémon Raikou, Entei, and Suicune suddenly arrive and begin rampaging through the streets, it`s up to Ash and his companions, along with their new Pokémon friend Zorua, to uncover the secret behind the immense and powerful forces at work.
What strange and dangerous powers are afoot in Crown City? Why did Celebi suddenly return after vanishing for twenty years? And why is the mighty Zoroark unleashing its fury upon the town? The quest for these answers leads down an uncertain path filled with peril—can Ash and his companions find enough courage, strength, and friendship to unearth the mystery in time to save Crown City?

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>In our terms, a proxy battle is a battle where humans use creatures/robots to do the fighting for them, either by commanding those creatures/robots or by simply evolving them/changing them into battle mode. Often the training aspect is also involved, or in some cases the proxies are nothing more than holographic representatives of some other variation of competition (like for example a card game). While many popular shounen anime fit under this category, it`s not limited to shounen anime.</description>

<description>Venusaur known as the Seed Pokémon, is the final stage in Bulbasaur evolution. The seed finally bloomed into a huge flower, vaguely resembling a Rafflesia. The flower constantly draws in sunlight for nutrition, characterized by vivid colors and a soothing aroma, and power, which is much more substantial in the summer. They are always on the move to absorb more sunlight, though they usually remain quiet and still while absorbing it. After it rains, the aroma is much stronger, which attracts other Pokémon. Female Venusaur have a seed coming out of the flower, possibly representing a pregnancy. Being the final form of Grass starter, Venusaur can learn Hyper Beam, Giga Impact and Frenzy Plant.</description>

<description>Pidgeot, known as the Bird Pokémon, is a bird-like Pokémon, whose original name in the English beta version of Pokémon Red and Blue was "Pidgeott", is the fully grown and developed form of the Pidgey species evolution line. In the main Pokémon game series, a Pidgeot is only acquired when a Pidgeotto grows past experience level 36 and is evolved into a Pidgeot. Pidgeot are large, powerful birds admired for their glossy plumage and their battling ability. With their powerful chest muscles at work, Pidgeot can flap their wings fast enough to whip up gusts of winds to rival tornadoes. Pidgeot are very aerodynamic, capable of soaring to an altitude of 3300 feet and reaching speeds of up to Mach 2. Like Pidgeotto, Pidgeot feed on Magikarp by swooping from the sky and snatching them out of the water with their talons. Pidgeot appear very similar to Pidgeotto, so much so that one has been easily mistaken for the other, even by official sources.
In the Pokémon anime, Ash`s Pidgeotto evolves into a Pidgeot near the end of the Kanto saga, and remained in Pallet Town to watch over a flock of Pidgey and Pidgeotto while Ash went off to the Orange Islands.</description>

<description>Bellsprout is a carnivorous, flower-like Pokémon, hunting small insects with blinding agility despite its skinny body. It is said to ensnare its prey in its vines and devour it, and can also spit a highly corrosive fluid that can melt even iron. Bellsprout`s preferred habitat is warm and humid climates, since it can absorb more moisture from the ground by planting its root-like feet. In battle, Bellsprout can take advantage of its flexibility to bend and sway its way out of the range of its opponent`s attacks, no matter how powerful they may be.
In the video games, Bellsprout is commonly found among grassy routes, and is used by many Trainers who favor the Grass-type. In Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, the Sprout Tower in Violet City is dedicated to Bellsprout.
Bellsprout has appeared numerous times in the anime series, most notably in "The Fourth Round Rumble," where Ash battled one during the Indigo League. He eventually defeated it with Muk.</description>

<description>"Tentacruel" is probably a portmanteau of "tentacle", the reason for which is obvious, and the adjective "cruel", referring to its personality. The name may have something to do with the deep-sea jellyfish called Tentaculata. Its name was originally going to be Man-O-War, which refers to the Portuguese man o` war. The Japanese name, "Dokukurage," is a portmanteau, of 毒 doku (poison) and 水母 kurage (jellyfish). It resembles its pre-evolution Tentacool to a small degree - the "head" of Tentacool has now been made into a hat-like shape on top of a black orb containing its eyes and two very large hooks which resembles a long nose. Also, unlike Tentacool, it has up to 80 tentacles, most of which are hidden, leaving up to 14 exposed.</description>

<description>Rapidash is a Fire-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Ponyta starting at level 40.
In Galar, Rapidash has a Psychic/Fairy-type regional form. It evolves from Galarian Ponyta starting at level 40.
Rapidash is an equine Pokémon with cream-colored fur and a pointed horn on its forehead. It has small, red eyes and triangular ears with reddish interiors. Yellow and reddish-orange flames stream from the back of its head to form a long, flowing mane. A short version of the mane trails down its back to its equally fiery tail. Flames are also present on its fetlocks. It has slender legs, each with a single black hoof.
Rapidash is a very agile Pokémon. It runs at about 150 mph (240 km/h), chasing everything that moves in hopes of racing it. With incredible acceleration, it reaches its top speed in only ten steps. At full gallop, its hooves barely touch the ground. The faster Rapidash goes, the longer the swaying flames of its mane will become. At an all-out gallop, its blazing mane sparkles, a feature which is said to enhance its beautiful appearance. Rapidash lives in grasslands, but it can also be seen on mountains in Pokémon Snap.</description>

<description>Onix is a subterranean creature that bores its way through the ground at a rate of 50 mph (80 km/h) in search of food. The tunnels it leaves behind as it burrows through the earth are used as pre-dug homes by other subterranean Pokémon such as Diglett and Geodude. Within Onyx`s member is a structure nigh identical to a magnet, which allows it to determine its heading, its depth underground, and other such information useful for a subterranean Pokémon to know. It acts quite like a compass. As Onix ages, it burrows deeper underground, and its rocky member becomes progressively harder, rounder, and smoother. Around the age of 100, the pressures exerted on its stone member become so high that it is compressed into a much harder, diamond-like composition, although it is closer to metal in nature.
In the anime, an Onix is owned by Brock as part of the many Pokemon owned by the training gym that Brock`s family runs. Brock had initially received the Onix from his father, who is a specialist in rock-type Pokemon. When Brock feels the need to travel with Ash Ketchum yet again, he entrusts the care of the Onix to one of his many younger brothers. This takes place in Pokémon Chronicles. It eventually evolves into a Steelix.</description>

<description>Exeggutor`s name is believed to be derived from the name of its previous evolutionary stage (Exeggcute), whose name is derived from egg and the word execute so Exeggutor`s name is a combination of egg and executor. The Japanese name is derived from the words ココナッツ kokonattsu (coconuts) and 椰子 yashi (palm tree). A large Coconut Tree like Pokémon with three independent thinking heads. The heads are considered fruit or nuts and each has a different expression on its face similar to Exeggcute. When an Exeggcute evolves into Exeggutor, any and all cracks and breaks are mended as they turn yellow and combine to form the new Exeggutor. Living in a good environment will allow it to grow lots of heads, and it is said that they occasionally fall off to form new Exeggcute.</description>

<description>Since Electabuzz is electric, he feeds on electrical currents. Its methods of securing its food vary: during thunderstorms, an Electabuzz climbs to the highest place possible, in hopes that it will be struck by lightning. As a result, many towns in the Pokémon world employ an Electabuzz in lieu of a lightning rod. Electabuzz also lurk around power plants, feeding off the electricity generated there. This behavior is dangerous to the public, as occasionally blackouts are caused by an Electabuzz overindulging itself at a power plant, or worse, walking down to a city and drawing electricity from there.
Due to its unique diet, Electabuzz`s body is constantly discharging stored electricity, to the point that it glows whitish blue in darkness and static electricity effects manifest. An Electabuzz can control the electric current coursing in its body to communicate with other Electric-type Pokémon, especially with another Electabuzz. It originally is lone in its evolutionary line, but it gains a previous form, Elekid, in Pokémon Gold and Silver, and an evolution, Electivire, in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.
Like Scyther, as seen in the anime, Electabuzz is most likely provoked by the color red.</description>

<description>Magikarp is a commonly found Pokémon that can survive in rivers, lakes,and oceans. Despite its adaptability, the Pokédex states that the Magikarp species has grown weaker over time, and it is one of the least viable for battling in the series. It eventually evolves into another, far more powerful Pokémon, Gyarados.
Magikarp is commonly thought of as the weakest Pokémon. They are only able to learn three moves: Splash (does absolutely nothing), Tackle (a weak attack), and Flail (which does more damage as Magikarp is more damaged.)
In the anime, Magikarp has appeared several times, most notably as the subject of a running gag in which a salesman attempts to trick Team Rocket into buying Magikarp in various guises. (This man also appears in Pokémon Red, Blue, Yellow, FireRed, and LeafGreen.) Team Rocket later adopted a Magikarp-shaped submarine.
Magikarp also appear many times in the video games. They can be found in almost any pond, river, lake, or sea. Many trainers have them, along with other weak Water Pokémon like Goldeen or Horsea. In Pokémon Pearl, one trainer named "Ander," found outside Lake Valor, possesses a Magikarp whose move "Quake" replaces the normal Magikarp`s equally useless "Splash".</description>

<gender>dimorphic</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Gyarados is the evolved form of Magikarp. It is a dramatically large change from Magikarp, going from a small fish to a long draconic, serpentine body. Gyarados tend to be very aggressive, and are powerful enough to destroy entire cities. They have a reputation for appearing where there is conflict, and shrivelling everything up with the Hyper Beam attack. Rampages like this have been known to last upwards of an entire month, and will not end until everything around them has been destroyed. Because they have been known to sink ships as well through the seastorms their rage causes, they are considered legendary among sailors, especially the red/ golden variety. Its big change in behavior is said to be attributed to a structural change occurring in its brain while evolving from Magikarp.
In the beta version of Pokémon Red and Green, Gyarados had the name of Skullkraken.
Shiny Gyarados is a particularly rare variety of Gyarados. While Gyarados are normally blue in color, there are some rare red/ gold scaled Gyarados. Though no more powerful than their more common blue counterparts, red Gyarados are valued for their rarity and individuality. This is caused in Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal and the anime by a radio frequency transmitted by Team Rocket to force the Magikarp to evolve. The red coloration comes from the Magikarp evolving prematurely, and not undergoing the conversion from red to blue scale pigment. Thus, they retain the same color they had as a Magikarp. Red Gyarados are more commonly called Shiny Gyarados, or even Golden Gyarados due to the contrasting coloration.
In Generation II Pokémon games, a red Gyarados at the Lake of Rage is a main part of the plot. After its defeat or capture, a Red Scale is obtained, which can be given to Mr. Pokémon, or Marcus Spanier, in exchange for an Exp. Share. The red Gyarados is the only Pokémon in the Generation II games that will be shiny without fail.
In the anime, one is owned by Misty. At first, she fearfully dislikes Gyarados due to a traumatic experience, but manages to get over the fear, take over the Cerulean City Gym, and add one to her team. The red Gyarados in the anime is caught by Lance, the dragon trainer, to rescue it from Team Rocket. Team Rocket also uses a Gyarados-shaped submarine in early episodes, but trades it for a Magikarp-shaped submarine in later episodes.
Gyarados was noticeably larger in the Indigo Series, but has since become a lot smaller. Gyarados` most powerful attack is said to be Dragon Rage (however, this is not true in the games, given that Dragon Rage only ever does 40 damage), where many other Gyarados appear around the main Gyarados, then they start spinning around at such a speed they became one huge tornado, as seen in Episode #18: Island of The Giant Pokémon.</description>

<description>Lapras is a dual-type Water/Ice Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, it has a Gigantamax form.
Lapras is a large sea Pokémon that resembles a plesiosaur. It has a blue hide with darker blue spots and a cream-colored underside. It has large brown eyes, a short horn on its forehead, and tightly curled ears. It has a long neck and four flippers. The foremost flippers are larger than the hind. On its back is a heavy, gray shell covered in blunt knobs.
Lapras is a gentle, helpful Pokémon that enjoys ferrying people across bodies of water. In the past, its docility made it an easy target for hunters, and it was driven to near-extinction. Recent protection efforts have seen Lapras become overabundant instead, which is now affecting the fish Pokémon numbers in some areas. An intelligent Pokémon, it is able to understand human speech. Lapras have been known to travel in large pods across the seas, spanning both polar and tropical areas. To keep in touch with other of its kind, it sings enchanting melodies. In the anime it was shown that Lapras is able to develop psychic abilities such as telepathy.
As Gigantamax Lapras, it becomes larger in size and more armored. Its shell resembles a cruise ship with four gray and red stripes surrounding it, and it has four spikes on top of its shell with one steel spike resembling a funnel, which has three red clouds surrounding it. The sclera in Lapras` eyes change colors to white, yellow, and blue. A light blue ring of fine thin lines resembling a musical sheet created from ice particles circles around its shell.
5,000 people can ride on the shell of Gigantamax Lapras for a very comfortable ride without any issues. Lapras can use it giant ring to break any icebergs that may prevent it from swimming.
Gigantamax Lapras is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Resonance.</description>

<description>Aerodactyl is an ancient Pokémon from the prehistoric age that is regenerated from genetic material extracted from amber in the video games. It is imagined to have been the king of the skies in ancient times, with a body structure similar to a pterodactyl and other features, such as the head and tail, having more in common with dragons. It captures its prey with its talons and brings it to its nest. However, if the prey resists, it may use its razor-sharp teeth to immobilize it. When attacking its enemies or opponents, it goes for the throat with its saw like fangs. Aerodactyl is heavy and rough-skinned, leading to the development of strong wings.</description>

<description>Articuno is one of the three Legendary Birds along with Zapdos and Moltres. It is a large bird with blue plumage, a bluish-white-feathered chest, a three feathered crest adorning its nose, and a long, sparkling tail. It can create and manipulate ice freely. Its translucent wings are imbued with the essence of frigidity, and the flapping of its wings chills the air, causing the conversion of water particles in the air into snow or ice, causing snow to fall when it flies overhead. In legend, Articuno resides within the confines of icy mountains, because those who have seen its were often doomed explorers scaling such mountains, and therefore it is believed Articuno makes it a point to appear before them and save them.
It is interesting to note that the last letters of its name, "uno" ("one" in Spanish), suggest it is the first of the three legendary bird Pokémon. This is reinforced by the fact that the last letters of the names of its fellow legendary birds suggest that they are the second and third. They are Zapdos ("dos", which is "two" in Spanish) and Moltres ("tres", which is "three" in Spanish).
Articuno`s video game appearances occur in the very confusing mazes of the icy Seafoam Islands, on Route 20, between Fuschia City and Cinnabar Island. It is a unique Pokémon that usually appears alongside Zapdos and Moltres. Since only one of each exists in the games, players usually try to catch the Birds.
Articuno also makes appearances in the anime and manga, also as a unique Pokémon and a general species. They participate in various events and battles. Articuno was initially believed to be the large golden bird Ash saw in the very first episode, but it turned out to actually be Ho-Oh, though the earlier reference was kept in the Red, Blue, Yellow game versions when one looked into a telescope and saw it. Its largest role is in Pokémon: The Movie 2000. Lawrence III creates a battle between the three birds, and Ash Ketchum had to team up with Lugia to stop them. In the beginning of the Battle Frontier challenge in the anime, Noland, the battle factory frontier brain had befriended one. After reuniting with their photographer friend Todd, Ash and its friends hear a rumor that Articuno lives on a certain mountain. After several encounters with Team Rocket, Ash and Todd are saved by Articuno from a snowstorm, and Todd manages to snap a picture of it. Ash`s Charizard did battle with it and Articuno lost by a narrow margin.
In Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, Articuno is the third legendary boss as well as the third legendary bird you battle. He is also the hardest to convince of the three legendary birds that the main hero Pokémon is not responsible for the havocs in the Pokémon World. Absol prevents Articuno from ending the hero and partner by ensuring that Articuno knows the truth.</description>

<description>Zapdos is one of the three Legendary Birds along with Articuno and Moltres. It may be based on the thunderbird. It is a bird with a yellow, angular body and wings. Also behind its main yellow wings is a second pair of thinner, jet-black wings. Its beak is long and extremely sharp. Zapdos, a creature that can freely manipulate electricity, is thought to live in thunderclouds, where it apparently only gains power when struck by lightning. It is seen emerging from clouds while dropping enormous lightning bolts, and even if it does not launch electricity its wings make peculiar crackling and snapping sounds as it flies.
It is interesting to note that the last letters of its name, "dos" ("two" in Spanish), suggest it is the second of the three legendary bird Pokémon. This is reinforced by the fact that the last letters of the names of its fellow legendary birds suggest that they are the first and third. They are Articuno ("uno", which is "one" in Spanish) and Moltres ("tres", which is "three" in Spanish).
Zapdos is found in a Power Plant off the coast of the Rock Tunnel near Cerulean City in Pokémon Red and Blue, and related games. It also plays small roles in the anime and manga. Zapdos is featured in Pokémon The Movie 2000 together with the other two Legendary birds, Articuno and Moltres. It appears that Zapdos communicates through electricity as it shocks Pikachu to communicate. Zapdos also appeared in the 9th Pokémon Movie.</description>

<description>Moltres is one of the three Legendary Birds, along with Articuno and Zapdos. It is a large bird that is literally ablaze with fire, resembling something related to a phoenix. It has an orange body, a small pointed beak, and where its plumage should be are flames of a searing intensity. It can freely create and manipulate fire, and it constantly looses flaming embers from its wings. When its body is injured for any reason, it will head towards a volcano and dip its body in the molten magma to heal its wounds. Moltres is an elusive creature, seen about as rarely as the other two members of the Legendary Bird triad. When Moltres thinks it is in the least bit possible danger, it will summon a flash of fire and seemingly disappear, flying out of sight very fast.
The first video game appearance of Moltres was in Pokémon Red and Blue versions. In these Versions, Moltres was in a blocked off area of Victory Road, only accessible from the end of the cave. However, Moltres was moved from its lair in FireRed and LeafGreen, to Mount Ember, an active volcano, on 1 Island, the first of the new Sevii Islands.
The first official appearance of Moltres in the anime was in the episode that marks the beginning of the Pokémon League, where it lights the torch which is equivalent to the real-life Olympic Torch. It also plays a role in "Pokémon The Movie 2000: The Power of One", along with the other two Legendary Birds (Zapdos and Articuno). It was one of the two birds that the villainous collector, often referred to as both Gelardan and Lawrence III, captured to allow him access to Lugia`s power, but the upset of the balance that occurred as a result nearly caused a worldwide weather catastrophe as Moltres was driven to wage war with its two rivals. They were quelled once Ash and Lugia fulfilled the prophecy related to the legendary birds. In a later episode of Pokémon Chronicles, Ash`s rival Richie encountered a trainer named Silver who wanted to capture Moltres, battling him with its Salamence. Silver is interrupted by Team Rocket members Butch and Cassidy who attempt to kidnap Moltres, rather than catching him fairly. Richie and Silver team up to defeat Butch and Cassidy and rescue Moltres, although the firebird was badly weakened by the Rockets` attack. Silver let Moltres go, wanting to catch him in a fair fight when it was at full strength, although it promised it`d try again.
According to one of the trainers in Blaine`s gym on Cinnabar Island, Blaine decided to become a trainer of Fire-type Pokémon after having been rescued by a fiery bird when lost in the mountains.</description>

Meganium`s antennae are smaller in females than in males.
The pheremones within its flower are its defense against those who would attack it for its size; they give off a fragrance that can instill feelings of peace and calm in all around it, thus suppressing their need to attack Meganium for food. This fragrance is effective enough to affect even a Pokémon like Primeape, which is noted for its unmatched temper. Meganium also has magically natural powers in its breath, which somehow is able to restore life to dead plants and grass.</description>

When Ledyba become part of a swarm, they become much more active and can cluster next to each other for warmth in cold weather. A Ledyba communicates with others through an aromatic fluid excreted from the points where its legs meet its thorax. By subtly changing the fluid`s scent, the Ledyba can convey a number of different feelings. The fluid can also help to determine a Ledyba`s location as well as its current feelings.
Ledyba is based on a ladybug.</description>

These spots have also been observed glowing red during twilight hours as Ledian are attached to trees, making these trees seem like Christmas trees. Male Ledian are shown having longer antennae than females.
Ledian is a nocturnal insect, active mainly during the night and sleeping in curled-up leaves during the day. Countless Ledian live in outdoor areas located a good distance away from the polluted atmospheres of cities, for the star-lit skies are always clearer in these clean lands than in the light pollution of urban areas. Ledian have an affinity to stars for good reason; They take their energy from the light of the stars in order to live healthily. When many stars are visible, the Ledian will sprinkle a mysterious, glowing powder whilst fluttering about.</description>

<description>Bellossom is a diurnal plant Pokémon. It evolves from Gloom if exposed to a Sun Stone. Bellossom`s petals can rotate, and they usually do when it is absorbing sunlight. The color of their leaves vary from a sickly brown and gray to a fluorescent yellow and red, depending on how much sunlight it has absorbed in the past few hours. When its petals are moving, either due to rotating or dancing, they rub together to make relaxing, bell-like sounds. The petals on its head also create a sweet scent.
It is also noted that a Bellossom will be even more beautiful if it was an especially rancid Gloom. The worse it smells as a Gloom, the prettier its petals will be as a Bellossom. Although naturally a peaceful and friendly Pokémon, it can be very territorial and violent fights can break out if there is an intruder or a challenger. Despite this, it is very social in areas outside of its self-determined territory, and the most common time to find a group of Bellossom together is when they all meet in one location to dance. It is said that these dances summon the sun.
Its Japanese name, "Kireihana", translates to "Beautiful" (kirei) and "Flower" (hana).</description>

<description>Marill is an aquatic mouse Pokémon. Marill`s tail floats like a buoy because it is filled with oil, which is less dense than water. When fishing at a fast-running stream, Marill wraps its tail around a tree. Since the tail is stretchy and flexible, it allows the Pokémon to get food and still stay safely anchored. Otherwise, when in a lake, it uses the buoy-qualities of its tail to keep itself suspended as the rest of its body dives underwater to feed on aquatic plants. Its fur is impermeable, which keeps it dry, and that allows it to swim through water at high speed without being slowed by the water`s resistance.
In the Pokémon Anime, Tracey, the Pokémon Observer from the Orange Islands, has a Marill which he uses on multiple occasions.</description>

<description>Azumarill is the evolved form of Marill. Azumarill resembles a blue, bipedal rabbit with a large, ellipsoid body, long blue ears with red insides, and a blue ball on the end of its thin, elastic black tail. The white bubble-like pattern on its lower stomach helps it to camouflage itself from potential predators when it is in the water.
Azumarill`s long ears act as sensors to identify sounds even in fast running rivers. Otherwise, when alone, Azumarill plays in water as a natural pastime, though it must roll up its elongated ears to prevent the sensitive sensory materials inside them from getting wet. The ball at the end of its tail can act as a sensor and guide it while under water. It can make thick, liquid balloons out of thin air with the saliva-water stored in its body. If it spots a drowning Pokémon in any body of water, it fashions such air balloons and jumps in to give the troubled Pokémon air balloons to help it breathe.
In the Pokémon anime, Paul owned an Azumarill which he used in a gym battle against Roark. Although it knew powerful Water attacks like Hydro Pump, it lost to Roark`s Geodude, which prompted Paul to give it to a Pokémon trainer passing by, being disappointed by its strength.</description>

<description>Hoppip are small, spherical creatures, with long leaves protruding from their head. They have small, gripping feet and ears disproportionate to their body, used to listen for winds. Hoppip have extremely petite and almost weightless bodies, and are susceptible to strong winds due to this. When a Hoppip feels a gale approaching, it will lock the leaves on its head with the leaves of other Hoppip, in an attempt to avoid being blown away. If a Hoppip is by itself when in heavy winds, it may grip the ground with its feet to prevent this. Despite the dangers Hoppip face in strong winds, they enjoy gentle breezes and can float in the calmest of winds, which can carry them across vast distances.</description>

The leaves have turned into a large yellow flower. The flower on its head blossoms at 64 degrees Fahrenheit. As the temperature increases, the flower gradually opens further. This allows Skiploom to be used as a thermometer. It is capable of floating in the air, a skill it uses to get closer to the sun in order to better absorb the sunlight. When the sunlight is strong, its ability, Chlorophyll, increases its speed. When it rains, the flower instantly closes and Skiploom hides under a tree to avoid getting wet.</description>

<description>Sunflora is the evolved form of Sunkern. Sunflora is a diurnal sunflower Pokémon; unlike its unevolved form Sunkern, it is wholly inactive at night. However, it is very active and playful during the day when the sun is bright. Like Bellossom, it evolves using a Sun Stone. Sunflora prefer hot climates; their foliage becomes more colorful and elaborate as the temperature rises. Sunflora unfurl their petals and absorb sunlight for energy. It is possible for a Sunflora to absorb too much sunlight, though. When this happens, its head and petals become engorged and very heavy, which is dangerous for a Sunflora, since it can wilt and possibly get sick. At night, the petals are furled, covering Sunflora`s face.
A Sunflora is constantly soaking up sunlight and moving around in a blissful fashion. In preparation for winter, Sunflora will migrate to warmer and sunnier areas, so as not to lose the vital source of their energy. Sunflora like to live in flower patches. They do their best to stay hidden among the other flowers, but usually they are very noticeable.</description>

<description>Quagsire has an appearance and habitat similar to that of a giant salamander. Quagsire live a carefree life in muddy ponds and rivers. It acts oblivious to its environment, accidentally bumping its head on the hulls of boats and bottoms of whatever body of water it swims in as it swims, but seeming not to care. Quagsire always bear an absent-looking facial expression. This is likely due to Quagsire`s easy-going nature. It hunts by staying still in the water with its mouth open, waiting for small prey to swim into its mouth. It doesn`t move, and therefore, doesn`t get hungry. It`s not uncommon that a fishermen`s hook will get caught in the gaping mouth of a feeding Quagsire. Trying to eat what it has caught, the Quagsire would try to swallow, and end up pulling the fishermen off his boat and into the water. Male Quagsire have larger fins on their backs. They wait at the bottom of lakes waiting for prey to wander into its mouth. It also loves eating cherries.</description>

<description>Slowking is one of the two different species Slowpoke can evolve into, Slowbro being the other. Slowking`s appearance is essentially identical to that of Slowpoke, with a few additions: it stands upright, it sports a red-and-white ruff around its neck and it has a bone-like structure on top of its head that is a cross between a helmet and a crown. This is actually a different form of Shellder, similar to the one biting Slowbro`s tail. When Slowking is viewed from behind, the eyes of the Shellder can be seen. The Shellder biting Slowking`s head injects toxins inside its brain every time Slowking yawns. The poisons interact with Slowking`s neural tissue to unlock mental faculties hitherto untapped, making Slowking considerably smarter and more alert than the sluggish Slowpoke or Slowbro. This makes it stand out among the aforementioned species, which recognize it as a leader of sorts.
The anime adds a ritualistic test to select the leader of the Slowpoke and Slowbro. A group of Slowpoke gather in a Shellder-infested lake, at the middle of which laid a King`s Rock. The Slowpoke that manages to dodge the Shellder and avoid evolving into Slowbro make it to the King`s Rock and places it on its head, whereupon a Shellder clamps on the rock, triggering Slowpoke`s evolution into Slowking.
Some Slowking have shown themselves capable of learning human speech, as seen in the movie Pokémon 2000 in which one helps Ash restore order to the world by getting three spheres protected by Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres.</description>

Ursaring can hibernate through an entire winter without any food. Ursaring`s sense of smell is among the most developed of all Pokémon; it can detect subtle differences in scents. For this reason, Ursaring is sometimes used by police in the Pokémon universe, both as a strong enforcer, and as an explosive-sniffing Pokémon. If criminals are hiding in trees, it can use its claws to cut down the tree.
Its Japanese name, "Ringuma", originates from "ring" (ringu) and "bear" (kuma). In the anime, Ursaring is caught by Paul, after it is angered by Turtwig.</description>

In return, the Mantine helps defend the Remoraid from enemies. When not scavenging for food, Remoraid will strike down its own prey with precise accuracy using fast streams of airborne water, which Remoraid shoots from its mouth using abdominal muscles. Remoraid can move faster through the water by blasting water from its mouth in the opposite direction of where it intends to move.</description>

Its large and well-developed wings enable it to briefly leap over the sea`s surface if it builds up enough speed, in a manner similar to some real aquatic species. Mantine is a filter feeder, like whales; its diet consists of most things that happen to enter its mouth while swimming.</description>

<description>Skarmory is an avian Pokémon with a body of metal armor. Its bones are hollow, allowing it to fly over 180 miles per hour in the sky. Skarmory raises its offspring in bramble bushes, the thorny environment causing the offspring`s bodies to become more resistant. Skarmory`s wings become battered from repeated battles, so it grows the feathers back to the original state once a year. Feathers from Skarmory have been used by people of the past as knives and swords. It is based on the Stymphalian birds of Greek mythology.</description>

<description>Elekid is the baby form of Electabuzz, introduced in Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal. Elekid stores electricity in its body by constantly rotating its arms, causing the space between its horns to flicker with a bluish-white electrical charge. It easily tires out, so it can only charge a little bit at a time if it accidentally touches metal and discharges its electricity. It is always happy when there is thunder rumbling, even in the most vicious of storms.</description>

<description>Raikou is one of the three "Legendary Beasts" that are featured in Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal. According to legend, the Legendary Beasts were reincarnated by Ho-Oh from the spirits of three Pokémon which died in the fire that gave Burnt Tower its name. They are awakened in this tower in their first appearance. Another myth maintains that Raikou descended to earth together with a lightning bolt. Each Beast personifies a force of nature - Raikou, in particular, embodies the speed of lightning.
Like many Electric-type Pokémon, Raikou stores tremendous energy inside its body. This grants it extraordinary vitality, allowing it to run continuously across the land while shooting off electricity from the rain cloud that is on its back. Raikou`s roar is aptly described as "thunderous": it is loud enough to create shock waves and shake the ground as if actual thunder had struck.
Raikou is featured in a special anime episode called Raikou - The Legend of Thunder that forms the first three episodes of Pokémon Chronicles. In the special, two Team Rocket agents named Attila and Hun scheme to capture Raikou with a device that reflects and deflects energy blasts. Three New Bark Town trainers risk their own lives to try and save Raikou. It is thought by the trainers that Raikou attempts to guard other electric Pokémon from danger whenever possible.</description>

According to legend, the Legendary Beasts were reincarnated by Ho-Oh from the spirits of three Pokémon which died in the fire that gave Burnt Tower its name. They are awakened in this tower in their first video game appearance. Other myths maintains that it is born during the eruption of a volcano, and that a new one is born along with each volcano.
Entei is an embodiment of magma, being able to launch powerfully searing, fire that is hotter than magma from its mouth. This fire consumes everything that it touches. When it roars, volcanos around it are apparently triggered to erupt. Due to being unable to fully control its own power, it constantly sprints around the world.
Entei is the main Pokémon in the movie Pokémon the Movie 3: Spell of the Unown, in which the Unown create it from Molly`s imagination.</description>

According to legend, the Legendary Beasts were reincarnated by Ho-Oh from the spirits of three Pokémon which died in the fire that gave Burnt Tower its name. They are awakened in this tower in their first video game appearance. It is the incarnation of northern winds, which always blow as it passes throughout the world. It also embodies the compassion of a spring, so as it travels, it seeks out pure reservoirs of water, and using its power, it instantly purifies dirty, muddy, or otherwise polluted water into the clearest of liquids by simply stepping into it.
In Pokémon Crystal Suicune is the star Pokémon, in a similar way that Pokémon Gold showcased Ho-oh or Pokémon Silver showcased Lugia. Eusine, a mysterious trainer, appears throughout the course of the game. He is set on meeting and catching Suicune, and will battle the player for that honor. Eventually, Suicune can be caught by heading to the Tin Tower after obtaining the Clear Bell. Three old men will challenge the player to a battle and if they are defeated, they will allow access to a floor where Suicune waits to battle.
Suicune makes various appearances in the anime, mainly appearing before Ash and his friends. It is featured in various episodes, and it plays a role in the movie, Pokémon 4Ever.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Lugia is a legendary Pokémon that first appears in Pokémon Gold and Silver, appearing on the boxart for Silver. Lugia, thought to be the guardian of the sea, resides deep in the ocean floor. It spends most of its time at the bottom of the sea due to its tremendous power, which includes being able to topple houses just by flapping its large, powerful wings and the ability to start storms that can last for over forty days. It is usually seen near the beginning of storms, and it often uses its wings to calm them.
It plays the role of a general legendary Pokémon in some games, where it waits in a far-off location, ready to battle. Lugia is one of the main characters of Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness. The storyline of the game depicts a "Shadow" Lugia terrorizing the locals and wreaking havoc. It is the only Shadow Pokémon whose physical appearance is different from its regular state. Shadow Lugia is said to be struggling, asking for help to free it from doing Cipher`s work in which "its deeper closed heart refuses to do". The player has to catch and Purify it for it to return to its original state.
In Pokémon: The Movie 2000, Lugia comes from the sea when the three Legendary Birds Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres are roused by a Pokémon collector who tries to catch the trio. Lugia then battles the raging Birds and, with the help of Ash and Team Rocket, manages to calm them and restore peace to nature. Lugia makes a second appearance in the Pokémon TV series when the protagonist, Ash, travels to the Whirl Islands where he meets his friend Richie to help stop a Team Rocket scientist from separating a young Lugia named "Silver" from her parent.</description>

<description>Ho-Oh is a legendary Pokémon that first appears in Pokémon Gold and Silver, appearing on Gold`s boxart. Long ago in Ecruteak City, there were two towers, the Brass Tower and Tin Tower being the roost of Lugia and Ho-Oh, respectively. When the Brass Tower burned down, both Pokémon fled, never to be seen again. Three Pokémon became trapped in the flames of the Brass Tower and perished. Ho-Oh returned to the Burned Tower and resurrected the three Pokémon, who were renamed Raikou, Entei, and Suicune. It has an unknown gender. On Gold, it is Lv40 when caught while it is Lv70 when caught in Silver. It is better to have the lower version as the move tutor does not exist in Gold/Silver.
It is called the Rainbow Pokémon due to its various associations with rainbows. Its feathers constantly change through the rainbow`s spectrum of colors as light hits them from different angles. These leave a rainbow trail as it flies continuously through the world`s skies, though it is said to live at the foot of a rainbow. It is said to appear before pure-hearted trainers as the representative of the bonds between humans and Pokémon, and bring happiness to all that see it. This is expanded upon in the anime, where it is said to appear before a hero. Ash Ketchum sees Ho-Oh various times throughout his journey, the first time being before Gold and Silver were even announced. It remained a mystery until it was revealed in Pokémon Gold.</description>

<description>Sceptile is the final evolution of Treecko. Sceptile`s power is unmatched in the jungle, and they are thus the dominant species in such environments. Sceptile`s bodies are configured for battling prowess and superior mobility in jungle environments, with large, sharp leaves protruding from their arms and legs that can easily cut large trees. As caretakers of the forest, these Pokémon carefully grow trees and plants with loving care. The orb-like seeds on a Sceptile`s back are filled to the brim with nutrients, which Sceptile use to revitalize the trees in their care. Sceptile regulate their body temperature by basking in sunlight.
In the anime Battle Frontier saga, Ash`s Grovyle evolves into a Sceptile during a battle with a Tropius. Even after evolution, Sceptile retains its rebellious personality. Ash`s Sceptile is initially unable to use any attacks, due to the psychological impact of a Meganium`s rejection. However, it regains the ability to use its attacks, and it later learns the SolarBeam attack.</description>

<description>Zigzagoon is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation III.
It evolves into Linoone starting at level 20.
In Galar, Zigzagoon has a Dark/Normal-type regional form. It evolves into Galarian Linoone starting at level 20, which evolves into Obstagoon when leveled up at night starting at level 35.
Zigzagoon is a raccoon-like, quadruped Pokémon with bristly, zigzag-patterned fur. It has stripes formed by alternating layers of cream and brown fur. It has a brown head with spiky ears and a black nose. A black, mask pattern surrounds its brown eyes. The upper half of its mouth is jagged, and when it is open, there are two pointed teeth in its lower jaw. Its feet have three claws and pink paw pads. Its forefeet are cream-colored, but the hind feet are brown. Its brush tail is spiky and bristly.
In Galar, the oldest and original form of Zigzagoon have a more black and white patterned-fur. The red eyes are surrounded by a black spiked mask. The black feet contains three sharp white claws. It has a long pink tongue that is constantly standing outside of mouth with two lower teeth in between.
Zigzagoon is abundantly curious, as it wanders restlessly back and forth while rubbing its nose to the ground in search of something. It rubs its bristly back hair against trees to mark its territory, and plays dead to fool opponents in battle. Zigzagoon is found commonly in grassy fields. The Zigzagoon in Galar are known to be constantly on the move and never settling down. It is believed that the zigzag movements of the Zigzagoon from other regions originated from its Galar relatives. They enjoy battling to the point they often attempt to prove others into fighting it. While this succeeded with other Pokémon, humans instead mistaken it wanting affection, much to the Zigzagoon`s frustrations.</description>

Linoone is a slender-bodied, quadruped Pokémon. Most of its fur is white, but it has several brown stripes.

It has sharp, elongated claws and small pointed teeth. It has small, tuft-like ears, long cheek fur, and blue eyes.
Linoone can run up to 60 miles per hour, but has to stop before it can make a turn. It often fails to catch prey due to only being able to run in a straight line. When it sees prey underwater in ponds, it leaps in and uses its sharp claws to catch the prey. As shown in the anime, Linoone has an attraction to anything round, and will grab any orb-shaped object it sees if given the chance. It often carries a snatched object in its expandable cheek pouches and deposits it in any of a number of secret stashes it keep on its territory. Linoone tends to live in grasslands.

By charging at up to 60 miles per hour, it can deliver powerful Tackles and Headbutts with enough destructive force to even knock away a car. Linoone can be thrown off balance should it miss, however.</description>

<description>Beautifly is a butterfly Pokémon and one of two flying insect Pokémon forms that Wurmple can eventually take. It can be considered a modern counterpart to the earlier butterfly Pokémon species Butterfree, but it is definitely the physical counterpart to Dustox, the other form into which a Wurmple can eventually evolve. Beautifly is a very vain and colorful butterfly with a long, coiled, needle-like mouth not unlike the proboscis of a real butterfly, which it uses both for gathering pollen in the wild and, despite their gentle appearance, for aggressively attacking opponent Pokémon when angered. It is most active in the springtime, where it rides the spring winds as it flits around gathering pollen from flower-covered fields, or from potted flowers left on windowsills.
In the Pokémon anime, Beautifly becomes May`s primary Pokémon for use in Pokémon contests early on, and Jessie`s Dustox is established as its rival.</description>

Nuzleaf is a forest-dwelling Pokémon that is skilled at climbing trees, though they occasionally venture out of the forest to startle people. They live in holes bored in large trees. Its long and pointed nose is its weak point, and it loses power if the nose is gripped. For this reason, it dislikes having its long nose pinched. Nuzleaf will sometimes pull out the leaf on its head and make a flute with it. The sound of Nuzleaf`s flute strikes fear and uncertainty in the hearts of people lost in a forest. This is a reference to Pan, the Greek god of the forest.</description>

This uniquely proportioned pelican is usually found by or over oceans or other large bodies of water. It builds its nest on high cliffs facing the sea, and is able to rest on top of waves to regain energy. Pelipper skims the tops of waves while it hunts for its prey, which are typically fish Pokémon. When Pelipper spots its prey, it dips its large beak into the water and scoops it up. It then proceeds to swallow it whole. Pelipper also carries the eggs of its Wingull offspring inside its beak before and after they hatch. This provides the offspring with protection and, after they hatch, nourishment from the hunted food.</description>

Gardevoir has psychic powers including telekinesis and telepathy, and it also has the ability of precognition, enabling it to see into the future to detect incoming dangers. It moves by levitating itself, and can ignore gravity. Its powers are strong enough to the point where Gardevoir can disrupt the space-time continuum. By doing so, it can create a miniature black hole. Gardevoir has an unparalleled sense of concern for its Pokémon trainer, such that it will even give its own life for its trainer. The psychic powers that Gardevoir wields are at its height when it is protecting its trainer from a threat. In Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire and Pokémon Emerald, Wally uses a Gardevoir in the final battle in Victory Road.
Gardevoir also appears as a major character in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team.</description>

<description>Surskit is a bug-like species of Pokémon based on the water strider insect. It was introduced in the third generation of Pokémon media in the fictional Hoenn region. Surskit frequents lakes and ponds, and it has the ability to walk, or at least glide, on the water`s surface thanks to an oily substance secreted from the tips of its feet which modifies the water`s surface tension, thus allowing the water to support its weight. Surskit`s diet consists of the microscopic organisms that are found at the base of a lake ecosystem`s food chain. Surskit can also secrete a thick, sweet syrup resembling honey from the tip of its head. This sap is said to appeal to some species of Pokémon such as Heracross. Surskit usually secretes the syrup when it finds itself in danger. The exact reasoning behind this is unclear, but it may aim at attracting Pokémon which will drive the danger away to lick the syrup off Surskit`s head.</description>

Masquerain`s appearance is configured to resemble to a degree a large, scary face, with its two giant orange antennae resembling eyes and its red face and two black eyes resembling a red mouth with two black teeth. This serves as an intimidation tactic to ward off potential predators. The four parallelogram-shaped appendages on its bottom are its real wings, and their fast flapping motions give Masquerain the ability to fly forwards, sideways, and backwards like a helicopter. Masquerain can`t fly in rain, so it therefore shelters itself under large trees and leaves.</description>

<description>Breloom is the larger and more developed evolved form that a Shroomish can metamorph into. This diurnal herbivore that lives in fields and forests with leaves for Breloom to feed on. Its favorite climate conditions are sunlight-induced warmth and humidity, which is when Breloom is at its most active. Breloom`s body is configured for battling opponents in a competitive boxing fashion. Its stretchable arms are capable of extremely quick, rapid-fire punches that are virtually invisible, putting professional human boxers to shame (compare with Hitmonchan).
Spores are located within Breloom`s toadstool cap, and Breloom sprays and scatters these spores out of the red holes on its cap as its tool to debilitate and poison opponents. Also toxically sporous are the seeds on Breloom`s tail, which sometimes drop off and are grown back. These seeds let loose their sporous contents when Breloom thwacks an opponent with its tail, making the foe even more at risk of succumbing to poisoning. These seeds are horrid things to consume; a mere bite out of one of these seeds that may be lying around on the forest floor will cause the consumer`s stomach to rumble.
Breloom is notable as one of two final-form Pokemon to receive the attack Spore, a sleep-inducing move with an accuracy of 100.</description>

<description>Azurill, a species of Pokémon introduced shortly before the official start of the third generation of the Pokémon franchise as a "preview Pokémon", is the younger pre-evolved form of the Marill species introduced in the second generation. Its circular tail is large and rubbery, and Azurill`s playful nature causes it to often be seen bouncing and playing on its bouncy tail. The tail is vital both for survival in peacetime and self-defense in battle; It is packed full with nutrients that supply itself to Azurill`s body in order for it to grow. It is also a floatation device in water, much like the tails of its evolutions Marill and Azumarill. Its tail is about 1.3x as large as its body. Azurill`s most intriguing habit with its tail involves spinning its tail as if it were a lasso, then hurling it out with intense force. The momentum of the throw sends its body flying, too. Using this unique mode of travel, one individual Azurill was seen to hurl itself a record 33 feet.
In the Pokémon RPGs, Azurill can only be acquired by hatching an egg produced by Marill holding the Sea Incense item. In the Pokémon anime, trainer Misty owns one after her previous "baby" Pokémon, Togepi, evolved into Togetic and departed. This Azurill is the offspring of Tracey`s Marill. It is shown to have a sweet and caring nature and loves to play with the other Pokémon.</description>

<description>Wailord is a gigantic, oceanic mammal with the largest known size of all Pokémon. Living in the vast oceans of the Pokémon world, Wailord swims languorously in pods of about four members or more, often at the surface so it can breathe through its upper nostrils. With huge mouths these Pokémon can eat massive amounts of undersea food, such as krill, in a single gulp. When chasing somewhat larger prey, Wailord herd them by leaping out of the water and making humongous splashes in what is often described as a breathtaking display. If a Wailord inhales to the maximum capacity of its gigantic lungs, it is able to dive close to 10,000 feet below the surface. Optionally by puffing itself up, it can float high on the ocean surface or beach on a shoreline if it wishes.</description>

<description>Flygon has its natural habitat in the desert, across which it flies. Flygon`s wings kick up a cloud of dust and sand each time they flap, so that whenever Flygon moves, it is surrounded by a constant sandstorm. This provides Flygon with a useful cover from enemies and other unwanted visitors who lose themselves in the dust cloud, while Flygon itself maintains perfect vision thanks to red covers that shield its eyes from the storm. But it is at a disadvantage in the jungle because the trees are so close together they cover almost the entire floor of the jungle from a bird`s-eye view. This Pokémon is known as "The Desert Spirit." When inside a Flygon-created sandstorm, the only thing one is aware of is the melodious sound of Flygon`s wings, which can resemble the notes of a song. Because of this, and the Pokédex related cry, it is thought that perhaps Flygon has the ability to buzz its wings at a rapid pace to create a melody.</description>

<description>Lunatone is a floating, sentient meteorite in the iconic shape of a crescent, instead of a moon. Its body is a stone-like beige color, and it has two large, intimidating eyes, one on either side. It also sports a rather odd, beak-like protuberance in the middle of the crescent.
Lunatone was first discovered forty years ago in Meteor Falls, a cave in Hoenn, its only known habitat. Meteor Falls, as its name suggests, is full of meteorites and the craters left by them as they impacted the planet`s surface, suggesting that Lunatone (and Solrock) as partners, have their origins in outer space. Lunatone is greatly connected to the moon, and its vitality ebbs and flows depending on the lunar cycle. Lunatone`s power and activity is greatest during the full moon, and weakest during the day and when the moon is new. Anyone who looks at its glowing red eyes becomes transfixed with fear.</description>

<description>Solrock resembles a large orange spherical rock with yellow outgrowths all around and a pair of flat, textured eyes. The appearance of the Pokémon is the iconic shape of the sun.
Solrock, apparently a meteorite whose origins appear to be from outer space, is expressionless, yet is somewhat sentient. It was discovered along with Lunatone in Meteor Falls, a site where a rain of meteorites impacted the ground. The Pokemon`s solar connections are apparent in battle: It absorbs solar power during the day and unleashes the sunlight as a concentrated beam of energy as its main weapon (compare with Venusaur). Since it also carries Psychic powers, Solrock can also sense what the foe is thinking. Solrock and Lunatone are counterparts. Lunatone represents the moon and Solrock represents the sun.</description>

<description>Claydol is known as the "Clay Doll Pokemon". It is imbued with a high degree of telekinetic power. It is always using telekinesis to keep itself afloat above the surface of the ground, whether it is traveling, standing still, or even sleeping. Its screw-shaped arms are separate objects that are connected to its body through telekinesis, and they float around Claydol`s body on Claydol`s accord. In battle, it positions its arms out in front and shoots lateral beams at its targets. The species originates from a doll or a statue made of mud and clay by primitive humans, of an ancient civilization dating back around 20,000 years, and then was brought to life by exposure under a mysterious ray. Some believe it can control the elements. In the Hoenn region video games, they can be found in the Sky Tower.</description>

Those that see it are said to forget their combative spirits right away; in particularly strong cases of anger, however, a Milotic`s body can glow a vivid pink and release a pulsing wave of energy that brings soothing calm to the restless spirits of the people and Pokémon involved.
The evolution of Feebas into Milotic is unique within the Pokemon video games, in that a Feebas will only evolve into Milotic when its Beauty condition is sufficiently high.</description>

<description>Tropius live in the jungles of the southern tropics. It is a `frugivore`, thriving on fruit. It is theorized that Tropius`s love of fruit eventually resulted in the species incorporating fruit as part of its very anatomy. It may also be that Tropius eats so much fruit that it gets an excess of vitamins and minerals, so it grows fruit to get rid of excess nutrients. Bunches of banana-like fruit can be seen growing under a Tropius`s neck. These fruit are deliciously sweet and particularly popular among the children in south tropical villages, who eat it as snacks. Tropius also has broad leaves on its back, which, if flapped hard enough, can be used as wings, enabling this bulky Pokémon to fly.</description>

<description>Relicanth is a rare and inaccessible Pokémon, as it inhabits the deep ocean floor. Once thought to be extinct, it was discovered in an exploration mission of the sea abyss. Relicanth proved to be extremely well-adapted to its environment; so much so, that according to researchers in the Pokémon world, it has not changed form in 100,000,000 years. Relicanth`s body is covered in rock-like scales which are tough enough to withstand the enormous hydrostatic pressures exercised on it at such extreme depths, as is the case with other dwellers of the abyss. It uses its multiple pectoral fins as a means of locomotion across the sea bed. It is based on the real fish, the Coelacanth.</description>

<description>Salamence is very happy at its successful acquisition of wings, yearning for them since being a Bagon, and expresses its feelings by soaring all over the sky, blowing fire from its mouth. Salamence is just as easily expressive when enraged: when angry, it loses all thought and destroys everything around it with its fire breath and shredding claws. Salamence is a very strong Pokémon because of its incredible attack and special attack, and therefore highly desirable to trainers. However, Bagon and Shelgon, its two pre-evolved forms are difficult to train and level up.
Salamence (and its pre-evolved form Shelgon) cannot be found in the wild, so Salamence must be evolved from a Bagon which can be found in Hoenn`s Meteor Falls. However, Salamence was obtainable at a Nintendo promotional event in which it was given out to players with the rare move Wish.</description>

<description>Beldum lacks a circulatory system of blood. Instead, it is powered by a strong magnetic force. It can exert magnetic forces from its body in order to communicate with others of its species, and can even communicate with brain waves. Beldum move together in a synchronized pattern, attracted by the magnetism of one another. They can repel Earth`s natural magnetism with their own, allowing them to levitate. Beldum live on cliffs by planting their leg into the cliff-rock. Ash captures one in a city.</description>

<description>Metang is formed from two Beldum merging to form a Metang. This merge is more than a physical one; both Beldums` brains in a Metang are linked by a network of magnetic impulses, making Metang quite intelligent. The Beldum only manifest as the arms and eyes of the Metang; some other material must make up the head. With both Beldums` magnetic fields combined, Metang`s abilities manifest as telekinesis. Its telekinetic power allows it to hover a short distance above the ground, as well as fly at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour.
Metang doesn`t rely entirely on its magnetic telekinesis, however, as it already has a portion of the durability and strength of Metagross. Its metal carapace is tough enough to survive even cataclysmic explosions and can leave a collision from a jet plane without a scratch. Metang`s claws can rip through tempered steel.</description>

<description>Metagross is comprised by of two Metang forming together. Each leg is the body of a former Beldum, and its head/body is the four collective heads of Beldum used to fuse into it. Metagross`s intelligence is extraordinarily high: not only does it have four minds, but they are also connected by a highly complex neural network, which is nowadays a more accurate measure of the capacity for intelligence than the net amount of brain tissue. Its developed cerebral powers are said to surpass even those of a supercomputer. Metagross mostly relies on its massive strength. It can also use psychic abilities, including the ability to render its massive body airborne by telekinesis once it draws its legs together.
This Pokémon lives in mountainous areas. It can easily live comfortably on very steep slopes by planting its legs into rock or ground. Metagross is also a brutal predator. When hunting, it pins its prey to the ground under its massive body. It then eats the helpless victim using its large mouth on its underside.</description>

<description>Kyogre is one of a trio of legendary Pokémon, alongside Groudon and Rayquaza. Kyogre represents Pokémon Sapphire and appears on the cover art for the game. Kyogre represents the primal force of the oceans; as such, it has the power to bring forth storms, constant rain and massive floods. It is part of the creation myth of the Pokémon world. According to legend, a titanic battle between it and Groudon created the oceans and the land, and the two were sealed beneath their respective elements. Despite being the creator of the oceans, Kyogre still came and helped Manaphy when it needed help as any other regular Pokémon would. Kyogre is similar to an orca or killer whale. It is a Water-type with the ability Drizzle, which makes the weather rainy until another weather move is used or a Pokémon with another weather altering ability is switched in.
In Pokémon Sapphire, Team Aqua tries to awaken and control Kyogre. It is awakened by a blue orb that the group actively seeks. They eventually awaken Kyogre, but they are stopped by the player in the video games. Kyogre made its first movie appearance in the ninth Pokémon movie, Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea. In the movie, Kyogre helps Ash, May, Pikachu, and Manaphy to protect the Sea Temple and defeat The Phantom.</description>

<description>Groudon is one of a trio of legendary Pokémon, alongside Kyogre and Rayquaza, that represents Pokémon Ruby and appears on its cover art. In the legend surrounding the three, Groudon represents the land, while Kyogre and Rayquaza represent the sea and the sky, respectively. Groudon, representing land, raised lands and expanded continents in legend. Coming as a savior for humans suffering from floods caused by Kyogre, it can dissipate clouds, and evaporate water with light and heat. After a titanic battle with Kyogre, it went to sleep in underground magma, causing volcanoes to erupt when it awakes. It is a Ground-type with the Drought ability, which makes the weather sunny until another weather move is used or a Pokémon with another weather-altering ability is switched in.
Groudon first appears in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire and Pokémon Emerald along with Kyogre and Rayquaza. Pokémon Ruby focuses on Team Magma awakening Groudon to take over the world, while Pokémon Emerald has both Groudon and Kyogre awake. The anime follows a similar structure, where both Pokémon are awakened, and forced to battle by Team Magma and Team Aqua. This is foiled by Ash Ketchum and Lance, and Groudon and Kyogre return to their respective elements after calling a truce. Groudon also plays a pseudo-role in the sixth Pokémon movie, Jirachi Wishmaker, where an evil being in the form of a Groudon is formed from the energy of Jirachi.</description>

<description>Rayquaza is one of a trio of legendary Pokémon, alongside Kyogre and Groudon, that represents Pokémon Emerald and appears on its cover art. In the legend surrounding the three, Rayquaza represents the sky, while Kyogre and Groudon represent the sea and the land, respectively. Rayquaza resides within the ozone layer of the Earth and has lived there for hundreds of millions of years without ever descending. To those who have observed Rayquaza from the surface of the planet, Rayquaza has always appeared to be a zooming meteor. Rayquaza feeds on water and particles in the Earth`s atmosphere. It is said to only descend from the ozone layer if Kyogre and Groudon were to fight, in order to end the feud and maintain the balance of nature.
In Pokémon Emerald, Rayquaza is seen in a series of cutscenes. Once the player progresses past the Magma and Aqua Hideouts, Kyogre and Groudon wake up and start fighting, with the Red and Blue Orbs unable to control them. It is eventually sought out at the Sky Pillar, and eventually forces the two to cease their battle. Rayquaza appears as a boss character in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games, where the main team has to fight it in order to have it annihilate a falling star hurtling towards the planet.
Rayquaza is featured in the seventh Pokémon movie, Destiny Deoxys. Four years prior to the main events of the movie, Rayquaza is nearly injured in the ozone layer by the passage of a meteor containing the essence of Deoxys. Rayquaza seemingly destroys the Deoxys afterwards, but it is eventually revived. Rayquaza goes after it again, but after being rescued by it, Rayquaza decides that it isn`t an enemy, and returns to the atmosphere.</description>

<description>Deoxys (pronounced /di`ɑks.ɪs/) is a Pokémon formed from a mutation of a extraterrestrial virus exposed to a laser beam. It has psychokinetic powers and a high intelligence along with a crystalline organ on its chest that acts as its brain and shoots lasers. It has the ability to transform into four different forms, each with a specific purpose: Normal, Attack, Defense, and Speed. In the third generation of games, the form is based upon the game the Deoxys is contained within. As of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, it can freely change by interacting with the four meteorites in Veilstone City.
Deoxys` name is based on "Deoxyribonucleic acid", or DNA, which is the base of all life and contains instructions for every part of it.
Deoxys first appeared in the seventh Pokémon film, http://anidb.net/a2371 [Pokémon: Destiny Deoxys]. In the film, it demonstrated the ability to switch between its forms, create shadow copies for use as drones, regenerate missing body parts, launch an aurora into the sky, and erect a city-size force field which keeps nearly every sort of machine within from operating. The film also demonstrated that Deoxys is not a one-of-a-kind unique species like Rayquaza; more than one Deoxys is seen.
In early 2005, NASA began a cross-promotion with Nintendo and the Pokémon Company to provide an "edutainment" program for children across the United States by Internet, teaching the science behind various Pokémon characters as they appear in Trading Card Game expansions. In the first segment of the program, based on the newly-released EX: Deoxys Trading Card Game expansion, they used the character of Deoxys to teach children about outer space, anatomy of a virus, the meaning of DNA, the existence of the ozone layer, and a definition of an extraterrestrial. Since then the program has had two other segments covering the next two expansions: EX Emerald and EX Unseen Forces.

Collars of the female are noticeably larger than those of the male.
Also, it should be noticed that the antenna of Kricketot appear to be a raised version of Kricketune`s mustache.

It also has two large whiskers resembling a handlebar mustache above the nose. The "mustache" on the female is slightly smaller than the male`s. Kricketot`s name originates from the words cricket, spelled with a "K," and tune, as in a musical tune.
Its appearance resembles a violin, or double bass, with string-like lines on its neck. Due to these traits, its design could have been influenced by the real life violin beetle. But with its scythes, or bows (for a violin), it could most likely be instrument-designed, like its pre-evolution, Kricketot.
Because of it`s musical nature, Nando owns one as well.</description>

The legend says that it had unbelievable strength, but seemingly since it has not used it in ages, it has trouble getting its act together at the beginning of a battle, evidenced by its ability, Slow Start. In Platinum, Regigigas` level is reduced to 1, making it the lowest level non-glitch wild &amp; legendary Pokémon, more evidence of the fact that it has not used its powers for millennia.</description>

<description>Jessie is one half of of the Team Rocket duo that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokemon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
Jessie`s mother, Miyamoto, was a high-ranking Team Rocket agent. When Jessie was around the age of three, Miyamoto left on a mission to the Andes Mountains to record the voice of the elusive Pokemon Mew. However, Miyamoto disappeared, and Jessie was put into a foster home which had very little money. There were times when she had no choice but to eat snow because of a lack of more nourishing food.
When she was old enough, she left home to become a Pokemon nurse in Jouto. However, the school she was enrolled in was literally for Pokemon nurses (i.e. Chansey), so she failed to graduate and left, leaving behind a Chansey she had befriended there. It is assumed that she then traveled back to Kanto, where she enrolled in Pokemon Tech, a trainer`s school, met James, and subsequently failed and dropped out. After this, Jessie and James joined a bicycle gang in Sunny Town, where Jessie was known for swinging a chain above her head as she rode her bike (nicknamed "Chainer Jess").
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between Jessie and James after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Sometime before joining Team Rocket, and it is not known when, Jessie obtained a Contest Pass in the Hoenn region. Also during the years before Team Rocket, she had several boyfriends, all of whom left her and/or treated her badly. In "Xatu the Future", she revealed that she had once worked at a T.V. station as the Weathergirl. In "From Cradle to Save" is also revealed that she once was a ninja.
She has a long-standing bitter rivalry with Cassidy, another member of Team Rocket. Another member, Wendy, held a grudge against Jessie for failing to pay for a drink (making Wendy pay), but got her revenge when she added the charge to Jessie`s overall Team Rocket bill.
In the episode "Ignorance is Blissey", Jessie was reunited with her friend Chansey from the Pokemon nurse school; Chansey had since evolved into a Blissey.
Starting in Hoenn, Jessie has become a Pokemon Coordinator, entering every contest that she could. She frequently makes it to the battle round, but usually loses there. However, in "Borrowing on Bad Faith", she finally succeeded in winning an (unofficial) contest by using Ash`s Aipom, which she had saved earlier in the episode. And, in "Team Shocker!", she finally wins an official contest with her Dustox in at Solaceon City. Later she also won a ribbon with help of her Yanmega. She has Contest Passes to compete in the Hoenn, Kanto, and Sinnoh regions.
While Jessie`s role in the Pokemon anime has not yet ended, in Toshihiro Ono`s manga, "The Electric Tale of Pikachu", she ended up married to James and with child.
Jessie seems to have a special preference for snake-like Pokemon, owning both an Arbok and a Seviper. In "The Ninja Poke Showdown", she expressed a preference for Poison-type Pokemon in general.
For unknown reasons, she, James and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation.
In the Kanto contests, Jessie disguises herself as Jessebella (which is similar to James former fiancee Jessiebelle) wearing a red dress and glasses. Eventually, Ash, Brock, Max and May finds out her true identity at the last contest.
During the Kanto Grand Festival, Jessie dresses up as Jessadia (Japanese: キャンディ・ムサリーナ Candy Musalina). and wears glasses, long white socks, a yellow and orange dress, and has her hair in pigtails. She works there as an announcer and Lilian Meridian`s assistant; Lilian herself says she may not really like "Jessadia"`s style, but recognizes her talent. In the Latin American dub, she enters Super Contests under the name Jessiebella (referencing Jessiebelle again). Jessie currently still continues to use the Jessalina disguise while participating in Super Contests.
In "Pruning a Passel of Pals!" and "Strategy With a Smile!" she once again used her Jessadia disguise to report on the Wallace Cup.
Although Jessie had entered mostly every contest in Hoenn &amp; Kanto, she lost in every single one, whether it was the first match of the Battle Rounds or the finals. But in the Sinnoh Region, she has so far won 2 ribbons using her Dustox and Yanmega.</description>

<description>Meowth is a very unique Pokémon as it has many of the characteristics of a human. It walks on two feet, talks and is as smart as any human. Meowth is currently a member of Team Rocket and he travels around with Jessie and James trying to capture Pikachu and other rare Pokémon for Giovanni.
Meowth generally finishes his sentences with "Nyaa (ニャー)" which is the equivalent of "meow" in English. This helps people remember that despite his ability to talk like a human, he still has cat character traits.
Meowth is also known for coming up with his many schemes to try to capture Pikachu. While Jessie and James always agree with Meowth and think his plans are brilliant, they are generally foiled by Ash and his friends.
Long Con to Access Raimon City Pokémon Center
Meowth schemed with Jessie, James and Doctor Zager to figure out a way for them to infiltrate the Raimon City Pokémon Center where high-leveled Pokémon are stored in a vault that is protected by a security machine scan system that would only open if Nurse Joy (Isshu) or Nurse Joy`s Audino were scanned. Meowth pretended to be no longer part of Team Rocket making up a story that his made an error while executing a certain operation and when headquarters hear of his mistake, they told him he was fired.
Ash, Iris and Cilan believed him and allowed Meowth to travel with him. Pikachu though didn`t trust Meowth even though Meowth proved on numerous occasion that it should be trusted. Meowth`s plan was put into action when they arrived at the Raimon City Pokémon Center and as soon as Nurse Joy`s Audino was scanned to open the door, Meowth turned on Pikachu and the other and captured all the Pokémon in the vault. The long con had been a success and Meowth met up with Jessie and James below the Pokémon Center. Unfortunately, they weren`t able to get away as Ash and his friends realized that Meowth had just been conning them and they were able to stop Team Rocket.</description>

<description>James is one part of of the Team Rocket trio that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokémon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
James is mostly a comedic parody of bishounen characters; the English dub in particular tends to give him a melodramatic and even campy tone. He is somewhat famous for carrying a rose, though in more recent episodes he does not display it often. Mostly, his rose is displayed in the Team Rocket motto.
The only child of millionaires, James was forced to endure formal society. At a young age, he was forcefully engaged to a girl of whom he was terrified, Jessiebelle, all because his parents wanted to have a wealthy daughter-in-law. Thus, he ran away from home, leaving behind his beloved pet Growlie. He attempted to enroll in Pokémon Tech, a trainer`s school, but, along with his new friend Jessie, flunked out. Then, with Jessie, he joined the Sunny Town bicycle gang, where he was popular for being the only gang member to have to use training wheels (nicknamed "Trainer Jim"). Eventually James, Jessie, and the bike gang went their separate ways.
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between James and Jessie after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Since he is proficient in several activities, including Pokémon haiku and PokéRinger, it is possible that he developed his skills during his temporary separation from Jessie, but this is not known for sure.
In the episode "Holy Matrimony!", James returned to his home as a result of a trap by his parents, who pretended to be dead. He was reunited with his old pet Growlie and managed to avoid marrying Jessiebelle. Growlie stayed behind when James returned to Jessie and Meowth.
James has a tendency to be swindled by a Magikarp Salesman, who has on many occasions tricked him into buying a Magikarp or other useless Pokémon and items for large sums of money.
James also has a tendency to cross-dress, but has not done it since "Pros and Con Artists". He does, however, dress up like famous celebrities as well, such as Professor Oak, Juan, and Norman.
James loves rare bottle caps and has an impressive collection of them. In the episode "All That Glitters!" it is revealed that he has "drunk enough soda pop to float an aircraft carrier".
For unknown reasons, he, Jessie and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation. However in newer episodes the balloon is shown with `jets` attached to explain how they get from one place to another faster than walking.</description>

<description>The Beginning
Ash is the main character of the Pokémon anime. Raised in Pallet Town, he started his journey to become a Pokémon Master at the age of 10. On the day that he started his journey, Ash carelessly woke up late despite being told by his mother, Delia Ketchum to get to bed. He rushed to Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory only to find out that the beginner Pokémon - Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander - had already been given out to trainers who arrived on time. However, Professor Samual Oak mentioned that there was one more Pokémon available - Pikachu. Despite constantly hitting Ash with Electric-type attacks and refusing to return to its PokéBall, Ash decided to take Pikachu along with him on his journey to become a Pokémon Master. Pikachu is cold towards Ash at first and laughs at his failures; however, when Ash saves Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow, he begins to warm up to his new trainer and the two finally become friends. After the battle with the flock of Spearow, a Ho-Oh is seen flying towards a rainbow in the sky. The PokéDex reveals that the Ho-Oh is an unidentified Pokémon. Thus, the journey of Ash and Pikachu begins.
Captures in Viridian Forest
While making his way towards Pewter City and his first Kanto League Gym Battle, Ash came upon a wild Caterpie deep within Viridian Forest. Instead of using Pikachu to battle against the wild Pokémon, Ash took his chances and threw a PokéBall without weakining the Caterpie first. Luckily, he was able to catch the Pokémon without any trouble. The capture of Ash`s Caterpie marked Ash`s first capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Caterpie the second Pokémon to join his team.
The next day, while continuing the trek through the Viridian Forest, Ash came up on a wild Pidgeotto. He tried to just throw a PokéBall like he did with Ash`s Caterpie, but Pidgeotto swatted the PokéBall away. Misty informed that he must weaken the Pokémon first before attempting to capture it. He called out Ash`s Caterpie to battle against, but Misty quickly informed him that Bug-type Pokémon are weak against Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeotto. After Pidgeotto dealt significant damage to Ash`s Caterpie, Ash recalled it and sent out Pikachu. Pikachu was able to use its Thundershock to weaken Pidgeotto and allow Ash to capture it with a PokéBall. Thus, this capture marked Ash`s second capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Pidgeotto the third Pokémon to join his team.
Later on, while still in the Viridian Forest, Ash was approached by Team Rocket, who attempted to steal his Pokémon. After defeating Meowth, James`s Koffing, and Jessie`s Ekans, Ash`s Caterpie evolved into Ash`s Metapod.
Some of Ash`s greatest accomplishments have been at the various Pokémon Leagues. He was the victor at the Orange League and the Battle Frontier. He also competed in the Indigo League and the Johto Silver Conference where he placed admirably in both those competitions as well.
Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup
Ash participated in the Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup at the Kagome Town stadium. In the first round he was in the fifth match and faced off against Marris. The match was quickly showcased and Ash won the battle and advanced to the second round while Marris was eliminated from the tournament.
The Isshu League
Ash participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where he was matched up against Trip. Trip`s Serperior was sent out to battle Pikachu and Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior`s speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter Trip`s Serperior speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round. The two met in the Pokémon Center after the battle, and Trip vowed that the next time they met that he would win. The two shook hands and parted ways.
In the first main round, Ash`s opponent was shown on the match up electronic board but not much else is known about the battle. Ash`s Scraggy participated in the second main round of the Isshu League tournament where it faced off against a Darumakka. It was able to defeat it so that moved on to the next round.
In the third round, Stephan was matched up against Ash. Cilan noted that the two of them have a very direct taste and that it would be a good battle. It was only a 3 on 3 battle but the both of them gave it their all. The first two battles of the third round setup the final match up of Stephan`s Sawk vs Ash`s Krookodile, both of which were very injured from the previous battles. Both of them did their best to muster up their reserve strength but in the end a surprise move of Aerial Ace by Ash`s Krookodile was super effective against Stephan`s Sawk and it knocked it out to give Ash the victory while eliminating Stephan from the tournament. Stephan realized after the battle that the reason that Ash withdrew Waruvial after the first battle was because Ash knew that Stephan would definitely send out Dageki, so he didn`t reveal that it knew Aerial Ace and saved until the end.</description>

<description>The Beginning
On the morning that Ash was to start his Pokémon journey, he woke up late and by the time he reached Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory, all of the beginner Pokémon were already taken. However, Professor Samual Oak did have one Pokémon left, a wild Pikachu. At first, Pikachu did not like Ash and would refuse to enter his PokéBall. He would often laugh at Ash`s failures and refused to listen to him. However, after Ash proved his loyalty to Pikachu by protecting him from a flock of Spearow, and thus began to earn Pikachu`s trust and respect. The two have since become best friends and Pikachu never leaves Ash`s side.
Since the day Team Rocket first encountered Pikachu, it has been their sole goal to capture it. Day after day, their plan to capture Pikachu has been thwarted mainly due to Pikachu`s amazingly powerful Thunderbolt that keeps on blasting them off.
On numerous occasions, Pikachu has made it evident that he is happy being a Pikachu and has no desire to evolve into a more powerful Raichu. It has proven time and time again that it is a powerful and worthy opponent to any Pokémon that dares to battle it.
Gym Battle against Burgh`s Leavanny
Pikachu was then sent out to battle Burgh`s Leavanny. Burgh`s Leavanny managed to tie up Pikachu with String Shot but unlike Ash`s Swadloon who was able to break free, Pikachu ended up getting hit with a couple of Leaf Storm attacks and a Hyper Beam before it rolled into another of Burgh`s Leavanny`s Leaf Storm attacks to break the string off its body so it could attack. Freed from the String Shot, Burgh`s Leavanny tried to tie it up again but Pikachu managed to avoid it with its speed and then knocked Burgh`s Leavanny out with a combination of Iron Tail and Electro Ball.
Gym Battle against Elesa
Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy and was then matched up with Pikachu. Pikachu made quick work of Elesa`s Emolga and knocked it out with one attack, its Iron Tail.
Elesa`s Tynamo was the last Pokémon that she used in her gym battle against Ash. It was matched up against Pikachu who had just defeated her Emonga. Pikachu had a hard time defending against the fast Tackle attack that Elesa`s Tynamo kept hitting it with but Pikachu used its Thunderbolt to create a large dust cloud leaving only a small corridor for Pikachu to focus on it and so Elesa`s Tynamo couldn`t maneuver out of the way. Pikachu one hit K.O`d Elesa`s Tynamo with a Iron Tail. The loss gave Ash the overall victory.
Battle against Alder`s Bouffalant
Ash challenged Alder to a battle and he accepted though he had been walking all night and was actually quite tired. Alder sent out his Buffron to battle Pikachu but just as the battle started, Alder fell asleep standing up and didn`t give any orders to his Buffron. Alder`s Bouffalant stood still as Pikachu began hitting it with attack after attack until it Alder`s Bouffalant finally got mad at Alder and charged at him and set him flying into a tree. After that, Alder`s Bouffalant no longer wished to battle and Alder conceded the battle.
Gym Battle against Skyla
In Skyla air battle simulation, Ash`s Tranquill was matched up against Skyla`s Unfezant and since her Pokémon was the highest evolved form, she determined that her Pokémon would be the winner in that match-up. In the actual gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was up against Skyla`s Unfezant which was the match-up just after Ash`s Tranquill had defeated Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla`s Unfezant proved to be stronger and faster than Ash`s Tranquill, so Ash recalled it and set out Pikachu. Pikachu had a definite advantage over Skyla`s Unfezant with its electric attacks and it quickly knocked it out with its Electro Ball attack.
Ash Just after Pikachu ended up knocking out Skyla`s Unfezant, Skyla`s Swanna was sent out to battle against it. Skyla had been watching her grandpa`s battle videos and noticed that he used the move Aqua Ring to defend against Electric attacks. She used that same defense against Pikachu which nullified its Electric attacks. It`s Iron Tail also couldn`t hit it so high in the air. Ash then noticed the rings in the air and Pikachu jumped up on them and managed to hit Skyla`s Swanna but not directly. Pikachu was now up in the air though and Skyla`s Swanna had the advantage there and it quickly knocked Pikachu out with a powerful Brave Bird attack.
Battle Against Trip`s Serperior at the Isshu League
Pikachu participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where it is was matched up against Trip`s Serperior. Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter its speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round.</description>

<description>While Wobbuffet is technically Jessie`s Pokémon, it has been around so long that it has become a main character, appearing in almost every episode of the series since it debut.
Wobbuffet was first seen walking around with Benny, his previous trainer. Jessie traded her Lickitung for Wobbuffet and it has been with her ever since that day.
Wobbuffet rarely battles but when he does, his Counter and Mirror Coat moves have proved to be very effective. Unfortunately, Jessie`s tactics aren`t always sufficient to master Wobbuffet`s superior defensive skills.
Wobbuffet also randomly comes out of his Pokeball, especially during the Team Rocket motto. He is also seen blasting off with Jessie regardless if he was actually part of the action.</description>

<description>When Ash and co. were traveling towards Daybreak Town for Dawn`s next Pokémon Contest, a mysterious Pokémon Trainer specializing in martial arts, named Clayton, challenged Ash and his Buizel to a battle after seeing how Buizel saved Gible who had fallen into a river. Clayton`s Mr. Mime proved to be a really strong opponent, though, as it managed to dodge Buizel`s Aqua Jet and SonicBoom attacks by skillfully using its Psychic and Double Team moves, eventually knocking Buizel out with a powerful ThunderPunch. Ash and Buizel, determined to make up for the loss by getting stronger, started training with Clayton`s help so that Buizel could learn a new move; Ice Punch. He told them that, in order to master the move, they had to work on improving their speed and concentration.
At first, the progress of Ash`s Buizel`s training seemed to be really slow. However, after training overnight using unstable and light objects as targets for its punches, like floating leaves, Buizel managed to master the move completely. After the completion of Buizel`s training, Ash challenged Clayton to a rematch, and Clayton accepted. Ash`s Buizel proved to be more of a challenge for its opponent, Mr. Mime, this time and after activating its ability, Swift Swim, in the midst of the battle due to a sudden rain, Buizel managed to increase its speed and finish Clayton`s Mr. Mime off with a powerful Ice Punch. Clayton then acknowledged Ash`s Buizel`s improvement and praised its skills, but also put emphasis on the fact that Buizel still had a long way to go and had to keep on training.</description>

<description>Paul is a rival of Ash in the Sinnoh region. He has a very closed personality and doesn`t make friends very easily. He strives to find the strongest Pokémon he can possibly find and if they don`t meet his expectations he releases them.
He faced Ash in a full battle and managed to defeat him by using some of his older Pokémon where as Ash only used Pokémon that he had caught in the Sinnoh region save only Pikachu. The two of them made a pact to have a rematch at the Sinnoh League.
The two faced off in the quarter-final round of the Sinnoh League. Ash took the early lead by defeating Paul`s Aggron and Gastrodon. Paul fought back though defeating Buoysel, Staraptor and Torterra in a row. Infernape proved to be a powerful opponent and was able to defeat Paul. A bond between Ash and Paul was formed as they both began to respect each other after the battle.
After loosing to Ash in the Sinnoh League, Paul returned home and then challenged Brandon of the Battle Frontier.</description>

<description>Kenny is a Pokémon Coordinator and has known Dawn since they were young children. Like Dawn, he is also from Twinleaf Town. He is constantly teasing Dawn and calling her Dee Dee, Pikari (ピカリ), a nickname he came up with one day after she got shocked by the classes Plusle and Minun which caused her hair to go all frizzly and sparkle. "Pikapika" is an onomatopoeia for "sparkling" and she was given the nickname by him.
After obtaining the 5 required ribbons, he participated in the Sinnoh Grand Festival at the Lakeside Resort. Unfortunately he was unable to advance past the Appeal round as his Empoleon`s Luster Cannon proved to be too powerful for his Floatzel to defend.</description>

Before he could capture the energy from the second ripple, Zorua was able to damage his Illusion Canceller to make him susceptible to Zoroark`s Illusion ability once again. Kurt was able to record the events that transpired as Kodai confessed that he was the one responsible for the Crown City disaster. Kodai was captured and sent to prison.</description>

<description>Rowena was Grings Kodai`s secretary. Goone introduced her to Grings Kodai but Grings Kodai had a vision that she would be one of the people that would betray him while attempting to capture the second ripple of time energy. Though he knew of her eventual betrayal, he did not mention it to her and allowed her to have the job as her secretary.
Rowena did `betray` Grings Kodai when she learned about the plot to use Zoroark to cause terror in Crown City. She met Karl and Ash and together they were able to stop Grings Kodai. Grings Kodai recognized his vision had come to pass when Rowena showed up at the large tree in Crown City with the others to stop him. She told him that she didn`t need to be paid for her work. Rowena was able to give Karl and Ash the insider information that would help prove that Grings Kodai was guilty for the crimes he had committed.</description>
