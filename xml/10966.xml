<description>One hundred years ago, Dahara City was beset by a terrible calamity brought on by a great power. The city was saved when a mysterious man sealed that power in the Prison Bottle, and became peaceful.
In the present, Ash and his friends arrive in Dahara City, where they meet the mischievous Pokémon Hoopa as well as its human companion Mary. However, when Mary`s elder brother Barza discovers the Prison Bottle in the desert and multiple Legendary Pokémon appear in the city, the battle of a century ago restarts, triggering a cataclysm that forces the appearance of even more Legendary Pokémon, drawing Arceus into the fray.

<name>Pikachu</name>
<gender>dimorphic</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Pikachu is an Electric-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Pichu when leveled up with high friendship and evolves into Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone. However, the starter Pikachu in Pokémon Yellow will refuse to evolve into Raichu unless it is traded and evolved on another save file.
In Alola, Pikachu will evolve into Alolan Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone.
It also has a Gigantamax form.
Pikachu is popularly known as the mascot of the Pokémon franchise and a major representative of Nintendo`s collective mascots.
It is also the game mascot and starter Pokémon of Pokémon Yellow and Pokémon: Let`s Go, Pikachu!. It has made numerous appearances on the boxes of spin-off titles.
Pikachu is also the starter Pokémon in Pokémon Rumble Blast and Pokémon Rumble World.
Pikachu is a short, chubby rodent Pokémon. It is covered in yellow fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back. It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch for electricity storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is a patch of brown fur. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs.
The anime has shown that wild Pikachu live in groups in forested areas. Pikachu communicate amongst themselves using squeaks and tail-shaking as friendly gestures. In the anime, Alolan Pikachu are known to greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Electricity can be used to receive and send messages with each other, as well as other Electric Pokémon species. It raises its tail to check its surroundings and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups grow, they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. Pikachu forages for Berries, which it roasts with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that Pikachu inhabits a location is patches of burnt grass. It has been observed eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment.
Pikachu charges itself while sleeping overnight, though stress and a lack of sleep can affect this. It is able to release electric discharges of varying intensity. Pikachu has been known to build up energy in its glands, which it will need to discharge to avoid complications. It is also able to release energy through its tail, which acts as a grounding rod, as well as recharging fellow Pikachu with electric shocks. Pikachu can also electrify itself to use its signature move Volt Tackle.
Pikachu has three alternate forms: one, the Cosplay Pikachu appeared exclusively in Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. It is always female, has a black heart-shaped spot at the end of its tail, and can be dressed in any of five outfits corresponding to the five Contest conditions. The second form is Pikachu in a cap, which debuted as an event-exclusive Pokémon in Generation VII. It is always male and has seven variants, each wearing one of Ash`s hats from the anime. In addition to these two forms, many other Pikachu variants have appeared in various media. The last, Partner Pikachu is the Pokémon the player starts with in Pokémon: Let`s Go, Pikachu!. This Pikachu can be either gender, has higher base stats, and has access to moves that normal Pikachu do not.
As Gigantamax Pikachu, it becomes larger and chubbier. Its tail becomes longer and stores all of the electricity it generates, causing it to glow a bright yellow and enabling it to become as powerful as a lightning strike. Its power is equal to that a power plant; however, it is difficult to use it in peoples` homes since Pikachu can only remain in its Gigantamax form for a short time.
Pikachu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Catastropika, while Pikachu in a cap has its own exclusive Z-Move, 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt. Partner Pikachu is the only Pokémon capable of using Zippy Zap, Floaty Fall, Splishy Splash, and the Partner Power, Pika Papow. Pikachu is the only Pokémon capable of using the Light Ball item. Gigantamax Pikachu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Volt Crash.</description>

<description>Diglett is a basic mole-like creature that can be found only in Diglett`s Cave. Capable of burrowing at the speed of sound, it thrives in dark underground caves since exposure to bright light can weaken it. The burrow and excretions left by a Diglett, rather like those of a real-life earthworm, keep the soil aerated and fertile. For this reason, Diglett are prized by farmers.
The mysterious feet or hands of Diglett are unknown of what they look like, for the fact that Diglett can use moves such as slash and fury swipes. Only the head of a Diglett can be seen popping out of the ground.</description>

Like its pre-evolved form Diglett, Dugtrio`s feet have never been seen. People have only seen a Dugtrio`s head(s).</description>

<description>Dragonite is the final form of the Dratini evolutionary line. It evolves from Dragonair at level 55. Dragonite`s appearance is notably different from that of its previous forms. As Dragonite, it is now a golden bipedal dragon with a beige underbelly that extends from the top of its neck to the tip of its tail. Along with already being a Dragon-type, it has now gained the secondary Flying-type, growing wings. Dragonite is one of the fastest flying Pokémon, and "The fastest flying Pokémon" as of the first generation. It has a small horn on the top of its head, along with slightly "S" shaped antennae. However, much like its previous forms, Dragonite still has a gentle and somewhat innocent appearance. Its diet consists mainly of berries, soft plants, and fruit, while it will occasionally eat crustaceans, like Corphish and Krabby.
Dragonite are very loyal to any trainer they find worthy of acceptance. They are calm, gentle, and intelligent creatures, but when threatened can put their pudgy bulk to good use. Dragonite seem to have more advanced vocal abilities compared to other Pokémon in that they make several different types of calls, rather than just saying their name. They have been noted to save drowning swimmers and threatened sailors. Dragonites` speed is very varied; some Dragonite can have great speeds while other have very low/average speeds. It is said that Dragonite can circle the globe in less than 16 hours.
Dragonite`s main anime appearance was at the end of the Orange Island League season in "Enter The Dragonite". It was spotted twice in the previous episode "Hello Pummelo" as Ash, Tracy and Misty saw it flying over the sea around Pummelo Island and they learned that it was owned by the "Orange Crew" leader, Drake. It also defeated Team Rocket as they tried to steal Dragonite. In Ash`s six on six battle with Drake, it defeated Ash`s Charizard with Dragon Rage, Squirtle with Thunder and Tauros with Thunder before Ash`s Pikachu took it out with a Thunder of its own. While none of Ash`s Pokémon were strong enough to defeat Dragonite on their own, their combined attacks steadily weakened it to the point of exhaustion, allowing Pikachu to finally defeat it. Drake keeps Dragonite`s Poké Ball on a necklace. Professor Oak also owns a Dragonite and was used prior to the episode "The Mastermind of Mirage Pokémon". It also appeared in Pokémon: The First Movie, when it was sent by Mewtwo to give Ash and his friends an invitation. It also appeared in the beginning of Ash`s journey when he encountered Bill. Here, Dragonite was described as an unknown legendary Pokémon by the Pokédex, and because it was nighttime the colour of its skin couldn`t be seen.</description>

<description>Steelix is a large serpentine Pokémon that has a steel body with several spikes and a large jaw. The male has two spikes on each side of its jaw while the female only has one spike on each side. It is said that an Onix evolves into Steelix when one lives to be 100 or more, then the pressures exercised on its stone body become so high that it is compressed into a composition harder than diamond. Steelix continues to burrow underground like it did as an Onix, but it reaches far greater depths, reaching records of up to 0.6 miles (900 metres) while heading for the Earth`s core.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Lugia is a legendary Pokémon that first appears in Pokémon Gold and Silver, appearing on the boxart for Silver. Lugia, thought to be the guardian of the sea, resides deep in the ocean floor. It spends most of its time at the bottom of the sea due to its tremendous power, which includes being able to topple houses just by flapping its large, powerful wings and the ability to start storms that can last for over forty days. It is usually seen near the beginning of storms, and it often uses its wings to calm them.
It plays the role of a general legendary Pokémon in some games, where it waits in a far-off location, ready to battle. Lugia is one of the main characters of Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness. The storyline of the game depicts a "Shadow" Lugia terrorizing the locals and wreaking havoc. It is the only Shadow Pokémon whose physical appearance is different from its regular state. Shadow Lugia is said to be struggling, asking for help to free it from doing Cipher`s work in which "its deeper closed heart refuses to do". The player has to catch and Purify it for it to return to its original state.
In Pokémon: The Movie 2000, Lugia comes from the sea when the three Legendary Birds Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres are roused by a Pokémon collector who tries to catch the trio. Lugia then battles the raging Birds and, with the help of Ash and Team Rocket, manages to calm them and restore peace to nature. Lugia makes a second appearance in the Pokémon TV series when the protagonist, Ash, travels to the Whirl Islands where he meets his friend Richie to help stop a Team Rocket scientist from separating a young Lugia named "Silver" from her parent.</description>

<name>Latias</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Latias is the female Eon Pokémon from the Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald series of games and is one of a duo of Psychic/Dragon-type Pokémon, the other being Latios. These two are the only legendary Pokémon in the games that have genders (other than Heatran and Cresselia, which first appear in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.)
Latias is a red-and-white dragon Pokémon with small arms and feet, and spiky wings on her back. She has triangle-shaped blue markings on her belly that are similar to those of a Togepi. She is able to use a form of active camouflage by enfolding her body with her glass-like coat of down and refracting light in unique ways, allowing her to become invisible or even take on the appearance of a human.
Latias is highly sensitive to the emotions of people and can telepathically communicate with them. She rarely makes contact with people or other Pokémon. If Latias senses any hostility, she ruffles the feathers all over her body and cries shrilly to intimidate her foe. Like Latios, Latias is highly intelligent. Latias has been occasionally sighted in small herds of several members, although she is unable to breed in the video games.
Latias`s only anime appearance was in the fifth Pokémon anime film, Pokémon Heroes. Latias also appears in the non-Pokémon-exclusive video game Super Smash Bros. Brawl appearing in tandem with Latios as Pokémon appearing from Poké Ball items.
Latias can be found in Pokémon Sapphire after completing the Pokémon League. She is found on a random-encounter basis, similar to that of Raikou, Entei, and Suicune in Gold, Silver, and Crystal. She can also be found in Emerald after completing the Pokémon League, but in Emerald, the player`s mother tells him or her to watch a TV news story, which explains that a Pokémon (its name cannot be heard) has been seen. This gives the player a choice of capturing either Latias or Latios. Latias can also be obtained via the Eon Ticket, given to the player after attending a Nintendo promotional event for Pokémon Ruby.</description>

<description>Latios is the male Eon Pokémon. They are a blue and white, dragon-like, legendary Pokémon with small arms and feet, and spiky fighter aircraft-like wings on their back. They appear to have white flesh underneath their blue carapace. They appear extremely similar to Latias, only blue, and more angular. It is said that by folding their arms close to their body, they can fly faster than a jet. Latios are all male.
Latios` intelligence allows them to understand human languages. They have a docile temperament and dislike fighting. A Latios will only open his heart to a trainer with a compassionate spirit. Their signature attack, Luster Purge, may reduce the target`s special defense. Like Latias, Latios can also render themselves invisible.
Latios, along with Latias, have a starring role in the movie Pokémon Heroes as guardians of Altomare, a city modeled after Venice, Italy. At the end of the film, Latios sacrifices himself to protect Altomare from a tremendous tsunami. It is notable that Latios marks the first actual Pokémon death in the anime series so far (the imaginary Entei and Celebi do not count). This may have been the fact that Latios is based on Jesus in characteristics.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kyogre is one of a trio of legendary Pokémon, alongside Groudon and Rayquaza. Kyogre represents Pokémon Sapphire and appears on the cover art for the game. Kyogre represents the primal force of the oceans; as such, it has the power to bring forth storms, constant rain and massive floods. It is part of the creation myth of the Pokémon world. According to legend, a titanic battle between it and Groudon created the oceans and the land, and the two were sealed beneath their respective elements. Despite being the creator of the oceans, Kyogre still came and helped Manaphy when it needed help as any other regular Pokémon would. Kyogre is similar to an orca or killer whale. It is a Water-type with the ability Drizzle, which makes the weather rainy until another weather move is used or a Pokémon with another weather altering ability is switched in.
In Pokémon Sapphire, Team Aqua tries to awaken and control Kyogre. It is awakened by a blue orb that the group actively seeks. They eventually awaken Kyogre, but they are stopped by the player in the video games. Kyogre made its first movie appearance in the ninth Pokémon movie, Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea. In the movie, Kyogre helps Ash, May, Pikachu, and Manaphy to protect the Sea Temple and defeat The Phantom.</description>

<description>Groudon is one of a trio of legendary Pokémon, alongside Kyogre and Rayquaza, that represents Pokémon Ruby and appears on its cover art. In the legend surrounding the three, Groudon represents the land, while Kyogre and Rayquaza represent the sea and the sky, respectively. Groudon, representing land, raised lands and expanded continents in legend. Coming as a savior for humans suffering from floods caused by Kyogre, it can dissipate clouds, and evaporate water with light and heat. After a titanic battle with Kyogre, it went to sleep in underground magma, causing volcanoes to erupt when it awakes. It is a Ground-type with the Drought ability, which makes the weather sunny until another weather move is used or a Pokémon with another weather-altering ability is switched in.
Groudon first appears in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire and Pokémon Emerald along with Kyogre and Rayquaza. Pokémon Ruby focuses on Team Magma awakening Groudon to take over the world, while Pokémon Emerald has both Groudon and Kyogre awake. The anime follows a similar structure, where both Pokémon are awakened, and forced to battle by Team Magma and Team Aqua. This is foiled by Ash Ketchum and Lance, and Groudon and Kyogre return to their respective elements after calling a truce. Groudon also plays a pseudo-role in the sixth Pokémon movie, Jirachi Wishmaker, where an evil being in the form of a Groudon is formed from the energy of Jirachi.</description>

<description>Rayquaza is one of a trio of legendary Pokémon, alongside Kyogre and Groudon, that represents Pokémon Emerald and appears on its cover art. In the legend surrounding the three, Rayquaza represents the sky, while Kyogre and Groudon represent the sea and the land, respectively. Rayquaza resides within the ozone layer of the Earth and has lived there for hundreds of millions of years without ever descending. To those who have observed Rayquaza from the surface of the planet, Rayquaza has always appeared to be a zooming meteor. Rayquaza feeds on water and particles in the Earth`s atmosphere. It is said to only descend from the ozone layer if Kyogre and Groudon were to fight, in order to end the feud and maintain the balance of nature.
In Pokémon Emerald, Rayquaza is seen in a series of cutscenes. Once the player progresses past the Magma and Aqua Hideouts, Kyogre and Groudon wake up and start fighting, with the Red and Blue Orbs unable to control them. It is eventually sought out at the Sky Pillar, and eventually forces the two to cease their battle. Rayquaza appears as a boss character in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games, where the main team has to fight it in order to have it annihilate a falling star hurtling towards the planet.
Rayquaza is featured in the seventh Pokémon movie, Destiny Deoxys. Four years prior to the main events of the movie, Rayquaza is nearly injured in the ozone layer by the passage of a meteor containing the essence of Deoxys. Rayquaza seemingly destroys the Deoxys afterwards, but it is eventually revived. Rayquaza goes after it again, but after being rescued by it, Rayquaza decides that it isn`t an enemy, and returns to the atmosphere.</description>

Unlike the aquatic animal the Hippopotamus, which is what`s it`s loosely based on, Hippopotas lives in deserts, and hates getting wet; however, it is one of the few non-water ground type Pokémon that can learn Water Pulse.</description>

<description>Hippowdon is the evolved form of Hippopotas. Sand appears to be coming out of the holes on its back. Its mouth can span seven feet. It is also mentioned, in a bookcase in Harbor Inn in Canalave City, that this Pokémon created the deserts of the world, but the spirit of the desert is Flygon, and the heat was created by Camerupt. Males are colored yellow, while females are colored black. It is interesting to note that males are yellow, so that in their desert environments, they have trouble finding each other to fight. The female is colored black for the opposite reason, so she is easy to find. In the 4th gen game series for Nintendo DS, Hippowdon has the special ability called "Sand Stream", which whips up a sandstorm whenever it is introduced into battle. The sandstorm will continue until another weather condition is set, or if for example Rayquaza is switched in (because Rayquaza has an ability to negate weather effects).</description>

<description>Dialga, known as the Temporal Pokémon, is described as an ancient deity of the Sinnoh region with the ability to control time.

It is stopped by Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf, which nullifiy its power, and can be captured or defeated by the player.
Palkia has a roar that sounds extremely similar to the varactyl, a large reptilian creature from Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. In the movie Pokémon: The Rise of Darkrai, it has another roar which is the exact copy of King Ghidorah from the Godzilla franchise.</description>

<description>Regigigas, known as the Colossal Pokémon, is one of the legendary Pokémon that premieres in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl; the name meaning king of the giants. It is similar to the three Regis - Regirock, Regice, and Registeel - in both name, body structure and the fact that all Regis are weak to Fighting-type attacks. It will only appear in the game if the three Regis, after being transferred via Pal Park, are in your party while examining Regigigas` body. Regigigas was sealed in the Snowpoint Temple for thousands of years, so long that moss have grown over its body, and modern humans thought it was just a statue of the Pokémon. A Sinnoh legend has it in the past Regigigas towed continents using ropes. The legend says that it had unbelievable strength, but seemingly since it has not used it in ages, it has trouble getting its act together at the beginning of a battle, evidenced by its ability, Slow Start. In Platinum, Regigigas` level is reduced to 1, making it the lowest level non-glitch wild &amp; legendary Pokémon, more evidence of the fact that it has not used its powers for millennia.</description>

<name>Arceus</name>
<gender>none/does not apply</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Arceus, known as the Alpha Pokémon or "The Original One", is the ultimate legendary Pokémon. Arceus premiered with the fourth generation but did not appear (without cheats) in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. It has a silver-coloured body and has a large, golden wheel around its abdomen, connected by spikes filled with gems. It is said in a book called "The Original Story" that Arceus was born from an egg in a vortex of pure chaos. After it was born, it created two beings from itself: one of time, one of space Palkia, and then three more beings, named Dialga, Palkia, Azelf, Uxie, and Mesprit respectively. The two former created matter and the latter three created spirit, while Arceus entered an eternal sleep. This story can be found in the Canalave Library, and can also be told from the various elemental plates the player encounters in the story. This story appears to contradict that of Mew being the ancestor of all Pokémon.
Arceus has the Multitype Ability, which allows the player to change Arceus` type from Normal to any of the other sixteen types by having it hold various elemental plates found throughout the game. Arceus` signature move, Judgment (Learned at level 100), uses the same typing as the held elemental plate. Arceus also has the highest base stat total of any Pokémon to date, which makes it the strongest Pokémon of all time excluding Primal forms and Mega Evolutions. (Its Base Stat Total is 720, with each stat having a value of 120. There are many that beat Arceus in each category individually, but its BST is unmatched among standard form Pokemon.) Due to its power and rarity, it is known by many fans as the "God of Pokemon".
Officially, Nintendo has not released further details on Arceus in Japan or the United States. The only way for players to currently capture Arceus is through cheats or glitches such as using a Gameshark or an Action Replay DS and by using the event item, The Azure Flute which has only been distributed in Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum versions. Arceus has also been distributed in various events in around the world.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Giratina, known as the Renegade Pokémon, is one of the legendary Pokémon that premiered in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. Giratina represents the Dimensions (or perhaps inter-dimensional travel, because space and time, which lie under the control of Palkia and Dialga respectively, are dimensions in themselves). Giratina is described in the Pokémon video games as a creature that lives in a world on the reverse side of the human world. This area is in a cemetery-like ruin in the depths of Turnback Cave, a place where the dimensional boundaries are said to be distorted, and dead Pokémon are able to enter the physical world. Giratina has a long, platinum-colored, segmented body with six legs, and has ghostly wings with spikes. Giratina is featured prominently in the upcoming film `Giratina and the Sky`s Warrior` (Giratina to Sora no Hanataba: Sheimi) and in the game Pokémon Platinum where it has a new form called "Origin Forme" (オリジンフォルム), which is similar to its regular form except it has a slightly different face, wing shape, and spikes in place of legs, becoming more serpentine.
Giratina is infamous as an extremely durable wall, with astronomical defensive statistics. Its Origin Forme trades its defenses for improved offenses, but it is limited to the Platinum Orb as a hold item.
Giratina`s Another Forme looks like a basilisk, it has a beak-like mouth, it has a crown on the head, it has red eyes, it has big spikey wings, it has six legs, a serpent tail, and a bird-like cry.</description>

<description>Jessie is one half of of the Team Rocket duo that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokemon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
Jessie`s mother, Miyamoto, was a high-ranking Team Rocket agent. When Jessie was around the age of three, Miyamoto left on a mission to the Andes Mountains to record the voice of the elusive Pokemon Mew. However, Miyamoto disappeared, and Jessie was put into a foster home which had very little money. There were times when she had no choice but to eat snow because of a lack of more nourishing food.
When she was old enough, she left home to become a Pokemon nurse in Jouto. However, the school she was enrolled in was literally for Pokemon nurses (i.e. Chansey), so she failed to graduate and left, leaving behind a Chansey she had befriended there. It is assumed that she then traveled back to Kanto, where she enrolled in Pokemon Tech, a trainer`s school, met James, and subsequently failed and dropped out. After this, Jessie and James joined a bicycle gang in Sunny Town, where Jessie was known for swinging a chain above her head as she rode her bike (nicknamed "Chainer Jess").
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between Jessie and James after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Sometime before joining Team Rocket, and it is not known when, Jessie obtained a Contest Pass in the Hoenn region. Also during the years before Team Rocket, she had several boyfriends, all of whom left her and/or treated her badly. In "Xatu the Future", she revealed that she had once worked at a T.V. station as the Weathergirl. In "From Cradle to Save" is also revealed that she once was a ninja.
She has a long-standing bitter rivalry with Cassidy, another member of Team Rocket. Another member, Wendy, held a grudge against Jessie for failing to pay for a drink (making Wendy pay), but got her revenge when she added the charge to Jessie`s overall Team Rocket bill.
In the episode "Ignorance is Blissey", Jessie was reunited with her friend Chansey from the Pokemon nurse school; Chansey had since evolved into a Blissey.
Starting in Hoenn, Jessie has become a Pokemon Coordinator, entering every contest that she could. She frequently makes it to the battle round, but usually loses there. However, in "Borrowing on Bad Faith", she finally succeeded in winning an (unofficial) contest by using Ash`s Aipom, which she had saved earlier in the episode. And, in "Team Shocker!", she finally wins an official contest with her Dustox in at Solaceon City. Later she also won a ribbon with help of her Yanmega. She has Contest Passes to compete in the Hoenn, Kanto, and Sinnoh regions.
While Jessie`s role in the Pokemon anime has not yet ended, in Toshihiro Ono`s manga, "The Electric Tale of Pikachu", she ended up married to James and with child.
Jessie seems to have a special preference for snake-like Pokemon, owning both an Arbok and a Seviper. In "The Ninja Poke Showdown", she expressed a preference for Poison-type Pokemon in general.
For unknown reasons, she, James and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation.
In the Kanto contests, Jessie disguises herself as Jessebella (which is similar to James former fiancee Jessiebelle) wearing a red dress and glasses. Eventually, Ash, Brock, Max and May finds out her true identity at the last contest.
During the Kanto Grand Festival, Jessie dresses up as Jessadia (Japanese: キャンディ・ムサリーナ Candy Musalina). and wears glasses, long white socks, a yellow and orange dress, and has her hair in pigtails. She works there as an announcer and Lilian Meridian`s assistant; Lilian herself says she may not really like "Jessadia"`s style, but recognizes her talent. In the Latin American dub, she enters Super Contests under the name Jessiebella (referencing Jessiebelle again). Jessie currently still continues to use the Jessalina disguise while participating in Super Contests.
In "Pruning a Passel of Pals!" and "Strategy With a Smile!" she once again used her Jessadia disguise to report on the Wallace Cup.
Although Jessie had entered mostly every contest in Hoenn &amp; Kanto, she lost in every single one, whether it was the first match of the Battle Rounds or the finals. But in the Sinnoh Region, she has so far won 2 ribbons using her Dustox and Yanmega.</description>

<description>Meowth is a very unique Pokémon as it has many of the characteristics of a human. It walks on two feet, talks and is as smart as any human. Meowth is currently a member of Team Rocket and he travels around with Jessie and James trying to capture Pikachu and other rare Pokémon for Giovanni.
Meowth generally finishes his sentences with "Nyaa (ニャー)" which is the equivalent of "meow" in English. This helps people remember that despite his ability to talk like a human, he still has cat character traits.
Meowth is also known for coming up with his many schemes to try to capture Pikachu. While Jessie and James always agree with Meowth and think his plans are brilliant, they are generally foiled by Ash and his friends.
Long Con to Access Raimon City Pokémon Center
Meowth schemed with Jessie, James and Doctor Zager to figure out a way for them to infiltrate the Raimon City Pokémon Center where high-leveled Pokémon are stored in a vault that is protected by a security machine scan system that would only open if Nurse Joy (Isshu) or Nurse Joy`s Audino were scanned. Meowth pretended to be no longer part of Team Rocket making up a story that his made an error while executing a certain operation and when headquarters hear of his mistake, they told him he was fired.
Ash, Iris and Cilan believed him and allowed Meowth to travel with him. Pikachu though didn`t trust Meowth even though Meowth proved on numerous occasion that it should be trusted. Meowth`s plan was put into action when they arrived at the Raimon City Pokémon Center and as soon as Nurse Joy`s Audino was scanned to open the door, Meowth turned on Pikachu and the other and captured all the Pokémon in the vault. The long con had been a success and Meowth met up with Jessie and James below the Pokémon Center. Unfortunately, they weren`t able to get away as Ash and his friends realized that Meowth had just been conning them and they were able to stop Team Rocket.</description>

<description>James is one part of of the Team Rocket trio that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokémon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
James is mostly a comedic parody of bishounen characters; the English dub in particular tends to give him a melodramatic and even campy tone. He is somewhat famous for carrying a rose, though in more recent episodes he does not display it often. Mostly, his rose is displayed in the Team Rocket motto.
The only child of millionaires, James was forced to endure formal society. At a young age, he was forcefully engaged to a girl of whom he was terrified, Jessiebelle, all because his parents wanted to have a wealthy daughter-in-law. Thus, he ran away from home, leaving behind his beloved pet Growlie. He attempted to enroll in Pokémon Tech, a trainer`s school, but, along with his new friend Jessie, flunked out. Then, with Jessie, he joined the Sunny Town bicycle gang, where he was popular for being the only gang member to have to use training wheels (nicknamed "Trainer Jim"). Eventually James, Jessie, and the bike gang went their separate ways.
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between James and Jessie after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Since he is proficient in several activities, including Pokémon haiku and PokéRinger, it is possible that he developed his skills during his temporary separation from Jessie, but this is not known for sure.
In the episode "Holy Matrimony!", James returned to his home as a result of a trap by his parents, who pretended to be dead. He was reunited with his old pet Growlie and managed to avoid marrying Jessiebelle. Growlie stayed behind when James returned to Jessie and Meowth.
James has a tendency to be swindled by a Magikarp Salesman, who has on many occasions tricked him into buying a Magikarp or other useless Pokémon and items for large sums of money.
James also has a tendency to cross-dress, but has not done it since "Pros and Con Artists". He does, however, dress up like famous celebrities as well, such as Professor Oak, Juan, and Norman.
James loves rare bottle caps and has an impressive collection of them. In the episode "All That Glitters!" it is revealed that he has "drunk enough soda pop to float an aircraft carrier".
For unknown reasons, he, Jessie and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation. However in newer episodes the balloon is shown with `jets` attached to explain how they get from one place to another faster than walking.</description>

<description>The Beginning
Ash is the main character of the Pokémon anime. Raised in Pallet Town, he started his journey to become a Pokémon Master at the age of 10. On the day that he started his journey, Ash carelessly woke up late despite being told by his mother, Delia Ketchum to get to bed. He rushed to Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory only to find out that the beginner Pokémon - Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander - had already been given out to trainers who arrived on time. However, Professor Samual Oak mentioned that there was one more Pokémon available - Pikachu. Despite constantly hitting Ash with Electric-type attacks and refusing to return to its PokéBall, Ash decided to take Pikachu along with him on his journey to become a Pokémon Master. Pikachu is cold towards Ash at first and laughs at his failures; however, when Ash saves Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow, he begins to warm up to his new trainer and the two finally become friends. After the battle with the flock of Spearow, a Ho-Oh is seen flying towards a rainbow in the sky. The PokéDex reveals that the Ho-Oh is an unidentified Pokémon. Thus, the journey of Ash and Pikachu begins.
Captures in Viridian Forest
While making his way towards Pewter City and his first Kanto League Gym Battle, Ash came upon a wild Caterpie deep within Viridian Forest. Instead of using Pikachu to battle against the wild Pokémon, Ash took his chances and threw a PokéBall without weakining the Caterpie first. Luckily, he was able to catch the Pokémon without any trouble. The capture of Ash`s Caterpie marked Ash`s first capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Caterpie the second Pokémon to join his team.
The next day, while continuing the trek through the Viridian Forest, Ash came up on a wild Pidgeotto. He tried to just throw a PokéBall like he did with Ash`s Caterpie, but Pidgeotto swatted the PokéBall away. Misty informed that he must weaken the Pokémon first before attempting to capture it. He called out Ash`s Caterpie to battle against, but Misty quickly informed him that Bug-type Pokémon are weak against Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeotto. After Pidgeotto dealt significant damage to Ash`s Caterpie, Ash recalled it and sent out Pikachu. Pikachu was able to use its Thundershock to weaken Pidgeotto and allow Ash to capture it with a PokéBall. Thus, this capture marked Ash`s second capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Pidgeotto the third Pokémon to join his team.
Later on, while still in the Viridian Forest, Ash was approached by Team Rocket, who attempted to steal his Pokémon. After defeating Meowth, James`s Koffing, and Jessie`s Ekans, Ash`s Caterpie evolved into Ash`s Metapod.
Some of Ash`s greatest accomplishments have been at the various Pokémon Leagues. He was the victor at the Orange League and the Battle Frontier. He also competed in the Indigo League and the Johto Silver Conference where he placed admirably in both those competitions as well.
Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup
Ash participated in the Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup at the Kagome Town stadium. In the first round he was in the fifth match and faced off against Marris. The match was quickly showcased and Ash won the battle and advanced to the second round while Marris was eliminated from the tournament.
The Isshu League
Ash participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where he was matched up against Trip. Trip`s Serperior was sent out to battle Pikachu and Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior`s speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter Trip`s Serperior speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round. The two met in the Pokémon Center after the battle, and Trip vowed that the next time they met that he would win. The two shook hands and parted ways.
In the first main round, Ash`s opponent was shown on the match up electronic board but not much else is known about the battle. Ash`s Scraggy participated in the second main round of the Isshu League tournament where it faced off against a Darumakka. It was able to defeat it so that moved on to the next round.
In the third round, Stephan was matched up against Ash. Cilan noted that the two of them have a very direct taste and that it would be a good battle. It was only a 3 on 3 battle but the both of them gave it their all. The first two battles of the third round setup the final match up of Stephan`s Sawk vs Ash`s Krookodile, both of which were very injured from the previous battles. Both of them did their best to muster up their reserve strength but in the end a surprise move of Aerial Ace by Ash`s Krookodile was super effective against Stephan`s Sawk and it knocked it out to give Ash the victory while eliminating Stephan from the tournament. Stephan realized after the battle that the reason that Ash withdrew Waruvial after the first battle was because Ash knew that Stephan would definitely send out Dageki, so he didn`t reveal that it knew Aerial Ace and saved until the end.</description>

<description>The Beginning
On the morning that Ash was to start his Pokémon journey, he woke up late and by the time he reached Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory, all of the beginner Pokémon were already taken. However, Professor Samual Oak did have one Pokémon left, a wild Pikachu. At first, Pikachu did not like Ash and would refuse to enter his PokéBall. He would often laugh at Ash`s failures and refused to listen to him. However, after Ash proved his loyalty to Pikachu by protecting him from a flock of Spearow, and thus began to earn Pikachu`s trust and respect. The two have since become best friends and Pikachu never leaves Ash`s side.
Since the day Team Rocket first encountered Pikachu, it has been their sole goal to capture it. Day after day, their plan to capture Pikachu has been thwarted mainly due to Pikachu`s amazingly powerful Thunderbolt that keeps on blasting them off.
On numerous occasions, Pikachu has made it evident that he is happy being a Pikachu and has no desire to evolve into a more powerful Raichu. It has proven time and time again that it is a powerful and worthy opponent to any Pokémon that dares to battle it.
Gym Battle against Burgh`s Leavanny
Pikachu was then sent out to battle Burgh`s Leavanny. Burgh`s Leavanny managed to tie up Pikachu with String Shot but unlike Ash`s Swadloon who was able to break free, Pikachu ended up getting hit with a couple of Leaf Storm attacks and a Hyper Beam before it rolled into another of Burgh`s Leavanny`s Leaf Storm attacks to break the string off its body so it could attack. Freed from the String Shot, Burgh`s Leavanny tried to tie it up again but Pikachu managed to avoid it with its speed and then knocked Burgh`s Leavanny out with a combination of Iron Tail and Electro Ball.
Gym Battle against Elesa
Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy and was then matched up with Pikachu. Pikachu made quick work of Elesa`s Emolga and knocked it out with one attack, its Iron Tail.
Elesa`s Tynamo was the last Pokémon that she used in her gym battle against Ash. It was matched up against Pikachu who had just defeated her Emonga. Pikachu had a hard time defending against the fast Tackle attack that Elesa`s Tynamo kept hitting it with but Pikachu used its Thunderbolt to create a large dust cloud leaving only a small corridor for Pikachu to focus on it and so Elesa`s Tynamo couldn`t maneuver out of the way. Pikachu one hit K.O`d Elesa`s Tynamo with a Iron Tail. The loss gave Ash the overall victory.
Battle against Alder`s Bouffalant
Ash challenged Alder to a battle and he accepted though he had been walking all night and was actually quite tired. Alder sent out his Buffron to battle Pikachu but just as the battle started, Alder fell asleep standing up and didn`t give any orders to his Buffron. Alder`s Bouffalant stood still as Pikachu began hitting it with attack after attack until it Alder`s Bouffalant finally got mad at Alder and charged at him and set him flying into a tree. After that, Alder`s Bouffalant no longer wished to battle and Alder conceded the battle.
Gym Battle against Skyla
In Skyla air battle simulation, Ash`s Tranquill was matched up against Skyla`s Unfezant and since her Pokémon was the highest evolved form, she determined that her Pokémon would be the winner in that match-up. In the actual gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was up against Skyla`s Unfezant which was the match-up just after Ash`s Tranquill had defeated Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla`s Unfezant proved to be stronger and faster than Ash`s Tranquill, so Ash recalled it and set out Pikachu. Pikachu had a definite advantage over Skyla`s Unfezant with its electric attacks and it quickly knocked it out with its Electro Ball attack.
Ash Just after Pikachu ended up knocking out Skyla`s Unfezant, Skyla`s Swanna was sent out to battle against it. Skyla had been watching her grandpa`s battle videos and noticed that he used the move Aqua Ring to defend against Electric attacks. She used that same defense against Pikachu which nullified its Electric attacks. It`s Iron Tail also couldn`t hit it so high in the air. Ash then noticed the rings in the air and Pikachu jumped up on them and managed to hit Skyla`s Swanna but not directly. Pikachu was now up in the air though and Skyla`s Swanna had the advantage there and it quickly knocked Pikachu out with a powerful Brave Bird attack.
Battle Against Trip`s Serperior at the Isshu League
Pikachu participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where it is was matched up against Trip`s Serperior. Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter its speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round.</description>

<description>While Wobbuffet is technically Jessie`s Pokémon, it has been around so long that it has become a main character, appearing in almost every episode of the series since it debut.
Wobbuffet was first seen walking around with Benny, his previous trainer. Jessie traded her Lickitung for Wobbuffet and it has been with her ever since that day.
Wobbuffet rarely battles but when he does, his Counter and Mirror Coat moves have proved to be very effective. Unfortunately, Jessie`s tactics aren`t always sufficient to master Wobbuffet`s superior defensive skills.
Wobbuffet also randomly comes out of his Pokeball, especially during the Team Rocket motto. He is also seen blasting off with Jessie regardless if he was actually part of the action.</description>

<description>Kyurem is known as the Boundary Pokémon. It resembles a large bipedal gray dragon with various icy appendages. Kyurem has small arms, wings with two large claws (with the right wing noticeably shorter than the left), a long tail that ends in a fork, a head covered by ice with yellow eyes, and a very long, slender neck.
Kyurem is the strongest Dragon type Pokémon in the world. It was born at the same time as Zekrom and Reshiram.
It possesses the strongest genes and its body is constantly emitting a bitter chill. Kyurem lives in an abandoned mine up over the mountains near Roshan. It`s said to have never been seen leaving there until it chased after Keldeo. Kyurem is able to speak to humans.
Keldeo went to challenge Kyurem on its own despite not being able to use its sword yet and against the council of the Sacred Swordsman. During the battle against , Keldeo learned that it was still too weak to face Kyurem and it got its horn broken off and it fled because it was scared. Virizion, Terrakion and Cobalion came to rescue Keldeo but they were frozen in ice by Kyurem.
After falling on the train that Ash and his friends were traveling on, it befriended them and with their encouragement, Keldeo decided to face Kyurem once more. During that battle, Keldeo learned to use its sword properly and was able to prove to Kyurem that it was a strong Pokémon after all. Kyurem complemented Keldeo on a nice sword and putting the safety of its friends first before accepting that it won the battle against Keldeo. After Keldeo proved to be worthy to become a Sacred Swordsman, Virizion, Terrakion and Cobalion had no objections and agreed that Keldeo should join them.
A legend behind the Pokémon states that it came to Earth on an icy meteor from space. At night, it came to Lacunosa Town to terrorize and to eat its inhabitants, causing the residents of the town to lock their doors at night and never exit their house unless the sun is up. Another legend states that it is solely the living corpse of the ancient dragon that both Reshiram and Zekrom split from after its original owners had a conflict with each other on how to rule the Unova region.[49] In a poll conducted by IGN, it was voted as the 77th best Pokémon, where the staff commented on how its typing and stats make it "a formidable Pokémon".
Alternate forms of Kyurem were announced with the revealing of the new Pokémon Black Version 2 and White Version 2 games. On Junichi Masuda`s Twitter page they were formally called Black Kyurem and White Kyurem. Kyurem can change into these forms by using a special item to merge with either Reshiram or Zekrom.</description>

<description>Clemont`s Dedenne appeared in a forest outside of Lumiose City. As soon as Bonnie saw it she thought it was cute and wanted to keep it but because she wasn`t a Pokémon Trainer, she tried to convince her brother to capture it for her. Bonnie noted that it wasn`t afraid of humans and it got along with Pikachu quickly since they`re both Electric types and they communicated with electricity.
Clemont initial attempt to capture it was not successful though. A few days later though, the same Dedenne reappeared as it had been following them the whole time they had been traveling. This time though Clemont was successful in capturing it. It really seems to like the Pokémon food that Clemont and Bonnie give it.</description>

<description>Clemont`s Chespin was initially one of the three Pokémon a Trainer receives from Professor Sycamore when they start out on their journey.

Team Rocket captured Professor Sycamore, Serena and Bonnie but Harimaron was able to follow a macaron crumb trail to their hideout. It was initially more concerned about getting the macarons back but it finally realized that Team Rocket was also a threat, so it helped out and manged to stop the Mega Mega Nyarth mecha.
During its time with Clemont in the crisis situation, the two began to bond and just as Clemont was leaving Professor Sycamore lab, it indicated that it wanted to travel with Clemont. Professor Sycamore gave Clemont Harimaron`s monster ball and he got it.</description>

<description>While it is not known to evolve to or from any other Pokémon, it has an alternate form, which it changes into by using the Prison Bottle. Its default form, Hoopa Confined, will then become Hoopa Unbound. Hoopa Unbound will revert into Hoopa Confined if three days have passed after using the Prison Bottle or if it is deposited in the PC.
Hoopa Confined was officially revealed in the February 2015 issue of CoroCoro magazine. Hoopa Unbound was officially revealed in the May 2015 issue of CoroCoro magazine.
Hoopa Confined is a light purple Pokémon with several pink markings. There is a v-shaped marking on its chest and bands around its wrists. Additionally, there are pink markings around its head and a growth on top resembling hair tied into a ponytail. There is a yellow, ring marking in the center of its forehead, and it has green eyes with yellow sclera. On either side of its head is a dark gray horn that curves slightly upward. Hoopa has three gold rings: one large one around its lower body and one hanging freely on each of its horns. Its arms are not attached to its body and float next to it. Each arm has a small golden spike on one end and a hand similar to a mitten on the other. There is a golden spike on each shoulder, which is similar to those on its arms. Hoopa`s lower body consists only of a wispy structure similar to its ponytail.
Hoopa Unbound has a similar color scheme to Hoopa Confined, although the main color is now a light blue and its markings are slightly darker. This form is bipedal and has six arms. The ponytail on its head is larger and bushier, and its eyes are now yellow with white sclera. Its horns are darker and less curved with spiky, purple fur at the base. This form has a pointed, dark gray snout and a mouth full of pointed teeth. Several tufts of purple fur surround its torso. Each of its arms is disconnected from the body and has a gold ring on one end and a three-fingered hand on the other. All of its arms has a ring around each wrist as well. Many other rings are present on this form: there are two around each ankle, two around the base of its ponytail, two at the base of each horn, one near the center of each horn, one around its waist, and one encircles a black hole in the middle of its body. The circular mark on its forehead also surrounds a much smaller black hole. A purple, protruding stripe extends down each leg, widens at the knee, and makes a circle around the tip of the foot. Additionally, this form has a tail with a purple stripe along the top and arrow-shaped tip.
Hoopa has the power to transport things using teleportation, which warps space. Hoopa Unbound is said to be Hoopa`s true form. Hoopa Unbound is said to have the power to bend dimensions which allows it to seize anything in the world. As seen in the anime, Hoopa Unbound has the ability to control and summon powerful Legendary Pokémon. Hoopa Confined is the only known Pokémon that can learn Hyperspace Hole. Hoopa`s alternate form, Hoopa Unbound, has its own signature move, Hyperspace Fury.</description>
