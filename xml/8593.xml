<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="296685">Well. Not much to say about this really except it`s a conclusion.

So yeah if you`ve watched the others you might as well finish it off.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="284224">This season was fine but in my opinion it laced a little bit of main evil till the end. If you liked the last 3 seasons you will like this, but there was too much romance and not so much action.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="480721">For fans of the Zero no Tsukaima series, this one provides absolution and finality.  Pull up a chair, make some popcorn, and relax as one of the better fantasy animes takes its leave.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="526839">what a finale! A MUST for those who have seen the last 3 seasons. I`m quite surprised at the low rating this season has. It isn`t as good as the second season, but still is an improvement compared to the 3rd. Again, it has the same style of comedy, little amount of character development, and really has all the action crammed in the last few episodes.  I do have to say that it was an abrupt ending, and what I really thought was a waste of plot, if they wanted to they could have easily put 3-5 more quality episodes towards the end. What a pity. Still, Zero no Tsukaima on the overall is a great series to watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="371579">Too much fan service and less action. Ending was OK for me. 
But somehow it felt empty, nothing interesting. Previous seasons were much entertaining.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="486670">I was expecting more from the Final season!
I mean new cool character appear and it could show a lot of things!
little action and ultra too much romance :) !
very nice finalle!
must see if you have watched the previous seasons!</recommendation>

<name>horny nosebleed</name>
<description>In Japanese media, healthy young men who have no other sexual outlet will often suffer nosebleeds upon seeing the naked female body, or even just a pair of well-filled panties.
The nosebleed is, of course, a visual shorthand/euphemism for sexual arousal. It is commonly interpreted that way for males and females, with little trickles of blood indicating mild arousal, and gushing fountains of blood indicating erection/extreme arousal in both sexes. It can also be interpreted as shorthand strictly for erections in males. In that case, when blood shoots from the nose explosively, and in ridiculous quantity, the implication would be an ejaculation.

<name>elf</name>
<description>The origin of Elves (Norse; álfar(elves), álfr(elf)) can be found in ancient Norse mythology, in which, elves are described as divine, or near-divine, race of humanoids (Vættir), likened to the Æsir. In common description they are described as sage and immortal beings occupying the threshold between humans and the gods. In some cases humans that were beloved by the gods became elves within their lives. Ancient Elves are delineated into a pair of similar but distinct races; Light Elves (Ljósálfar) and Dark Elves (Svartálfar), each originating from separate homes within the nine worlds of Yggdrasil. Within the Poetic Edda the differences are commonly ascribed as:
"There is one place there that is called the Elf Home (Álfheimr which is the elven city). People live there that are named the light elves (Ljósálfar). But the dark elves (Dökkálfar) live below in earth, in caves and the dark forest and they are unlike them in appearance - and more unlike them in reality. The Light Elves are brighter than the sun in appearance, but the Dark Elves are blacker than pitch." (Snorri, Gylfaginning 17, Prose Edda)</description>

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>large breasts</name>
<description>Large breasts are breasts a fair notch larger than average, as found in some adolescent girls or fully grown women; however, as anime has no upper limit to breast size, the definition applies somewhat differently. To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>

<name>violent retribution for accidental infringement</name>
<description>A comedy / slapstick element often found in Ecchi anime: The hilarity derives from spontaneous embarrassment, overreaction of the "victim" (girl), immediate retribution for a seemingly inappropriate act, and a sense of pity with the supposed "aggressor" (boy).
Typically a boy will - through no fault of his own - stumble into a girl, thus invading her personal space. In the process the boy may e.g. pull down her skirt, grab the girl`s breasts, or accidentally kiss her. Any level-headed girl would see the accident just for what it is. Not so the girl with an overly developed sense of modesty, and a thing for violence. She - often a tsundere - will clobber the boy with excessive brutality.</description>

<name>feudal warfare</name>
<description>Feudal Warfare is the warfare of the Middle Ages and therefore the setting must take place in a time line similar to that of Middle Ages or its Asian/American counterparts, or in a fantasy world. Generally it can be described the same way as the Military category, just that the weapons used are swords, spears, bows, catapults, cannons and other weapons used in the Middle Ages.
Note: Just because the anime contains a guy or a couple of guys with swords wondering about, doesn`t make it applicable for this category, unless there are larger military organizations/groups involved in armed conflict with each other, you might not want to add this genre.</description>

<description>A novel is a relatively long work of narrative fiction, normally written in prose form, and which is typically published as a book.

<name>parallel world</name>
<description>A parallel world, parallel universe, or alternative reality is a self-contained separate reality coexisting with our own. Because "alternative reality" sometimes implies that the reality is a variant of our own, like for example a mirror world, we use the term "parallel world/universe" which is more general, without any connotations implying a relationship (or lack thereof) with our own world/universe (meaning a fictional world can just as well have an alternative reality, it doesn`t need to be our reality). To put it more simply, this category is to show if more than 1 world/universe/reality is present in the anime.
Multiple timelines of the same world/universe/reality are NOT considered parallel worlds. For example, in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate] the cast travels through multiple "World Lines", which are defined as parallel timelines of the same universe had various events occurred with differing outcomes.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<description>Romance describes a story that deals with love between two or more characters typically also having an optimistic ending. Romance is also a difficulty encountered when creating a harem.</description>

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<name>social class issues</name>
<description>A character`s standing in society is cause of many issues. More generally, the society`s class structure is the source of many problems in the anime.
A common example is class division; a strong and rigid class division between rich/elite and poor/commoners, with the elites having disproportionately more privilege than the common class.
This can be applied not only when royalty and nobility are present, but also dystopian societies display often these divisions.
Another example is a division between employees and management, with employees akin to the common class, and management akin to the elite class.</description>

<name>melodrama</name>
<description>A melodrama is a dramatic work that exaggerates plot and characters in order to appeal to the emotions, often with strongly stereotyped characters. Language, behaviour, or events which resemble melodramas are also called melodramatic. In scholarly and historical musical contexts melodramas are dramas of the 18th and 19th centuries in which orchestral music or song was used to accompany the action.
Melodrama is a style of drama that has been applied on the stage, in movies and television, and radio formats, from the 18th century to the present. Because of the long timeframe in which the style has existed, it is difficult to derive a precise definition. The term melodrama is most often used pejoratively, to suggest that the work to which the term is applied lacks sophistication or subtlety.
The term originated from the early 19th-century French word mélodrame, which is derived from Greek melos, music, and French drame, drama (from Late Latin drāma, which in turn derives from Greek drān, to do, perform).

<name>isekai</name>
<description>An isekai story is one in which the lead characters are transferred to and become stuck or trapped in another world, one completely different from the one they lived in up until the transfer. The new world is commonly a http://anidb.net/t2628 [fictional world], such as a http://anidb.net/t2838 [parallel world] or http://anidb.net/t2839 [virtual world] (other fictional world types can also apply). What defines the isekai genre is that the characters are sent to another world, often but not always a parallel one, and they generally cannot come back permanently without meeting a highly specific goal.
In order to adapt to their new environment, they must use the abilities and knowledge brought from their former world as well as any that may have been bestowed upon them by their brave new world. In some cases, they will seek and eventually find a way to return; in others, they will gleefully embrace their new life.
http://anidb.net/a144 [Inuyasha] is an example where isekai applies to a fictional world that is not also a parallel or virtual world. http://anidb.net/ch7246 [Higurashi Kagome] climbs down an ancient well at her grandfather`s shrine and is transported to feudal Japan (time travel). While she eventually gains the physical ability to travel back and forth between her time period and feudal Japan, her bonds and responsibilities to feudal Japan tie her there until they are ultimately resolved.
For clarity, below is an illustrative example where isekai is applied to a non-fictional, non-parallel, non-virtual world.

* The main characters are from Earth. One day, they are abducted by Nazis from Mars (alternate "world") are brought back to their Martian base. The main characters are trapped on Mars. Their only escape is to defeat the Nazis and steal their spaceship to return to Earth (specific goal required to escape); they are left to thier own devices, with no prospect of help from Earth, and no way to contact Earth.

<description>Louise Françoise le Blanc de La Vallière, the heroine of the series, is a student at the Tristain Magical Academy. She earned the sobriquet Zero Louise because of her ineptness at magic, and was frequently the butt of jokes among her classmates. On the day that all students at her level were to summon their magical familiars, she performs the rite, but instead of the usual magical creatures, unexpectedly summons a Japanese teenager, http://anidb.net/ch4052 [Hiraga Saito], who, being inscribed with the runes of a familiar, reluctantly assumes that role.
[SPOILER]It turns out that her ineptitude at normal magic is because she is actually a very rare Void Mage, and normal magical training does not cover that.[/SPOILER]
She is named after Louise Françoise de la Baume le Blanc de La Vallière (1644-1710), one of the most famous Maîtresses-en-titre of Louis XIV.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Vittorio Serevare is the current Pope of Romalia, and holding the title of `St. Aegis the 32nd`, the `Shield of the Founder`, and took the throne three years prior to Saito`s summoning. His appearance is even more of a `bishounen` than Julio, and he is slightly over 20 years old.
He is kind-hearted in that he cares for orphans and trying to increase the welfare of the commoners, but has to deal with politicking with the nobles in the process. Despite his kindness, he has his ruthless streak in doing anything and everything that is necessary for Helkeginia; Vittorio, and Julio be extension, is perfectly willing to use extreme measures such as deliberately provoke Gallia to start a war, manipulating many people emotionally, and even assassination if it means they can save Helkeginia from certain destruction.
Even with his ruthless streak, Vittorio is not a heartless monster. He knows full well how atrocious his actions are, and knows eventually he will have to step on the path Founder Brimir has paved and commit genocide on the elves and shed sincere tears in sadness that such actions are necessary to save humanity in what is seen as a `kill or be killed` situation.
From his actions, it is obvious he is a master politician in manipulating others, in that even Henrietta who is known for her ferocity in such dealings was outmaneuvered by him.
The first time we see Vittorio is in episode one of season four, he presents himself in a chapel in Romalia to Louise, Saito, and Tiffania. He reveals that Tiffania is a void user, much like Louise, and himself. Astonished to learn the identities of two new void users, the three further learn that Julio is the familiar of Vittorio, and is Windalfr, the right hand of God.
Vittorio was in possession of the Founder`s round mirror until is was stolen from a treasure room, the mirror allowed the user to look into the past of the Founder Brimir and see the actions of his lifetime.

She looks like a mother or an older sister of Tabitha when she is in human form, but she refers to Tabitha as "Oneesama," which means "older sister." Though she is sensible, she is sometimes childish. Sylphid doesn`t live in the Academy like other familiars because she`s too big (as a dragon), so she stays in a neighboring forest. She promised to her "older sister" that she would not tell anybody about her ability to use nature magic (which allows her to shift between forms), but Derflinger eventually found out about her secret.</description>

<summary>Louise wakes up to hear Saito make perverted comments in his sleep, even comparing Louise`s chest into a flat plain and Siesta`s into a mountain range, resulting in her blowing him up. Colbert arrives to tell them they and their friends have been summoned to Romalia, where upon arriving they meet up with Julio, Henrietta, and Romalia’s pope Vittorio Serevare. Vittorio reveals that he knows Louise is a Void mage while also identifying himself, Tiffania, and Galia’s king Joseph as Void mages, and explains they must assemble as a group to save their world. Vittorio asks Louise and Tifa to help him in this endeavor by becoming his priestess`s and Louise readily accepts, leading to an argument with Saito over her decision. That night, Tifa asks Colbert to help her summon a familiar, Louise goes to investigate two suspicious people, and Siesta explains to Saito Louise’s’ reason for her decision. Louise confronts the two individuals, Jack &amp; Bleu, as they steal a mirror artifact, but she is caught. Saito arrives, so Jack battles him, allowing Bleu to escape, while below them Tifa begins her summoning ritual. Jack is defeated thanks to Louise’s magic, but Saito falls off the roof they are on and into the portal for Tifa’s ritual, coming out through the other side. The next morning Saito tells Louise he will support her and her decision and they reconcile with a kiss, which Tifa accidentally interrupts. Tifa then wonders if Saito could be her familiar, while also showing signs of having feelings for him.

Louise rejects all of Saito and Siesta’s choices, and becomes further irritated when Siesta reveals she too will be living with them. Things become worse for the girls when they discover Saito has become increasingly popular with women due to his heroic status, and so decide to hasten their efforts. Back in Galia, Tabitha is asked by her mother to become the new queen for both the country and her father’s sake. Three days later, Agnes brings Saito and Louise to Henrietta, who informs them that Tabitha will be Galia’s new queen and to reward Saito for his previous deeds with a portion of her territory. Saito, Louise, and Siesta arrive in their new land, Ornières, only to find that it is a forest and their mansion is old and decrepit, but stay anyway since it was a gift. That night, the trio is visited by Tabitha who reveals she will be moving in with them since she postponed her coronation.

On the ground, Tifa uses ancient magic to stop the gargoyle, allowing Tabitha to recover the stone. Joseph uses his void power, Acceleration, to move at high speed and subdue Saito, but Louise and Tabitha return and save him. Tabitha fatally wounds her uncle, but decides against killing him just as Sheffield returns and forces the group to leave her to die with Joseph, so the trio escapes just as the ship explodes from the last stone. Back at the Cathedral, Saito voices his suspicions that Vittorio used Louise as bait to lure Joseph and kill him, to which Vittorio admits. Louise tells Saito that it’s alright since she has him to protect her and he agrees, reaffirming their bond. Tifa, who was watching, both admires and is saddened by their close bond, believing it proves that Saito is not her familiar.

<summary>Louise and Saito enjoy some time alone as they explore the city of Aquileia. Henrietta asks Vittorio to keep Louise and Tifa safe but despite both his and Julio’s assurances Agnes and Henrietta still suspect trouble. Tifa wonders if she really did summon Saito and notes that now seeing him makes her feel flustered. Louise shows off her priestess outfit to Saito and they begin to get intimate but Malicorne ruins their moment. In Galia, Bidalsha creates fire stones for Joseph who reveals he will use them as weapons while Sheffield confirms that she will enact her plan tomorrow. The next day, Tifa tries to confirm if Saito is her familiar by kissing him, but the two are interrupted by Malicorne and Montmorency. Louise is taken aside by a peasant girl and when Saito goes to look for her he is ambushed by Bleu. The peasant girl reveals herself as Janette, Bleu’s sister, and subdues Louise and hands her over to Sheffield. Janette retrieves Bleu and informs Saito of Louise’s kidnapping, so he frantically searches for her to no avail. Saito and the others regroup and Tabitha reveals the kidnappers are from Galia, meaning Joseph is behind the kidnapping. Before they can act, they are informed that Galia’s airships are heading towards Romalia. Onboard one of the ships, Joseph introduces himself to Louise and tells her he will use her as part of his plan.

<summary>Louise and Saito are seen dancing in the grand ballroom after Tabitha`s coronation, with Louise lost in the thought of Saito`s life-risking Liveslatille power. The next day Siesta walks into Louise and Saito`s room to see Louise sitting on the edge of the bed. Agnes arrives and informs Louise that she, Saito, and Tiffania are called on by Princess Henrietta. Henrietta then tells them that the Pope of Romalia has requested their help, and calls upon Sylphid to escort them there. Upon reaching Romalia they see Aquileia being engulfed in flames and are attacked by a swarm of dragons. Gulio rescues them from a fire blast launched by an enormous dragon and escorts them to Romalia. The Pope requests the trio`s help to stop the legendary "ancient dragon," and asks that Saito uses his new-found abilities to stop it, to which Louise objects. When they arrive at the location where they will confront the dragon, Louise informs Saito of the consequences of using Liveslatille`s power, but he agrees to use them to protect Romalia and Louise. The accompanying army trap the dragon in a valley, and the Pope uses his Void magic on the dragon and its` army; it usually functions as a recovery spell, but has a damaging effect against entities of evil. Saito uses his powers to strengthen His Eminence, but the ancient dragon possesses Gulio`s dragon, causing it to move towards the dragon`s mouth as it begins blasting them with fire. Derflinger demands that Saito draws him to absorb the attack, but the dragons power proves too much and Derflinger shatters, propelling Saito off the back of the possessed dragon only to be caught by Louise and Tiffania. Knowing he can no longer fend off the dragon with his magic, the Pope shoves Gulio off the back of his dragon, rescuing him at the cost of being eaten by the ancient dragon.

<summary>The group arrives in Beautis, Gallia`s capital, and begins to ready for Tabitha`s coronation. Because Tiffania and Saito are getting closer together, Louise and Siesta worry that Tiffa might try and seduce Saito, so Louise then plans on reminding him who his original master is. Meanwhile, Luckshana and Ari are given a guest suite to stay in for the duration of the coronation. Guiche and Malicorne are asked to guard the two and stop them from disrupting the ceremony, but Lukshana insists on trying to leave and explore, and while attempting to stop her Guiche and Ari begin to argue. Saito arrives and asks for the two to get along, which they reluctantly agree to. Later, Louise requests that Saito help her get dressed in preparation for Tabitha`s coronation ceremony, and as Saito nervously tightens her dress, he notices Louise`s breasts have grown slightly. Louise asks if Saito regards her as his only master, but before he can answer Tiffania suddenly bursts in, asking that Saito help with her own dress. Louise chooses to handle it instead, but due to her unique breast size the button breaks and her breasts are revealed. Some time later, Luctiana escapes the guest suite and Guiche, Ari and Malicorne head out to look for her together. Princess Henrietta calls Louise, Saito, Tiffania are called to the palace`s throne room, where the Pope and Gulio are also present. After congratulating Tabitha on her accepting the role of Gallia`s new queen, Louise explains how her new Void magic, known as the "World Door," was used to rescue Saito and Tiffania, followed by Saito revealing his new runes to His Eminence who identifies them as Liveslatille; god`s heart, which allows him to boost the power of a Void user`s magic. While returning to their rooms, the trio run into Kirche and Montmorency and agree to spend a girls-only night with Tabitha and Sylphid to celebrate her upcoming coronation and their last night together. While going to Tabitha`s room, the four find Guiche questioning a maid as to Lukshana`s location, with Montmorency mistaking the situation as flirting. Seeing how Guiche and Montmorency`s relationship is similar to his own with Lukshana, he and Ari come to an understanding and return to the guest suite. The girls run into Lukshana outside of Tabitha`s room, and she and Montmorency also come to get along. The following morning Tabitha is crowned the new queen. While preparing for the party following the coronation, Louise brings up her question from the previous day. Saito states that who his first master is irrelevant, because his love is only for her. Worrying that they`d be late for the party he goes on ahead, leaving Louise behind. While searching for him she overhears a conversation between the Pope and Gulio, discussing a consequential side-effect of Saito`s new-found familiar power: while his new runes give him the power to boost Void magic, the user`s strength gradually diminishes with every use, which would eventually result in the user`s death. His Eminence had failed to inform Saito of this as he feared that the consequences would frighten him, as well as knowing that this power would be required to overcome a peril that could threaten the entire world. Shocked at hearing this, Louise worries that she`ll lose Saito.
