<description>Saint Seiya is a story from Masami Kurumada about warriors called `Saints` whose task is to protect, and to fight against evil forces. There are also evil Saints in the story who are on the hostile side. It is said that every 200 years an evil will come back to earth and try to rule the world, and at the same time, the Goddess Athena will be reincarnated to prevent the evil from accesion to power on earth. The story has five main chacters: Seiya the Pegasus Saint, Shiryu the Dragon Saint, Shun the Andromeda Saint, Hyoga the Cygnus Saint, and Ikki the Phoenix Saint. The task of these Saints is to protect Athena, the Goddess of peace, and to defeat the evil forces. The Saints wear special armour, which each has deserved after years of hard training. Their armour not only protects them from external impacts, but also gives them special abilities. The armour represents a star constellation, from which a Saint also gains his power, called cosmo. The cosmo of a Saint is like an aura. According to the story, everyone has a cosmo, which he/she is able to discover.

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Battles or tournament matches that last much longer than needed (compared to other genres) - perhaps even spanning several episodes.
	
Filler scenes are inserted between the action scenes, painfully lengthening the screen time even further. A long roster of characters (main, secondary, even extras) watches the events, expressing their opinions about the development of the match, trying to predict the outcome, explaining the rules to those who do not know them, and showing their amazement by an oh so surprising turn of events.</description>

<description>Under the tutelage of Shion, the Pope of the Sanctuary, Muu was able to become the Gold Saint of Aries at a young age. While all gold saints have a base of psychic powers to some degree, Muu has been stated to possess the strongest raw psychic talent among all living gold saints. This allows him to manipulate his gift to various degrees: psychokinesis, telepathy, teleportation, and various other powers are at his command.
Muu is very soft spoken, with a scholarly-like personality; his demeanor is very tranquil and logical, almost as if he is a professor of the Sanctuary. He is good friends with Taurus Aldebaran, and is very respectful to the 243 year old master Libra Douko.</description>

<description>Aldebaran is one of the 12 Guardians of Sanctuary, with the Taurus as his destined constellation. He was the physically strongest of the Gold Saints of modern era. He is Brazilian in origin.
Unlike most of the characters, Aldebaran is often depicted as a friendly guy, laughing and being less serious in times of peace. He was a good friend of Aries Mu, and with Pegasus Seiya (as this last is said in the anime adaptation of the Hades Saga, when Aldebaran sacrificed himself with the other eleven Gold Saints to destroy the Wailing Wall).</description>

<name>Pisces no Aphrodite</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Pisces Aphrodite is the last of the Gold Saints introduced by Kurumada in his manga, formally presented in vol.11. Aphrodite was a Saint famous not only because of his incredible, mesmerizing beauty, but also for his reputation as one of the strongest among the 88 Saints. However, this reputation is not explored very well in the series itself, as he is killed by Andromeda Shun rather easily by Gold Saint standards, and is beaten rather easily by Aries Mu during the Hades Saga.
Gold Saint Gemini Saga once stated that Aphrodite`s beauty was the greatest among Athena`s Saints. Kurumada named him after the Greek Goddess of love and beauty as a reference to the Greek myth associated to the Pisces constellation. However, Aphrodite never claimed to be the most beautiful creature, unlike the Silver Saint, Lizard Misty who claimed that even the stars` splendor dimmed next to his glory.
It is notable that despite his incomparable beauty, Aphrodite is not narcissistic. He is often described as cruel as his fellow Gold Saint, Cancer Deathmask, but not as sadistic. He is also ironic and sarcastic. According to Saga, despite his beauty, Aphrodite is the most feared of all the 88 Saints of Athena, however, as explained above, this may be due to his cruel nature as opposed to his fighting prowess. His reputation is supported more in the still non-canonical Saint Seiya Episode G, when Aphrodite appeared in front of the Titan`s soldiers who were awe-struck due to his beauty but also paralyzed by fear in his presence.
A recurring motif in the Pisces Saint is that he considers victory as the greatest beauty of all and, therefore, he believes what makes him really beautiful would not be his physique, but absolute power. Aphrodite is depicted as a man who believes the power is the only way to keep the order and assure the justice. Subscribing to this theory, he believes the stronger is allowed to rule over the weak.
Some casual fans believe Aphrodite is a female because of his name. In the French, European Spanish -first dubbing- and Chinese dubbing of the anime adaptation, he is voiced by a female actress.</description>

<description>Along with Leo Aiolia, Saga disguised as the Pope was the first Gold Saint that Masami Kurumada introduced in his manga, although their rank wasn`t revealed until later volumes. In his first appearance, Saga presided the event in which Pegasus Seiya acquired the status of Saint. In the anime adaptation, he was introduced in identical manner, in episode 1.
Saga managed to put himself in control of the sanctuary treacherously for many years after killing Pope Shion, the original Grand Pope of Sanctuary by stealing his identity.
Saga is often described by other characters as someone with the kindness of an angel but with the darkness of a demon. This ambivalence ended up creating a split personality: a good Saga that was extremely loyal to Athena and an evil one that keeps control of the body most of the time and killed the previous Pope to steal his place. When it takes control of Saga`s body, his hair turns from blond to jet-black (the color schemes were altered for the anime, in which Saga`s normally blue hair turned light grey). Saga`s two "sides", can also communicate between them : in a dialogue the good Saga reproaches his evil "side" to have forced him to hurt Athena.</description>

<description>Deathmask was one of the first Gold Saints to be shown in both manga and the anime adaptation. Since his first appearance, he was depicted as a very sadistic and malevolent man who used his power as he wanted without bending to Athena`s will. Deathmask covers his temple with the faces of his fallen victims - warriors and civilian men, women and even innocent children. Deathmask is one the few Saints who knows the truth about the Pope and the Gemini Saint, along with Pisces Aphrodite, but he continues obeying his orders. He believes that justice is not a real concept and is just a name given to the will of the stronger, since those with power can force their wills on the weak and call it fair. Even after joining sides with Athena, Deathmask remains a diabolic, sadistic person, facing Aries Mu and Pegasus Seiya without showing remorse and even attempting to kill the latter. In the US version his name was changed to Mephisto. It is unknown if Deathmask is his real name or a title since he collects the faces of his victims.</description>

<description>As Masami Kurumada uses the revered Osamu Tezuka`s Star System, (A stable cast of characters which play a different or similar role in the author`s various works, sometimes with the same personality and sometimes with an entirely new one), he designed Aiolia`s appearance very similar to Zaji, the main character in Raimei no Zaji, a manga that Kurumada wrote and drew years before Saint Seiya.
In his manga, Kurumada gave Aiolia blonde hair. In the anime adaptation, due to a relative excess of yellow tones in Kurumada`s design, Aiolia`s hair color was modified to light brown to achieve a better color balance and contrast.</description>

<name>Virgo no Shaka</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Although Gemini Saga and Leo Aiolia were the first Gold Saints introduced by Masami Kurumada in his manga, Virgo Shaka was the first one he showed fully revealing his status as Gold Saint and wearing his Gold Cloth, in the chapter 18, contained in vol. 5.
Shaka is one of the Twelve Gold Saints. As the guardian of the Temple of Virgo along the path of Sanctuary, Shaka has played a pivotal role chiefly in the battle between Athena and the Pope in the Sanctuary arc, and also in the Hades arc. He is referred to many times on the story as the "the man who is almost a god" due to his immense power and is also considered the only Gold Saint that has full control over the Araya Shiki (8th sense). He is supposed to be Buddha`s reincarnation.
Shaka alone of all saints occupies the rarefied spot between God and man, but living between two worlds has its blessings as well as curses. As a Bodhisattva, and endowed with the most powerful cosmos of all the saints, Shaka well deserves his reputation as the man closest to God. Even as a child in India, Shaka was precocious and communed with God himself—a scene recounted in the flashbacks moments before Shaka`s death in the Twin Sala`s Garden. For someone whose life has just begun, he had been unusually sensitive to sufferings and mortality of human life. Seeing pain and death as reflected in the Ganges gives the boy Shaka enough despair, if not a crisis of faith. With esoteric learning and training, Shaka eventually became powerful enough to don the Gold Cloth of Virgo, which he wore even as a boy in the manga, and wise enough to rise above human passions and attachments. For most of his life, he would look on human feelings with a mix of pity and compassion without being bound to them, with charity but not always with love. Detachment seems to be Shaka`s answer to the poignant questions raised by human life, and he is seeing humanity from the point of God rather than living the experience. He would be disabused of this attitude in his encounter with Ikki. In the end, Shaka would have to remember that he is a man, as well, and return to whence he came.</description>

<name>Capricorn no Shura</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Shura belongs to the fabled rank of Gold Saint hierarchy among the other 12 Gold Saints. His guardian star is of the zodiac sign of Capricorn. Shura is the Gold Saint that underwent some modifications in his ideology when the manga was adapted to animation. While the anime series shows Shura as being the most loyal Saint to Athena, Kurumada depicted in his manga a Capricorn Saint that at first was somewhat reluctant, but short moments before his death, rediscovered his loyalty to Athena, and remained faithful to her even after his death. According to the manga, Shura, just like Cancer Deathmask and Pisces Aphrodite, knew that Gemini Saga was behind the Pope`s mask but he still was obeying his orders. As he says in his fight against Shiryu, he doesn`t believe anyone fights for a god anymore, so he doesn`t care about fighting for Athena. He considered that those with power, were automatically qualified to be judged just. He thought that the Pope, even being evil, using that power, could use it for some good.
The new Saint Seiya Episode G manga, authored by Megumu Okada under commission by Masami Kurumada, although still non-canonical, shows a version of Shura that conciliate both previous versions: here, Shura is a very loyal Gold Saint, but when he discovers the truth about Gemini Saga, he is attacked by the Demon Emperor Fist, a technique that controls the mind of its victim. According to Saga`s will, Shura starts to follow his orders, but remains loyal to Athena at heart. Masami Kurumada named Shura after Asura, the Hindu demon who eternally hungers for battle and war.</description>

<description>He is a Gold Saint, guardian of the temple of Aquarius, and also Cygnus Hyoga and Kraken Isaac`s master in manga. In the anime, he was the master of the Crystal Saint, who was Hyoga and Isaac`s master. Camus is a cold looking Saint, since he believes the Gold Saint, as the strongest among Athena`s guards, should never show exasperation or it would draw the people into despair. In the manga, he reveals that he actually knew that the Pope wasn`t working under Athena`s will, but he still kept working under his orders to fulfill his role as the Aquarius Gold Saint. Even so, he was glad to see his pupil Hyoga fighting for the real Athena. Since Milo fought Hyoga, he mentioned Camus in a way that led the fans to believe they were close friends. Apparently, this was made official since the animation of the Hades saga included more personal interaction between them than the manga, and they are depicted as friends in Saint Seiya Episode G. He is named after Albert Camus.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kanon is a character with a substantial importance in the universe of Kurumada`s manga, and therefore in its anime adaptation. He is directly responsible for triggering two main events : the conflict of the 12 temples by inciting Gemini Saga to succumb to his evil desires, and the resurrection of Poseidon, Emperor of the Seas. Also, Kanon is notable for redeeming himself after all his sins in the past and wreaking havoc as the Gemini Gold Saint in the army of Hades` 108 [[Specters.
Kanon is the younger twin brother of Gold Saint Gemini Saga, and later took up his position as a Gold Saint after Saga`s death. Before finally embracing his destiny as the Gemini Saint, Kanon masqueraded as the Sea Dragon General of the North Atlantic, one of Poseidon`s seven Sea Generals. At first, Kanon was depicted as a treacherous man, always tempting his twin brother to use his status and power to advance his status of influence beyond that of a Gold Saint. He concluded that their amazing and powerful abilities were gifts from the Gods for them to take advantage of. Much to his dismay, his brother opposed this and caused his incarceration at Cape Sounion. After his redemption, however, Kanon becomes a much centered person, much like his brother.
Kanon was the one person responsible for Poseidon`s awakening, although he kept Poseidon just half awakened so that he could pose as the true leader of the Marines as a Marine General and use Poseidon`s army to achieve his desires. In order to do so, Kanon stole the scales of Sea Dragon and pretended to be the Sea Dragon General under Poseidon`s order. Even after joining forces with the Athena, Kanon retains his ruthless personality and harsh characteristics, scolding Pegasus Seiya and Andromeda Shun that they should never hesitate to finish their enemies, because their hesitation was a weakness that their enemies would take advantage of. Even so, he quickly absorbs the honor of a Gold Saint.</description>

<description>Kurumada introduced Aiolos in chapter 24 of his manga, contained in vol. 6.
He is one of the 12 Guardians of Sanctuary, with the Sagittarius as his destined constellation. Aiolos is the famous gold saint who died protecting Athena when she was an infant.
Aiolos always was a paradigm of righteousness, seen as the perfect Saint and one of the two Gold Saints who could succeed Aries Shion as the next Pope of Sanctuary and the chosen one.
Not much is known about Aiolos, since he died before the main story began. More of him is seen in Saint Seiya Episode G, like his relationship with Garan, a servant of his young brother, Leo Aiolia, who once trained with Aiolos for the Sagittarius cloth.
Despite his condition, Aiolos managed to help the main characters many times sending his cloth to aid them.
Aiolos is probably named after the Greek god of Wind, Aeolus.</description>

The first Gold Saint he introduced revealing his rank was Virgo Shaka, in vol.5. In the anime adaptation, these introductions occur in the same manner, although Shaka`s is delayed and the first Gold Saint that appeared fully wearing a Gold Cloth was Scorpio Milo.
Milo is the Scorpio Gold Saint. Since his main technique inflicts immense pain to its victims, Milo always gives his opponents the option to either surrender, or become insane due to the unbearable pain. He also sees great importance in the pride of the Gold Saints and seems to be always ready to clean the name of his companions. Even so, he is a noble warrior who can admit defeat even against a weaker or inferior enemy. Since Milo fought Hyoga, he spoke to Aquarius Camus in a way that led the fans to believe they were close friends. Apparently, this was made official since the anime adaptation of the Hades arc of the manga included more interaction between them and they are depicted as friends in Saint Seiya Episode G.</description>

The Hydra Saint underestimated his opponent who froze him to near death. Ashamed by his defeat, he asked Saori for permission to undergo further training in Finland with his master. She agreed and thus Ichi didn`t reappear until Saori was put in danger in Sanctuary after being struck by a golden arrow. From then on, he served her as Athena and came to reside in Sanctuary. Later he protected Sanctuary from the revived Saints, and protected Pegasus Seiya`s sister from the death god Thanatos.

He was sent along with Misty, Asterion and Mozes to kill the Bronze Saints for their crimes against Sanctuary. However, due to Aries Mu`s intervention, they went after the wrong Saints, ending up killing the Black Saints instead. Believing they had accomplished their mission, they retreated, though Misty stayed behind to confirm his suspicions. After some time, Babel grew worried and returned to find Misty dead on the beach. Cygnus Hyouga soon arrived and challenged the Silver Saint, who was confused because he thought he had already killed the Bronze Saint. Babel regained his composure and fought, confident he had the advantage with his flames, but was ultimately defeated by Hyouga`s freezing Cosmo.

When Phoenix Ikki came back to his senses with the help of his fellow Bronze Saints, the Lizard Saint created a landslide in the hopes of burying them, but he was unsuccessful. Aries Mu created illusions which made the four Black Saints look like the Bronze Saints and teleported them all eight from the landslide. The Silver Saints were deceived by the illusion and went after the Black Saints but Eagle Marin and Misty went after the real Pegasus. Marin, in hopes of saving Seiya, attacked her pupil with an illusion attack and buried him. Misty however didn`t fall for it and took the Bronze Saint out of his grave and attacked him. The Silver Saint told Seiya that he had never been bruised in battle and that itself was true victory in Misty`s view, never to be hurt by an opponent. During the fight some blood from Seiya fell on Misty, who was disgusted by it cleaned it off. Thus, he removed his Cloth and went into the nearby sea. Seiya deemed him crazy and as soon as Misty donned his Cloth again, the battle continued. After, a hard battle, Pegasus Seiya overcame Misty`s attacks and defeated him.

<description>A temperamental but courageous female Silver Saint, Athena`s prohibition of women becoming Saints demanded of Shaina to abandon her femininity when starting her training as a Saint and forever hide her face from men. Shaina was mentor to Pegasus Seiya`s rival Cassios, whose defeat seemingly caused Shaina to bear a grudge against Seiya. At first, Shaina served the false Pope of Sanctuary, as she was determined to take Seiya`s life for the humiliation she caused her, but later, suspicion towards him grew in her, which led her to side with the Bronze Saints in their rebellion against Sanctuary. Shaina saved Seiya`s life from Leo Aiolia, sent by the Pope to kill him; being gravely wounded herself, she revealed that her grudge derived not from the fact that Seiya defeated Cassios, but because Seiya was the first man to ever see Shaina`s face, the worst offence against a female Saint. Rigid tradition forced female Saints to either of two choices: either kill the offender or fall in love with him, Shaina unwillingly choosing the latter. Convalescing during the conflict of the twelve temples, Shaina is shocked to learn about her pupil Cassios` death to save Seiya`s life, to spare her from grieving. Shaina then saves Eagle Marin`s life, who moments before had saved Seiya`s in the funeral roses stairway. After the false Pope is defeated, Shaina pledges her loyalty to Athena. Despite her love towards Seiya being unrequited, during the battle against Poseidon, Shaina is instrumental in the victory of Athena`s army, being sent by Libra Roushi to bring the Bronze Saints the imprescindible Libra Gold Cloth and going as far as to challenge Poseidon herself, but suffering defeat. Mere weeks later, Shaina leads the Bronze Saints and the rankless soldiers of Sanctuary in the protection of the surroundings, after the invasion of Hades` army. In the climax of the battle against Underworld, Shaina valiantly risks her life to protect Seiya`s sister Seika from the assault of the merciless Thanatos.

The Phoenix Saint warned the other Bronze Saints that Algol was different from his friends, and Algol soon turned Andromeda Shun into stone with the Shield of Medusa, which could petrify opponents when it opened its eyes. Algol then battled with Dragon Shiryuu, but was outsmarted when the Dragon Saint blinded his eyes with his own fingers so that he could not see the Medusa Shield, as last resort to stop Algol and save the other Bronze Saints` lives. After a lengthy battle, Algol charged for a final attack, but was in the end defeated by Shiryuu, who heightened his Cosmo to "see" beyond his blindness.

<summary>As the bronze saints wait for Shun (Andromeda) before departing for Greece, they are unaware that he is battling for his life against vengeful old friends from his homeland. Believing that it is his destiny is to die at the hands of these friends, Shun submits and accepts his fate. Slipping in and out of consciousness, Shun has a vision of his brother Ikki (Phoenix). In the vision, Ikki convinces Shun that he controls his own destiny based on the choices he makes in life, and he has a choice of whether or not to accept his own death. Shun snaps out of unconsciousness and defeats his attackers, then joins his friends to leave for Greece. On the plane, Saori informs the bronze saints that there are in fact
twelve gold saints, one for each sign of the Zodiac, and that ArIes is actually a gold saint with two sides, one good and one bad. He is not in fact the evil brother of the previous and assumed deceased-pope he is one and the same. Aioria returns to Greece after battling Seiya, and learning the truth of ArIes`s evil ways, and he confronts ArIes to accuse him of wrongdoing; a battle ensues. The two are evenly matched and neither can gain an advantage over the other, but Shaka, another gold saint, arrives and defends the pope as he has sworn to do. Shaka and Aioria battle it out, seemingly defeating one another as ArIes watches on in amusement. The bronze saints make it to Greece, and they are met by Shiryu who has flown on ahead. A mysterious man in a cloak greets them and leads them to pope ArIes`s residence. He informs them that there are twelve rooms they must pass through before they will be able to face the pope, and, of course, each house has its own guard. Each house also corresponds to a sign of the Zodiac. The disguised man informs them that no one has ever made it through the 12 houses before without dying. The disguised man then surprises them by ripping offhis cloak and mask and informing them that he is Tremy of Sagitta. Tremy threatens that he won`t even let them through the first house, and fires golden arrows at them. Seiya defeats him easily but not before Tremy wounds Saori with an arrow through the heart.

Meanwhile, Seiya and Shiryu are figuring this out for themselves in another area of the house, but Shiryuusing his sixth sense, since he`s still blind-leads Seiya through the illusions and out of the Gemini house towards the Cancer house. Angered by his lack of foresight (Shiryu not being able to see, thus the illusion not affecting him), ArIes, who was in fact creating the illusions from afar, uses all of his mighty powers to attack Shun and Cygnus.

<summary>Seiya`s attacks are futile against Aioria `s gold armour. Aioria scoffs at Seiya`s bronze saints` abilities and then breaks Seiya`s leg with his powerful "Lightning Voltage" attack. Seiya cannot understand why all of a sudden Aioria is so full of evil and hatred, especially after swearing to uphold justice and protect Athena. Meanwhile, just down the hill, Shina is recovering from her wounds sustained in Japan, and Cassis tends to her. In her sleep, Shina reveals her feelings for Seiya and expresses her worry for his welfare; Cassios overhears this. When Shina awakes, Cassios informs her that Seiya and the other bronze saints have come to Greece and have made it as far as the house of Leo on their quest to defeat ArIes. Cassios reveals that while Aioria was busy fighting the gold saint Shaka in the pope`s chamber (following Aioria`s attack on ArIes), ArIes attacked Aioria with his legendary "Imperial Satan" spell, a mind control device that allows ArIes to control those under this spell. So, Aioria is now an evil gold saint fighting for ArIes. Upon hearing this, Shina tries to rush to Seiya`s side, but she is too weak and collapses. As Aioria stands over a broken Seiya and prepares to deliver the final blow, that will end his fighting days, we …

<summary>In sadistic fashion, Shaka tortures Phoenix with his incredible gold saint powers, but even after ridding Phoenix of his senses and leaving him physically destroyed, Shaka cannot seem to finish off the strong-willed bronze saint. Shun comes-to and tries to help his ailing brother, but through communicative thoughts, Phoenix tells him to back off; `this is his fight.` Shaka continues his attack on a defenceless Phoenix, but now he seems unable to do any damage to him, like he`s protected by an unknown force field. Shaka has never seen anything like this before. Who is protecting Phoenix? And why? It turns out that Phoenix`s is protecting himself with his awesome brainpower. Angered and frustrated, Shaka tries to destroy Phoenix`s brain as well, but he is too late. Phoenix has been down so low that he cannot go any deeper. He has searched his soul and found his inner seventh-sense power. Due to his inner goodness and pure heart, Phoenix becomes more powerful than Shaka could ever dream of becoming and he begins to overpower Shaka. But Phoenix knows that the only way he can truly destroy Shaka is by sacrificing his own life to take Shaka`s. So he does just that. Phoenix grabs hold of a stunned Shaka and burns up all of his powerful energy in an intense heat. By building up a massive burst of energy Phoenix explodes and takes Shaka with him, into a million bits. Shun and the others shed a tear for their fallen friend, but they know he died for them and they must now rush off to save Saari, as they only have six hours left.

He thinks back on the days when he was training to be a saint, and on the relationship he developed with his girlfriend Shunrei. We find Shunrei praying for Shiryu to return to her safely, but her positive and powerful thoughts of prayer are interfering with Death Masks evil energy. Death Mask worries that her prayers may help Shiryu return from the gates of death again, so, to ensure this doesn`t happen, Death Mask goes to the gates of death to finish-off Shiryu once and for all! He collects the weak Shiryu in his arms, and carries him to the mouth of death to drop him inside, but again Shunrei` s prayers begin to interfere with Death Mask`s plans.

We then find Ikki (Phoenix), who has been resting on a nearby volcanic island to heal the wounds he suffered during his last battle. He is attacked by some of ArIes`s men who were sent to find him.

<summary>Seiya, Shun and Shiryu cautiously enter the house of Virgo, and confront a closed-eyed Shaka. In tum, they each attack Shaka, but it is of no use. Shaka`s power is the greatest they have yet to face: the force that they use to attack him with is simply returned upon them tenfold. Shaka mocks them for their weakness and is angered because he realizes that the only way they could have made it this far is by the betrayal of the gold saints in the houses beneath him. Just as Shaka prepares to kill the bronze saints, in walks Phoenix to save the day…or does he? Shaka gives Phoenix a choice: either he Gan die, or get down on his knees and accept Shaka as his god, Budda. Phoenix mocks the crazy gold saint for believing that he is the reincarnation of Budda, and chooses to die rather than kneel in front of such an evil saint. True to his word, Shaka attacks Phoenix with his Herculean powers. Shaka shows Phoenix the six worlds of the dead and asks him to choose the one in which he would like to live after he is dead.

Shaka is, however, impressed by Phoenix`s resiliency and he offers to let him live if he leaves immediately. Phoenix refuses to leave without his friends, before they have defeated ArIes and saved Saori (Athena). So, Shaka begins attacking him again. Shaka blasts Phoenix`s bronze saint`s armour from his body and renders him utterly defenceless. Phoenix laughs at Shaka and tells him that no matter how powerful he is, his Phoenix armour can never be destroyed; it will forever rebuild itself from ruin. Shaka is quick to point out that if Phoenix dies the powers of his armour aren`t of importance. Then, Shaka opens his eyes and unleashes a demonstrative attack, which paralyses Phoenix, removes his ability to speak and strips him of his senses.

concentration, infiltrating his forbidding mind control powers, and he loses control of his death-grip on Shim, saving him for the time being. That someone is Ikki, the bronze saint Phoenix, who is recovering from wounds sustained during his last battle far away from Greece. Since no one has ever been able to break into his mind before, ArIes is surprised that Ikki was capable of such a feat. But ArIes quickly shrugs it off and returns to trying to destroy Shun, by sending him into another dimension to join his friend Cygnus. But, like Seiya discovered fighting Alderbaran, Shun finds his seventh-sense and shocks saint Gemini (ArIes mind control) with a powerful attack. Shun saves himself, and angers ArIes, or is it ArIes?! After Shun`s desperate attack, another ArIes appears beside the old one? Are there two of them? Are they twins? Stay tuned.

When he arrived back to his own dimension, Cygnus found himself in the house of Libra. There, he met Crystal`s (Cygnus`s mentor) mentor the gold saint of Aquarius. Aquarius informs Cygnus that he has been ordered not to let Cygnus through this house, and he attacks Cygnus as he tries to pass. Unwilling to fight Aquarius, his acting mentor, Cygnus tries instead to convince him of ArIes`s evil ways, hoping this will persuade him into letting him pass. It doesn`t work. Instead, Aquarius has his own agenda: to help Cygnus discover his seventh-sense. But Cygnus is unwilling to let go of the memory of his mother and is subsequently held back and unable to achieve his seventh-sense power. So, wanting Cygnus to die painlessly, instead of at the hands of an evil gold saint, Aquarius attacks Cygnus with a powerful blow and enshrines him in a large block of ice. Is Cygnus dead?

She decides to take out her anger by attacking ArIes, but Aioria stops her from making this grave mistake. The bronze saints enter the house of Libra where they discover Cygnus buried in a large block of ice. They surmise that the only one capable of doing such a thing is the gold saint Aquarius. As they inspect Cygnus`s unique coffin a little closer, they sense his energy and are happy to learn that he is still alive. But they are unable to free him from his predicament; Aquarius`s ice-block is unbreakable even by the gold saints. But luckily, they find a way. Shiryu`s mentor, the gold saint of Libra, sends his gold armour to them. The gold armour of Libra is a special one in that it can change into 12 different weapons. The trick, however, is knowing which one to choose for the desired result you want. After testing each set of weapons, Shiryu chooses the sword; it is the correct choice. He wields it well and frees his cold friend. Shun volunteers to tend to his teeth-chattering friend while Shiryu and Seiya run on ahead to the next house to save Saori.

Cygnus tries to mount an attack, but with limited strength, it is useless. Milo then asks Cygnus why he didn’t remain asleep in the block of ice, since Camus put him there for a reason : he is not able to let go of the memory of his mother thus cannot find his seventh-sense needed to defeat the gold saints. Milo takes pity on Cygnus and, out of respect for the gold saints Camus, agrees to let Cygnus live if he leaves the sancturary immediately. Cygnus refuges, claiming that he would rather die than disappoint his friend and Athena. Milo respects his with his wish and tries to destroy him, but with his back up against the wall and his senses leaving his body, Cygnus draws from the powerful energies of his friends and the goddess Athena to realise his seventh sense after all. He manages to deliver a powerful “ Aurora Thunder Attack” and freezes Milo’s gold armour rendering it useless. Milo recognaises that Cygnus has achieved his seventh sense and believes that maybe Saori is the real Athena after all. He tries to heal Cygnus’s wounds and wishes him well in the next house, but there is now only four hours left to save Saori.

Inside, they encounter the gold saint of Aquarius, Camus. To prove his great mentor worng (for freezing him in the large block of ice, bexause he felt Cygnus could never achieve his seventh sense) Cygnus Hyoga wants to fight Camus alone. So, he tells Shun and Seiya to go on ahead to defeat Arles without him. Camus’s powers are great; he is far superior to Cygnus and easily defeats him. But respecting his prodigy, Camus again chooses to freeze Cygnus inside a large block of ice rather than killing him ruthlessly. This time, however, to Camus’s surprise Cygnus is able to summon his seventh sense power and break out of the ice coffin. A greater battle ensues and both saints destroyed one another, altering the number of fallen bronze saints to three.

He then goes to the Arctic Ocean Mammoth Pillar. Ikki heads to Poseidon`s Temple, hoping his friends will remain strong and focus on saving Athena. Hyoga arrives at the pillar and senses a familiar cold air. A Mariner General greets him, and he is revealed to be Issac, Hyoga`s training partner when he trained with the Crystal Saint. Now the Mariner General Kraken Issac, he attacks Hyoga, leaving him confused because Issac used to fight for justice and wonders why he has changed. As children, Issac and Hyoga were close friends and grew strong together as the years went by under the Crystal Saint`s training. Issac`s dream was to become a powerful Saint and fight for justice to protect the Earth. He thought Hyoga`s goal was the same. In the present, Hyoga noticed Issac`s left eye is nothing but a scar now. Hyoga, sorry for Issac`s pain, allows him to destroy one of his eyes as payment. Issac, however, only hurt his eyelid. He then reminds Hyoga of the Kraken legend. The Kraken used to devour ships in one fell swoop, but only attacked people with evil intentions. Issac wanted to have the Kraken`s cruelty to defeat evil and fight for peace. One day, Issac found out the real reason why Hyoga wanted to be a Saint, to be able to see his mother in the sunken ship. Angered and disappointed, Issac attacks Hyoga, but at the same time, shows him how to break the ice caps. He also warned Hyoga that if he swims to the bottom, a strong current would trap him, and he would never be seen again. Hyoga finally broke the ice cap, and swims, but is caught in the current. Issac swims down to rescue his friend, who is unconscious. Suddenly, the current traps both of them. Issac`s eye was wounded by a stalactite and tries to break a hole in the ice cap to save Hyoga. He succeeds in saving Hyoga, but Issac is dragged across the ocean, leading him to Poseidon`s Sanctuary. Issac found out overtime that Hyoga became the Cygnus Bronze Saint, fought against the Sanctuary and killed his masters, Crystal Saint and Aquarius Camus. That`s when Issac decided to become a Mariner General. He then attacks his former friend with his Aurora Borealis.

In his mind, Bud defeats Syd, but for some reason, he can`t give him the death blow. Ikki confronts Bud about trying to help out Syd during his battle with Shun, even though he claimed he wanted Syd dead. Ikki and Bud clash again, with Ikki coming out on top after awakening his Seventh Sense. Suddenly, Syd sneaks up on Ikki and holds him so that Bud can defeat him.

Ikki tells Bud that he will not stop Bud`s attack, but something holds him back. Syd dies at that very moment, and Bud realizes what was holding him back, was the love he had for his brother. Ikki explains that even though brothers can sometimes hate or kill one other, they never forget when they cared about each other. Bud leaves, with Syd in his arms, believing in the world Ikki fights for, a world where brothers who are separated, can reunite and live happily.

Bud heads out into the blizzard with his brother, hoping they will be reborn in a home with no conflict.

<summary>Kiki arrives to the South Atlantic pillar and hands Shun a weapon to destroy the pillar. Seiya attacks again, but Poseidon sends his attacks back to him. Meanwhile, at the North Atlantic Mammoth Pillar, Ikki comes back and confronts Kanon, saying that Saga was stronger than his brother. After blocking the Galaxian Explosion, Ikki uses the Phoenix Illusion on Kanon and having him reveal his secret. Thirteen years ago, Kanon tried to convince his brother, Saga, to kill Athena, who was a baby at the time, and to kill the Pope who chose Aiolos as his successor. Saga then locked his brother in the prison at Cape Sounion, where Athena locked her enemies from ancient wars, until his evil heart would be purified. Kanon then assures Saga that his heart is just as evil, and at that moment, the evil inside Saga awakens (which would begin Saga`s reign of terror in the Sanctuary Chapter). Saga leaves his brother, with Kanon swearing to kill his brother and Athena. During his time in the prison, Kanon almost died many times, but a gentle Cosmo saved his life every time. One day, Kanon found Poseidon`s Trident sealed by Athena, in the prison. When he removed the seal, Kanon was dragged to Poseidon`s Sanctuary. When he entered the temple, he accidentally freed Poseidon`s soul and using the name Sea Dragon, informed him of Athena reincarnating on Earth. Poseidon told Kanon that whenever he revives, he takes over the body of a member of the Solo family. In this case, the member in the Solo family is three-year-old Julian. Since Athena can`t do anything as a baby, Poseidon slept in Julian`s body and told Kanon to wake him up in thirteen years, when the Mariners have gathered. As Poseidon left, Kanon wore the Sea Dragon Scales, swearing to manipulate Julian and the Mariner Generals, rule both the Earth and the sea, also to keep Poseidon asleep forever. Now that Ikki knows the truth, Kanon prepares to finish him off. Meanwhile, at Poseidon`s temple, Seiya gets up again and prepares to fire a golden arrow at the God of the Sea.

Hilda suddenly arrives and attempts to finish off Seiya, but Siegfried stops her to confirm his doubts. They attack again, with Seiya`s Meteors pushing back Siegfried`s Dragon Bravest Blizzard and attacking his heart. Seiya has finally won and goes to retrieve the Sapphire. But a man, playing a flute arrives and introduces himself as a Mariner General serving the God of the Sea Poseidon, Siren Sorrento. He has come from the Sanctuary of the Sea, under Poseidon`s orders to take Hilda with him. Sorrento reveals that Poseidon took control of Hilda with the Nibelung Ring, in order to control the world ruled by Athena and kill her. Seiya tries to stop Sorrento, but his music is affecting his mind, leaving him vulnerable for an attack. Siegfried, now realizing the truth and Seiya being right, he hands over the final Odin Sapphire to him. He then goes to fight Sorrento, using the last of his strength. Sorrento plays his flute, with his Dead End Symphony, which is similar to the Siren of Greek Mythology that lures sailors with its music to devour them. Siegfried covers his ears and destroys his eardrums to stop hearing the music, but its useless since it goes directly to the brain. Even though Siegfried is attacked, he still goes to fight Sorrento and holds onto him. Using his last bit of strength, Siegfried takes Sorrento, rising to the sky, sacrificing himself to kill the General. He entrusts Asgard and Hilda to Seiya, who swears his death will not be in vain. With all seven Odin Sapphires in hand, Seiya must now face Hilda in order to save Athena.

As the flood continues, the corpses of the God Warriors (including Bud, who succumbed to his wounds) are shown. Seiya`s friends regain consciousness and so does Hilda. She then takes the Balmung sword and prays for everything to be returned to normal, while Seiya, Shaina, Marin and their friends head towards Athena.

The flooding stops and Saori`s Cosmo returns to her, waking up, much to everyone`s relief. Hilda comes down to apologize to everyone and reunites with her sister Freya.

<summary>There is pouring rain and floods in all parts of the globe. Tatsumi, Jabu and the other Saints are aware of the panic around the world and wonder what is happening. In Asgard, Seiya and Shun return to Hilda and Freya, with no trace of Saori`s whereabouts, but they do believe Poseidon has taken her to the underwater Sanctuary. Saori awakens and encounters Poseidon, but she recognises him as Julian Solo. She first met him during his 16th birthday party. Julian Solo`s family is one of the wealthiest sea merchants in the world and he is the heir. When he met Saori, he proposed marriage to her, but she respectfully declined. Julian was chosen as Poseidon`s reincarnation and vessel. Poseidon tells her that the rain will continue for 30 days, and the water will remain for 150 days, killing all of humanity, but spared Saori, since he is still in love with her. He offer Saori the chance to rule beside him, but once again she rejects him. Saori is willing to sacrifice herself, and hopes her Saints will arrive to crush Poseidon`s ambition. Back in Asgard, Hilda and Freya discover ancient texts that reveal a path to Poseidon`s Sanctuary. The path is a giant whirlpool, and Seiya and Shun are sucked in. They arrive at the underwater Sanctuary, and there`s no water since the water is held up above them. Suddenly, Mermaid Thetis, a Mariner working for Poseidon appears. Seiya and Shun chase after her, trying to see if she knows where Saori is. Thetis tries to trap them using her Coral Trap to encase them in coral, but Seiya destroys it. Just then, the Mariner General, Sea Dragon, appears and easily defeats the Saints with one strike.

<summary>Sea Dragon approaches Ikki, but he has sensed this Cosmos before. He then attacks Ikki with a Galaxian Explosion, destroying his helmet. Ikki demands Sea Dragon to reveal who he is. He removes his helmet, and he reveals himself to be Gemini Saga`s twin brother, Gemini Kanon, who is pure evil. Kanon sends Ikki to another dimension, using his Golden Triangle, which resembles the Bermuda Triangle. He then claims he will rule both the Earth and the sea. Seiya recovers, sensing Saori`s weakened Cosmos. Shaina is still fighting Thetis and is able to defeat her with her Thunder Claw. As she leaves, Thetis warns her about fighting Poseidon, who is now a god. Shaina arrives at the Temple, remembering Juilan Solo is a rich merchant and never had any training. But he exposes a powerful Cosmo, just as strong as Athena`s. Shaina attacks, but Poseidon immobilizes and defeats her. Seiya senses Shaina`s Cosmos and heads to the Temple. Shiryu recovers and heads for the Temple as well. Kanon claims the Generals dying are according to his plan, but he encounters Sorrento, who has survived the battle against Siegfried in Asgard. As they talk, Sorrento doubts if Poseidon really started this battle and demands to know Kanon`s identity and if he revived Poseidon. They then sense a powerful Cosmos and return to their pillars. Shun arrives at the South Atlantic Mammoth Pillar and is shocked to see Sorrento. Back in his battle with Siegfried, Sorrento got loose and escaped his grasp, meaning Siegfried`s sacrifice was in vain. Shun is attacked by Sorrento`s Dead End Symphony, but is saved when they hear Athena singing from the Main Breadwinner.

Seiya fires again, and Poseidon controls the arrow, but Shaina protects Seiya, and the arrow hits her back. She tells Seiya he is their last hope and that he must not die. At the Sanctuary, a beam of light shoots from the House of Aquarius, heading for Poseidon`s temple. Shaina extracts the arrow from her back and hands it to Seiya, saying she will protect him, no matter what, and to fire as many times as necessary.

However, he is rescued by Shiryu, who has come from the Five Ancient Peaks of Lushan and brought information from Roshi. The master reveals that to remove the Nibelung Ring, one must have the legendary sword Balmung. To retrieve the sword, the seven Odin Sapphires, the seven God Warriors` guardian stones, must be gathered after defeating them. Shiryu goes to wake up Hyoga and Shun while Seiya distracts Thor, but Seiya is knocked down again. Saori`s Cosmos burns brightly and Seiya gets up to fight Thor. As the three Saints continue, Thor stands in their way, but Seiya comes back and executes a powerful Meteor of Pegasus which sends the giant crashing into a wall of ice. Saori`s Cosmos reminds Thor of when he first met Hilda. Thor used to hunt in the forests near the Valhalla Palace and gave the hunted prey to the poor people of Asgard. As he was hunted by the soldiers, Hilda arrived, apologized to Thor, since he was able to do something she couldn`t, and his wound was healed by Hilda`s gentle Cosmos. Since Hilda`s personality has completely changed, Thor has doubts about her intentions, but he ignores it and continues to fight. After Seiya is able to block Thor`s attack, both use their techniques again and clash, with Seiya earning the victory. Thor asks Seiya to restore Hilda to the way she was before, and falls to the ground, dead. Seiya picks up the first Odin Sapphire. The four Bronze Saints decide to split up to defeat the other God Warriors and reach the Valhalla Palace.

Ikki confronts him about not helping his brother, and Bud responds that if Syd dies, he will become the true God Warrior of Zeta, and no longer be a shadow. Ikki attacks, but Bud easily avoids his technique, because he was observing his battle with Mime. Ikki goes down and Bud keeps attacking him, while Shun struggles to help his brother. While fighting, Bud reveals that on the day he and Syd were born, his parents had to pick one to keep, because in Asgard, twins were hated. It was believed that twins would destroy a family. Syd and Bud`s father reluctantly abandoned the infant Bud in a forest, where a villager found him and raised him, while Syd was lucky enough to stay with his family. Years later, while hunting, Bud encountered his brother Syd without realizing it, until he noticed that they both had the same family daggers. As Syd left with his family, Bud put it all together and realized who Syd was. Enraged, Bud decided he would be superior to Syd. Later on, he was chosen as a God Warrior, but was still Syd`s shadow. Hilda tells Bud that he must stay hidden, but if Syd dies, Bud would become the God Warrior of Zeta. Ikki, feeling sorry for Bud, gets up, and for his brother`s sake, swears to win the battle.

He explains that the underwater Sanctuary has Mammoth Pillars that hold up the seven seas: the North Pacific, South Pacific, North Atlantic, South Atlantic, Indian, Arctic, and Antarctic Oceans. The Mammoth Pillar holding up the sea in its entirety is the Main breadwinner. If it is destroyed, the underwater Sanctuary will be no more. The water that is raining down on the Earth, now falls upon Saori while locked inside the Main Breadwinner, flooding the room inside, drowning her, giving humanity a chance. Also, the seven Mammoth Pillars are being protected by the Mariner Generals, Poseidon`s high ranking warriors said to be as powerful as the Gold Saints.

Meanwhile, Thetis stands in Shiryu`s way, but Kiki distracts her with his telekinesis while Shiryu leaves, unfortunately he is no match for the mermaid. Baian is confused as to why Seiya`s attacks reached him, but Seiya explains that he was able to attack him because Lizard Misty, the first Silver Saint he ever fought, used a similar defensive wall and saw through it. Baian`s Seahorse Scales were cracked due to Seiya`s Meteors. Baian attacks again, but his techniques are now useless against him. Seiya burns his Cosmo to the Seventh Sense and his Pegasus Cloth turns gold again. With a mighty Comet of Pegasus, Seiya finally kills Baian.

No matter what technique Shiryu uses, Siegfried is unscathed, making him wonder if he`s really immortal, just like the legend. Back at the caps, Saori can`t hold on anymore. Shiryu is struck by the Odin Sword technique and thinks about using the Final Dragon, like he did on Shura. He holds on to Siegfried and prepares the forbidden technique. Just then, Shura`s spirit talks to Shiryu and tells him not to do it, otherwise not only will he not protect Athena, the Odin Sapphire would be destroyed as well. Siegfried gets loose and uses the Dragon Bravest Blizzard on Shiryu. He then remembers Roshi`s lesson on a double-edge technique, and its weak point, which can not only hurt the opponent, but hurt the one who uses it. Shiryu tells Seiya to watch carefully and he burns his Cosmo to strike Siegfried at his weak point, his heart, just like Shiryu`s weak point when Seiya first fought him. Siegfried from the legend also had the same weak point. After killing the dragon, Siegfried became immortal after bathing in its blood. However, a leaf fell on his back, just behind his heart. Later that day, he was hit on that spot by a spear, thrown by someone jealous of him. He died due to his weak point. Shiryu accomplished what he needed to do in order to show Seiya Siegfried`s weak point, and faints. Seiya gets up for his friends to fight once more. Hilda waits by her throne, and is visited by someone working for the being who gave her the Nibelung Ring. Seiya has to strike Siegfried`s heart at a 100,000th of a second in order to win.

<summary>In Asgard, Hyoga is escaping with a young girl named Freya, Hilda`s younger sister. Asgard soldiers trap Hyoga and try to convince Freya to come back to her sister, but she refuses, hoping that Athena will save her sister. Hyoga defeats the soldiers. Then, Saori appears before Hyoga and Freya. Seiya, Shun and Kiki arrive, and Freya explains that Hilda is not acting like herself. The worst part is, the world is now in danger. Hilda was praying to stop the Polar ice caps from melting, but since Hilda stopped praying, the ice caps are melting and will flood the Earth. Hilda and her God Warriors suddenly appear before them. Saori notices the ring on Hilda`s finger. The ring is known as the Nibelung Ring, which turns its wearer evil. The Bronze Saints set out to reach the Valhalla Palace and remove the ring from Hilda`s finger in order to bring Hilda back to normal. Saori decides to stop the Polar ice caps from melting, but with her power, she can only contain the caps for 12 hours, before the sun sets. Hilda and her God Warriors leave, while Phecda Gamma Thor volunteers to stop the Saints.

<summary>Seiya, Hyoga and Shun rush to find the Valhalla Palace, which is farther away, but the giant God Warrior Thor stands in their way. Shun and Hyoga attack, but are useless against him as he easily breaks free from Hyoga`s ice and knocks down Shun with his Cosmo. Seiya decides to distract Thor, allowing Shun and Hyoga to move forward. Seiya stops Thor`s Mjolnir Hammer technique with his Meteor of Pegasus, but Thor simply changed their direction towards Shun and Hyoga, knocking them out cold. Seiya, now alone, manages to evade Thor`s Mjolnir Hammer, but before he is able to counterattack, Thor`s Titanic Hercules technique takes him out. Seiya is able to get up again and attacks with his Meteor of Pegasus, but Thor is able to block them and attacks again. As he lays in the snow, Seiya tries to figure out how to defeat Thor. Marin reminds him of the battle of the 12 Houses and how he was able to overcome the difficulties to save Athena. She says he has matured and has nothing left to teach him. Seiya remembers what he learned when he fought Taurus Aldebaran and Leo Aiolia, and how desperate he was to save Saori back then. He gets up, ready to fight once more. As Thor attacks again, Seiya tries to see the light speed attack and manages to stop it. He then sends Thor flying and crashing to the ground. Seiya then strikes with the Meteor of Pegasus and buries Thor in the snow. However, Thor gets up again, showing off a stronger Cosmo full of hatred. He explains how difficult life has been for the people of Asgard, and hopes that Hilda will lead the people to take control of the Sanctuary and the world. Seiya tries to explain that Hilda is possessed, but Thor ignores him and strikes with his Titanic Hercules, empowered by his strengthened Cosmo.

<summary>Shiryu seems to be no match against Fenrir`s ruthless attacks. His friends sense he is in danger, but are confident they will make it to the Valhalla Palace. Meanwhile, Hyoga is followed by another God Warrior.

Years ago, when Fenrir was six years old, he was part of a distinguished family. One day, he, his parents and their friends rode their horses through the woods. Suddenly, a huge bear slashed Fenrir`s mother, killing her. As his father tried fighting off the bear, their friends abandoned them and ran off. Fenrir`s father was also killed. Just then, a pack of wolves came to his rescue. From that day on, he was raised by those wolves and cared for them deeply. Later, Fenrir became the Alioth God Warrior and swore loyalty to Hilda. Shiryu is struck down again and almost eaten by the wolves, but Saori`s Cosmos weaken the wolves and revitalizes Shiryu. Both warriors face off once again, with Fenrir`s Wolf Cruelty Claw easily overpowering Shiryu Rising Dragon.
