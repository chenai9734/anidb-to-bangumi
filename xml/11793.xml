<name>magical girl</name>
<description>Magical girls (also known both in Japan and in the West as mahou shoujo, and in Japan as majokko) are young girls with superhuman abilities of magical nature. In the early years, magical girls usually used magic to solve everyday problems and often transformed into idols; nowadays, however, the term is most often used to refer to with girls who fight evil using magical powers, and, although transformations are still common, they tend to be more along the lines of a change of costume.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>predominantly female cast</name>
<description>A show with a predominantly female cast has mostly females as main and secondary cast members while few if any male characters have major roles. This also applies when a male lead is surrounded by females of lesser individual plot relevance, such as in a harem setting.</description>

<name>short movie</name>
<description>Typically used when an OVA only has one part and is less than the usual 20 to 25 minutes in length.
So instead of calling it a `short episode`, the `short movie` tag is more appropriate.</description>

<description>Tomoe Mami is a Puella Magi contracted to http://anidb.net/ch25645 [Kyuubee] and a third year student at Madoka`s school, living alone in a penthouse after her parents`s deaths. She has the ability to produce a near-infinite amount of flintlock rifles, can use ribbons to suspend her enemies, and is also able to perform healing magic. Due to being involved and seriously injured in a car accident (which also claimed the lives of her parents) at the time Kyuubey approached her, she was forced to use her wish to save herself. Unlike other Puella Magi, who mostly focus on obtaining valuable Grief Seeds, Mami is particularly focused on saving those around her. Though she often has a cheery disposition, she is also often lonely and scared due to the nature of her work and is pleased when Madoka offers to become her partner.

<description>Miki Sayaka is Madoka`s classmate who, after helping Madoka rescue Kyubey, ends up getting an offer to become a Puella Magi herself. She cares deeply for her friends, and wants to help an ill boy named Kyousuke Kamijou, whom she has a crush on. She becomes a Puella Magi after using her wish to cure Kyousuke`s hand, which was damaged in an accident which robbed him of his ability to play the violin. Sayaka`s weapon of choice is a sword and, like Mami, she can produce multiple swords at a time. She also has regenerative powers stronger than anyone else due to the nature of her wish. Sayaka hates people that only think of themselves at the cost of hurting others and is easily provoked into a fight.</description>

<description>A 14-year-old girl whose life changes when she encounters the Puella Magi Homura and the familiar Kyubey, who offers to transform her into a Puella Magi herself. She sees herself as a person without special qualities or talents, and after seeing Mami fighting against witches, wants to help people as a Puella Magi the same way Mami does. Madoka becomes uncertain about becoming a Puella Magi after Mami`s death in battle, though she still accompanies her friend, Sayaka, on witch hunts. She is averse to fighting and wishes that everyone would get along. She is implied to have large amount of magical potential within her, and Kyubey is particularly interested in forming a contract with her; however, she has yet to take him up on the offer.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kyuubee is a familiar who can grant any wish to a certain girl, on the condition that she become a Puella Magi and fight against witches.
When someone makes a contract with him, he extracts their soul and places it inside a Soul Gem, replacing their body with a shell that`s more resilient to fighting witches. He has so far made contracts with Mami, Kyouko and Sayaka, and shows particular interest in making Madoka a magical girl. It is yet to be revealed if there are other familiars besides him. As a magical creature, he can only be seen or heard by Puella Magis and those with magical potential. He is shown to consume used Grief Seeds, though for what reason is unknown. His true motives are unknown, and he constantly tries to find chances to persuade girls with magical potential to form a contract with him despite knowing the dangers that a Puella Magi faces. He tends to have little understanding of human values and doesn`t believe what he`s doing is cruel. If he is killed, another Kyuubee takes his place and consumes the previous one. Homura recognizes his true identity as Incubator.</description>
