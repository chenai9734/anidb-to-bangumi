<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="573698">I would have to say for fans. THe intro of the anime was VERY slow for me...one cool episode here or there; however after around episode 14 things really start to pick up and its almost like going from Über slow to beyond belief fast. The ending left many questions and misunderstandings even watching the anime myself 4 or 5 times to see if i missed anything. This anime gets a 6-10 for me only because the characters were likable and a few actions scene`s were extradinair. Plotline however gets a 1/10. Watch only if you`re a fan of the genre</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="145503">The show ain`t that bad as oppose to the reviews. Sure there are flashbacks but not to the point of unbearable. And at least it`s better than the recent moe or over the top ecchi animes (I`m so sick of them!). And to tell the truth, I`m glad they conclude the anime as such to give way for possible second season. If they rush the ending like the anime Claymore, I would be damn pissed.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="87874">awesome side character</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="404463">A classic RPG in a fantasy land with good animation and characters with depth, but as it usually happens a second season won`t happened and the anime ends inglorious forced in the last episode (see Inuyasha season 1), above average but fails to be original</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="81544">needs to be seen , suprisingly enjoyable story and character development , one of the few titles in thoes past years of the anime industry that rly refreshed my taste and mind</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="262878">It was a surprised. In the current era of moe-ness this one really intrigue me greatly. Although at first I never heard of it until I saw someone sig depicting ryner and ferris. I thought was "oh great another medieval romance"

haven`t we see many around lately, sacred blacksmith, campanela,etc...

gave a shot at 1st eps.

it was none like I though. this really renewed my faith in the current era of anime...

A must see!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="26461">I was sceptical because of the poor reviews and seemingly lame name of the anime, though this was on of those golden animes you just can`t stop watching even though you have to sleep! I like the mix of characters, animation, and imho the story is great! Not a masterpiece but certainly one that you will adore. If you like fantasy, and character development, such as you can predict somewhat and enjoy, you should watch this! :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="498732">This really surprised me. It starts slow and comical, but grows stronger and more serious with each episode. Sadly it doesn`t end, but anyone who likes fantasy and medieval-themed anime must see it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="271366">Amusing start, intriguing plotline, memorable characters, nice soundtrack, and a suspenseful inconclusive ending. Truly hoping this gets a sequel in the near future.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="441944">If you are not into brainless shounenish action and if you enjoy the fact that an anime can actually intrigue your gray cells and make you think, this is for you. It was truly a pleasant surprise, blending unexpectedly together comedy, drama, magic action and politic meddling. Give it a shot, even thought it has a huge 5 episode prelude to the real action, it`s worth it. That being said by a person that started watching it because it`s title was too terrible to be true, so yeah, it may just surprise you that nicely. :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="194504">Initially I was sceptical about this, but in the end decided to give it a try. So glad I did. Big, detailed world, rich and interesting story, likeable characters, sense of a great adventure with a few laughs along the way, some fitting and in-place tragedy, not to mention above-average animation. This really had me hooked up all the way to the end, and then some. Underrated quality work worth watching.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="282954">It is one of those where it gets better the longer you watch it. The tragedy is that once the story really starts to pick up, they end it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="503773">I was really surprised that this show turned out so enjoyable!
If you enjoy fantasy you should give it a try because its probably better then many other, similar anime! (Dont expect anything extraordinary though)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="436338">Just like some other ppl i started watching this coz name was so unimaginably unoriginal and stupid that i just had to see whats it all about and as a result i was pleasently suprised to find that this series is actualy great, great to the point where using word "legendary" in a title two times truly made sense. Great comedy with drama to match all cowered in political intrugues with big spoon of magic! Both thumbs up! Enjoy!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="361286">One of the few serious fantasy. Great and complex enough story with good characters and good political stuff. That`s enough for reason to watch it even though it`s kind of bad when it comes to humor.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="368178">One of my fav`s. The art is very well done, plot is interesting, it has awesome fights and it is full of emotion. So addictive that i watched it a second time.</recommendation>

This is a world in which many legends have been left.
In the southern parts of the continent is the Roland Empire. A country in which its people are oppressed by the decadent nobility. By command of http://anidb.net/ch17944 [King Sion], http://anidb.net/ch17942 [Ryner] and http://anidb.net/ch17943 [Ferris] are sent on a journey.
Ryner is an extremely lethargic person. All he desires is a life of peaceful indolence. However, destiny has other plans and they are soon caught up in a war. What is the future that lies before the light shining from Ryner`s "eyes"?

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<description>Feudal Warfare is the warfare of the Middle Ages and therefore the setting must take place in a time line similar to that of Middle Ages or its Asian/American counterparts, or in a fantasy world. Generally it can be described the same way as the Military category, just that the weapons used are swords, spears, bows, catapults, cannons and other weapons used in the Middle Ages.
Note: Just because the anime contains a guy or a couple of guys with swords wondering about, doesn`t make it applicable for this category, unless there are larger military organizations/groups involved in armed conflict with each other, you might not want to add this genre.</description>

<name>magic circles</name>
<description>A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised.
Traditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for non-magical work such as meditation.
Generally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>comedy</name>
<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>conspiracy</name>
<description>The conspiracy thriller (or paranoid thriller) is a sub-genre of the thriller which flourished in the 1970s in the US (and was echoed in other parts of the world) in the wake of a number of high-profile scandals and controversies (most notably Vietnam, the assassination of President Kennedy, Chappaquiddick and Watergate), and which exposed what many people regarded as the clandestine machinations and conspiracies beneath the orderly fabric of political life.
The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top".</description>

<name>social class issues</name>
<description>A character`s standing in society is cause of many issues. More generally, the society`s class structure is the source of many problems in the anime.
A common example is class division; a strong and rigid class division between rich/elite and poor/commoners, with the elites having disproportionately more privilege than the common class.
This can be applied not only when royalty and nobility are present, but also dystopian societies display often these divisions.
Another example is a division between employees and management, with employees akin to the common class, and management akin to the elite class.</description>

<description>Social commentary is the act of rebelling against an individual, or a group of people by rhetorical means. This is most often done with the idea of implementing or promoting change by informing the general populace about a given problem and appealing to people’s sense of justice. (Source: Wikipedia)&#13;

Since this is anime, usually, the mores of Japan and the Japanese society are scrutinised, but not restricted to that.</description>

For male bad guys this seems to be a must, but some of the uppity (rich) female characters use the laugh as part of their condescending attitude as well.</description>

<name>Ryner Lute</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Frequently appearing to be lethargic and unmotivated, Ryner is the protagonist of the story. He has black eyes and hair and is of slender build; is naturally talented in magic, hand-to-hand combat, arts of assassination, ancient texts, languages and symbols, and the bearer of Alpha Stigma (複写眼, アルファ・スティグマ?), an ocular ability which grants him the ability to analyse various forms of magic. Although the Alpha Stigma are the weakest and most common type of "cursed" eyes, Ryner`s eyes are no ordinary Alpha Stigmas.
Ryner is also known as "The Strongest Mage of Roland", after defeating another mage who previously held that title. He is regarded as an anomaly because he is the only person to have been able to regain his sanity after losing control of his Alpha Stigma. He is also 1/2 of the reincarnation of the legendary demon lord know as "The Lonely One".
Has a tendency to distance himself from others because he does not wish to cause harm and grief to others due to his eyes and vice versa. Has caused multiple girls throughout his life to fall in love with him, though he is reluctant to love again after his first love sacrificed herself to save him.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A blonde-hair bishoujo with blue eyes, Ferris, who comes from a famous clan of swordsmen designated to serve as guards to the King of Roland, is the heroine of the story. She carries a typically emotionless expression, is fanatic about dango (Japanese dumpling) and can do almost anything for the sake of dango.
Ferris is incredibly skilled in the sword and assigned by Sion to guard Ryner on his quest to search for the "relics of heroes". She enjoys teasing and bullying Ryner, and unconsciously gradually develops feelings for him, going into tears then into a berserk rage when she believed Ryner to be dead, attacking an opponent far superior to her with no second thoughts others than vengeance and no thought of her own well being. Her sword possesses the "ability to devour gods", which has the power to cut off the demon within Ryner, but with the price being her own life upon invocation.
She was abused as a child due her family practicing the dark tradition of incest to keep its bloodline pure. Ferris was originally suppose to marry her brother however Both Ferris and her sister were considered to be unworthy of preserving the Eris bloodline by her parents and would have been killed were not for her brother`s murdering of their parents to save Ferris`s life and forever ending the Eris`s family dark legacy.</description>

While technically, Noa was the figurehead of the rebellion against Estabul`s liege country, Roland, she was actually used by Salawel, a noble of Estabul whom she trusts. After the rebellion was suppressed by Claugh Klom and Miran Froaude, she was nearly killed by Froaude if not for Claugh`s intervention. Thereafter, she was inducted into the nobility of Roland as part of a peaceful effort to stabilize Estabul, and subsequently resides within the royal compounds of Roland. She is in a love relationship with Claugh, who is six years older, and constantly worries about his well-being as he has a tendency to overdo things.</description>

<name>Sui Orla</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A tall lanky guy with peach coloured hair with a comb attached to his hair, Sui is Kuu`s elder brother and frequently travels together with Kuu. He is a young aspiring author with a seemingly friendly personality. However, underlying, he carries a strength and power beyond that of a normal human being. He possesses the Rule Fragment known as "The Comb of Elemio". The artefact is shaped like a comb and can be used to fire a powerful shockwave against the enemy, and is said to be an ideal weapon to counteract a berserk Alpha Stigma bearer`s pentagram-shaped deconstruction power. In the anime, instead of firing a shockwave, it appears to emit an anti-magic forcefield. He also picked up the Rule Fragment that Ryner discarded after accidentally summoning a dragon from it. This Rule Fragment, "Blade of Dolueli", is in the form of a dagger with a blue blade, and upon invocation by stabbing the sword into something, grants the invoker the power to call forth flames, which varies depending on the user and his will. In Sui`s case, it took the form of a dragon encompassing his whole arm. The only anomaly was that, Ryner summoned a dragon the first time he misused it.
Like Refal and Ril, Sui is an expert in the subject on "Cursed Eyes" and has a "hobby" of killing "Cursed Eye" bearers, crystallizing their eyes and adding them to his collection, which were later utilized as weapons by the Gastark Empire. In his second encounter with Ryner and Ferris, he forced Ryner into berserking, without realizing that Ryner`s Alpha Stigma is not any other Alpha Stigma, and was seriously wounded by the berserk Ryner, losing his hand and the "Comb of Elemio" in the process, before being whisked away by Kuu`s inhuman speed. Later he was fatally wounded by Frouade in another battle, and would have been finished off if not for Ferris`s interception, before being carried away again by Kuu. Eventually, during the battle with Geihlficlant, he was tasked by Refal to retrieve Kiefer, which led him to another fight with Ryner, who was eventually apparently "slain" by Ril. During that battle, he wields a new Rule Fragment that looks like the Blade of Dolueli, except that it has a red blade rather than a blue one.</description>

<description>A fourteen year old girl with long peach coloured hair, Kuu is the youngest of the Orla family and is often seen wearing a completely black dress. While she has a bishoujo appearance, she carries a wicked tongue, and appears to be more mature than Sui, often complaining that she has to look after him, and may never to be able to become a bride because of this. Like her brother Sui, she wields a Rule Fragme known as "The Scythe of Ailuchrono". The artefact is in the shape of a large scythe, and rapidly increases the wielder`s strength and speed, allowing Kuu to easily match up to Ferris`s speed. The blade also has the ability to freeze anyone who comes into contact with it, and Kuu manages to use this ability to stop Sui from bleeding to death. As a side effect, the artefact "freezes" the wielder`s heart as well and Kuu will lose all her emotional capacity when she`s wielding it.</description>

<description>Kuku, an orphan, is the childhood friend of Arua. She was the first person to be willing to talk to Ryner and Ferris when all the villagers were running away from them. After Arua was saved by Ryner, Sui and Kuu abducted Kuku and lie in wait for Arua in an attempt to crystallise his eyes, without knowing that Ryner and Ferris were the rescuers. She was almost killed as a hostage by Sui if not for the intervention of Froaude. Thereafter, together with Arua, she defected to Roland and lived in the Eris mansion.
As Arua has promised to protect her for life, she sees herself as the fiancee of Arua despite her age. Later, she then travels together with Arua, and Ryner`s company with the Anti-Roland Coalition.</description>

<description>Arua is a six year old boy when he debuted in the story, with black hair and black eyes, Arua is an Alpha Stigma bearer from Runa Empire. Runa, a religious empire, branded him as a monster, and captured him for experimentation. He witnessed his parents being killed in front of his own eyes, and almost went berserk if not for Ryner. After being saved by Ryner and Ferris, he learned magic from Ryner and trained his physical body under the tutelage of Ferris, all this to save Kuku from the Orla siblings. Thus he sees himself as their disciple. Ryner remarked that even the most talented magic user would require at least a year before he is able to see the particles of light that are used for magic. But for an Alpha Stigma bearer, this becomes an inborn ability, thus enabling Arua to start learning spells immediately.
After saving Kuku, together with Kuku and Iris, he defected to Roland and lived in the Eris mansion. Later, after Ryner and Ferris escaped, together with Kuku and Iris, he joined up with Ryner`s company. When Ryner and Ferris were blitzing Roland`s camp, Arua assisted them and displayed his ingenuity by blending in Roland`s magic with Nelpha magic to launch a surprise ranged magical attack. In the Legend of the Great Lengendary Heroes, there was an inconsistency in plot in which Arua was said to be from Nelpha.</description>

He like Sion dislike the idea of waging war, and tries to reduce casualities as much as possible, as he believes there is no other way to prevent war, than waging war itself. He eventually meets Kiefer, in a battle against Stohl, and shows a liking for her, after she tried to protect two defenseless children, and eventually invites her to his side, to which she declines for the moment. He possesses the Rule Fragment known as Glouvil, which is a large one bladed sword, which upon sacrificing something, grants him great destructive powers that can easily surpass those of a large-scale spell. So far he has sacrificed his right leg, sense of smell, and his left eye for this.</description>

<description>The eldest of the Orla family, Ril has short peach colored hair and a cool and calm disposition. He wields the Rule Fragment, "The Ring of Thunder Beasts (來獣の指輪)", allowing him to summon magical beasts of light. The Ring is said to be on the same level of power as Froaude`s "Ring of the Dark Emperor". He also possesses the Rule Fragment, "Rock Devourer (石喰い, スパンクエル, Supan Kueru)". In addition to that, he possesses a number of crystallized "Cursed Eyes" which he can invoke as weapons. Ril also appears to be knowledgeable in Cursed Eyes and Rule Fragme. When he first fought Froaude, he was demonstrated to be a quick-witted and cunning opponent, and almost killed Froaude if not for the timely arrival of Claugh. Unlike his siblings, he operates alone and carries out infiltration and assassination missions for the Gastark Empire. Later, during the battle with Geihlficlant, as Ryner was covering for Ferris, he took advantage of an opening and stole Ryner`s Alpha Stigma. Thinking that Ryner`s death was imminent, as to a Cursed Eye bearer, the eyes are as important an organ as the brain or the heart, he left the battlefield together with his siblings without realizing what he did was part of Voice`s plan in triggering off Ryner`s complete awakening.</description>

He has a past with Claugh Klom. He spares Claugh`s life prior to the events of the story by injuring a part of Claugh`s arm but not killing him. The latter to uses magic to save it.
The two fight again later on and Tiia easily defeats Clough, who loses his Crimson arm in the process. Claugh later uses forbidden cursed magic to regain it in a changed black form. Tiia`s motives are unknown, but as he has a problem to control his power, he may not have a motive or loyalty for his doings at all. His eyes have Ino Dwoe`s power and when the power manifests, a cross-shaped symbol appears over the pupils of the bearers, allowing them to absorb magical energy and increase their powers.
Despite his inhuman actions, Tiia has been shown to have a kind, polite, and even compassionate side towards others, especially those he deems as monsters.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Formerly Duke Lieutolu of Roland, Lieral is the father of Ryner (Feruna Lieutolu). The House of Lieutolu, also called the "Overseer of Magic House Lieutolu", was a major Noble House of Roland, and had a standing matching up to that of the Eris House. Lieral is a genius who created much of the fundamentals of Roland`s magic today, and he manages a number of scholars and academics in wizardry to further the advancement of magic. Lieral`s flesh body has been infused and permeated with magical energy and like Lucile, he has an ethereal body which made him immune to any form of physical attack. He can alter his physical appearance to assume any age, create simulacrums and projections of himself, and is well versed in various of forms of magic inscriptions and incantations, making him so formidable and powerful that Ferris`s strength and movements are like child`s play to him. However, because his body is almost completely made up of magic, his natural bane are the bearers of the Iino Dwooe. When Iino Dwooe`s power is invoked by its bearer, a cross-shaped symbol appears over their pupils, allowing the bearer to absorb magical energy to increase their powers.
Since young, Lieral has no interest in anything but magic. However, due to a stroke of coincidence, he bumped into a village girl, Iluna Laswhale, and fell in love at first sight. Subsequently, they were married despite the objections from both families. When he discovered his newly born son was born with the Alpha Stigma, he immersed himself deeply into the research in magic to save Feruna from the doomed fate of an Alpha Stigma bearer. Consequently, he split "The Lonely Demon" into two parts, placing the "Lonely" fragment into Feruna, and the "God Devouring" incantation into the head of Rex Eris. Furthermore, in order to protect Ryner from "α", the Curse of "The Goddess" for erasing "The Solver of All Equations", he infused Iluna`s body with magic, and implanted the resulting spiritual existence, "The Charm of Aatofaaru, into Ryner. Furthermore, he first tested the feelings of Ferris for Ryner before affixing the "God Devouring" talisman to her sword.
Due to Lieral`s action of splitting and implanting the Lonely Portion into Feruna`s body, he is deem a traitor and has an issued order of assassination by the "The Mad Hero". He is also hunted by Tiir of the God`s Eyes group as their leader, Enne Lune, states that Lieral will destroy the world.</description>

<description>Maiden name Iluna Laswhale. Formerly a village girl who fell in love with Lieral Lieutolu and later marries him. She eventually gives birth to Feruna Lieutolu (Ryner Lute). When Feruna is discovered to be a bearer of Alpha Stigma, she becomes very depressed blaming herself for falling in love with Lieral who is of high birth. She even attempted a murder and suicide but was stopped by Lieral. She died after having her soul sacrificed during Feruna/Ryner`s first awakening.
Despite being dead, she lives inside Ryner as "The Charm of Artofaal". When Ryner was stabbed by Lieral, Ryner enters his inner world and meets Iluna. They spent mother and son time as Iluna looks on how much Ryner has grown before being devoured by Alpha after telling Ryner the method of escaping Alpha.</description>
