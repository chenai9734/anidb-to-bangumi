<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>comedy</name>
<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>Kitarou</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kitarou is a youkai boy born in a cemetery, and aside from his mostly-decayed father, the last living member of the Ghost Tribe (幽霊族, yuurei zoku). He is missing his left eye, but his hair usually covers the empty socket. He fights for peace between humans and youkai, which generally involves protecting the former from the wiles of the latter. When questioned in the 2007 movie, Kitarou responds that he is three hundred and fifty years old.
Kitarou has an assortment of strange weapons at his disposal, including:
* * remote-controlled geta sandals

* * a detachable hand, also remote-controlled

* * a magic chanchanko vest which can protect its wearer from danger; it occasionally seems to act of its own accord, wrapping around enemies or aiding friends, even when Kitaro is not available to command it

* * spiny hairs which can be shot like arrows

* * another hair which can serve as an antenna for detecting spirit activity

* * a magical ocarina (usually used for calling Ittan Momen), which contains a baton, a whip and occasionally music which has the power to damage certain ghosts.

* * the power of electrocution, usually employed when an enemy has pinned or restrained him and he can no longer kick or use other weapons

<name>Nezumi Otoko</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Nezumi Otoko is a rodent-like youkai-human halfbreed. He has been alive for three hundred and sixty years, and in that time has almost never taken a bath, rendering him filthy, foul-smelling, and covered in welts and sores. While he is usually Kitarou`s friend, Nezumi Otoko will waste no time cooking up vile schemes or betraying his companions if he thinks there`s money to be had or a powerful enemy to side with. He claims to be a college graduate of the University of the Bizarre (怪奇大学, Kaiki Daigaku).
Nezumi-Otoko first appears in the story The Lodging House (Rental manga version) as Dracula IV`s minion.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Neko Musume is a normally-quiet youkai girl, who transforms into a frightening cat monster with fangs and feline eyes when she is angry or hungry for fish. Predictably, she does not get along well with Nezumi Otoko. She seems to harbor a slight crush on Kitaro, who sees her only as a friend. She bears some resemblance to the bakeneko of Japanese folklore.
Neko-Musume first appears in the story Neko-Musume and Nezumi-Otoko (Weekly Shounen Magazine version), however another cat-girl named Neko (寝子) appears in the earlier stories The Vampire Tree and the Neko-Musume and A Walk to Hell (Rental version).</description>

<description>Konaki Jijii is a comic, absent-minded old youkai man who attacks enemies by clinging to them and turning himself to stone, increasing his weight and mass immensely and pinning them down. He and Sunakake Babaa often work as a team. The original konaki jijii is a ghost which is said to appear in the woods of Tokushima Prefecture in the form of a crying infant. When it is picked up by some hapless traveller, it increases its weight until it crushes him.
