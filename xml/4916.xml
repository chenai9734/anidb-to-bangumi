<description>A remake of Giant Robo, to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the tokusatsu, anime and manga series created by Yokoyama Mitsuteru.
That magnificent iron figure has come back with brand new look!
With the original author Mr.Mitsuteru Yokoyama`s last wish on their mind, the giant robots strike each other using all their strength!
Forty years ago when Japanese people were into monster movies, there was a Robot cartoon that fascinated many children. The name of the cartoon is "GIANT ROBO" written by Mr. Mitsuteru Yokoyama.
As soon as the cartoon started to appear serially in a magazine "Weekly Shonen Sunday (published by Shougakukan)" from May 1967 it gained wide popularity. Half years later it was made into TV live action drama using special effects which also made a big hit. In 1992 the original video animation "GIANT ROBO the animation the day the earth stood still" was released.
Now it is 2007- new century has come and many people are waiting for the revival of Giant Robo, the monumental work in the field of robot animation genre which is still remembered by a lot of people as if Giant Robo eternally remembered Daisaku Kusama with the voice recognition.
To leave this name in people`s mind forever, the new animated version "GIANT ROBO" will launch!
The image of Giant Robo for the new era
What are the features and purpose of releasing the "ultimate version" of Giant Robo?
It is about facing the reality of the 21st century, regenerating the core parts of the original story, and introducing it to the audiences of the new generation as the animated super entertainment.
Next will be introduction of the specific steps and developments of this project.
Dedicated to the memory of Mr.Mitsuteru Yokoyama.
The time is 20XX.
Mysterious huge robots called "Giant Robo (GR)" started to appear all over the world and destroy cities. The earth was covered with fear. And their next target is Japan! The hero of this animation Daisaku Kusama, who works in a diving shop, encounters a mysterious girl, simply called V who leads him to make a contract with an enormous robot "Giant Robo 1 (GR1)" at the ancient ruins (Minami Yonaguni Island) in Okinawa.
He made a contract with UNISOM (good guys) and was approved to be a commander of GR1. Thus his battle has begun against GRO (bad guys) and creates a lot of dramas. Before long, Giant Robo of the 21st century will ask the world the true meaning of its power.</description>

<name>journalist</name>
<description>A journalist is a person who collects, writes, or distributes news or other current information to the public. A journalist`s work is called journalism. A journalist can work with general issues or specialize in certain issues; however, most journalists tend to specialize. For example, a sports journalist covers news within the world of sports, but this journalist may be a part of a news organization that covers many different topics.
A reporter is a type of journalist who researches, writes, and reports on information in order to present in sources, conduct interviews, engage in research, and make reports. Reporters may split their time between working in a newsroom and going out to witness events or interviewing people. Reporters may be assigned a specific beat or area of coverage.

<description>A robot is an automatically guided machine, able to do tasks on its own. Another common characteristic is that by its appearance or movements, a robot often conveys a sense that it has intent or agency of its own.
Not to be confused with android (human-like robot).</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>island</name>
<description>Part of this anime takes place on an island, a small landmass that is surrounded by the sea. Generally, an island setting involves interaction with "island" elements. Such elements could include (but is not limited towards): riding on a boat, fishing, foraging/hunting, beach scene, "peaceful island life", being "shipwrecked", island fever, lamenting isolation from the mainland, etc.
An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, cays or keys. An island in a river or lake may be called an eyot (also ait), or holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago.

<description>Literally translating to giant monster, daikaiju is an element found often in Japanese entertainment.

Any monster that towers over a house technically qualifies as a daikaiju. Some anime, usually mecha, will go as far as calling their daikaiju with a specific title.</description>
