<description>Tomorrow is a very rare day, the day of a total solar eclipse. If we miss this chance, there won`t be another eclipse visible in Alola for over 300 years. Hearing of this eclipse, http://anidb.net/ch6693 [Satoshi] and his pals, along with http://anidb.net/ch87023 [Maamane], head to Eclipse Island which is in the center of the eclipse`s path! There, they meet Fred, an "Eclipse Hunter" who travels the world to see eclipses, and they decide to watch the eclipse together with him. However, when the day arrives, the sky is filled with clouds... Satoshi and his pals realize that they`ll be able to watch the eclipse for sure if they`re above the clouds, so they head to the summit of a mountain. Meanwhile, the http://anidb.net/ch1925 [Rocket-dan] trio has also sneaked out of http://anidb.net/ch87029 [Kiteguruma]`s den to catch a rare Pokémon said to appear during eclipses. They decide to try and catch http://anidb.net/ch8091 [Pikachu] as well and block the way of Satoshi and his pals as they try to hurry to the summit! While everyone is busy, the eclipse has already started! Will Satoshi and his pals be able to watch the eclipse?!
With your Full-Force, don`t miss it! The "Moment of Wonder" performed by the Sun and Moon!
