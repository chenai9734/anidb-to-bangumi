<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="420432">Master Piece...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="78194">It`s a good anime, but I must say that it tried too hard to present its theme. Considering the large cast, it`s amazing that ALL of them are quite unlikable and down right irritating. Before watching I should warn you, this isn`t an anime of humans vs Vampires; it`s about two different types of monsters fighting each other.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="166705">Starts slow, goes high up just before series hit the half mark. Until that the intrigue, mistery and horror are apparent. Then it ends too soon with a quick escape mechanic "kill everything". Horror disappears as the antagonists suddenly become light hearted, mystery is broken just in time but it feels like half way they just had to finish it. One way or another. Ok anime overall. Not a best watch tho</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="190817">If you want to see vampires cry over their food, this is for you.  
Shiki starts great, but losts it`s credibility for me when a former friend cries because he has to attack Natsumo. If you want your vampires mean and soulless, then this will go downhill for you.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="343122">If you dont like vampire anime, watch it at least because of music :) Masterpiece</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="139195">Food for thought. Not your usual vampire themed anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="173054">This is a great horror-themed vampire series that isn`t afraid to be brutal.  It`s truly a shame they make the humans look like the monsters considering the vampires are WAY worse [they instigated EVERYTHING]. That was my one big pet peeve. Otherwise, this was easily one of the better vampire anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="122157">Who is good and who is bad, is the constant struggle in this plot. Who is the monster? Who is really living and who are not? These are the questions that underlines the basis of this storyline. Not so suited for those who are just for adventure and action.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="217946">It is a conventional vampire-story. The vampire`s attributes follows the folklore. Lot of twists. The show advancing rather slowly, ends a little fast.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="172963">It`s very dark, at times depressingly so.

Also it`s fascinating to see how normal people, under pressure, become monsters themselves.

I recommend this for it`s story, there are no fillers, and it`s at times nerve wrecking, though the art style might not be for everyone. And be advised, this is bloody. Some death scenes are very disturbing.

Also there are two extra episodes, include them into the show! They are amazing and show something happening in the series from a different perspective (your everyday side character).</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="417666">A good anime which is very successful with it`s disturbingly dark stressing atmosphere. I recommend, it`s a nice watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="274914">The line between good and bad is blurred in this story. It brings out the dark side of man as he single-mindedly pursues his own self-interest. There is a gradual and cleverly engineered transition between the protagonist and the antagonist roles as the anime progresses, thus focus is spread over a multitude of characters instead of a single apparent `lead`. The ending suggests an upcoming second season, hopefully. Recommended for anyone who would like something deep to mull over.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="455687">AWESOME, GLORIOUS,
4 any 1 who loves Vampire/Horror genre.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="249260">A very well-paced anime where humans aren`t the good guys, for once. It properly shows motivations and atrocities from both sides and manages to remain quite surprising.

My one true gripe, however, is that the possibility of `coexistence` is glossed over and improperly considered. Simply stating it is impossible just doesn`t cut it, ESPECIALLY when none of the obvious and implied signs show that coexistence is, in fact, impossible. to the contrary.

Still, a series well-recommended.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="177218">Absolutely great story &amp; suspense horror (Vampire) anime IMO. 100% recommendation to watch this! Well hope there`s a 2nd season (cross fingers), otherwise its a good ending tho for now ~</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="503773">This is not your typical good vs. bad type of story and actually makes you wonder, who the greater monster is.
Definitely worth giving it a try!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="262593">One of those shows you can`t say much about without spoiling some of the suspense it has. A great horror show which continues to explore some of humanities darker trairts.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="148832">I`m sorry but I didn`t like it sorry I wouldn`t recommended.  I think that the peoples in this story is too stupid which make the show suck to me.  It`s like they can`t even think.  This is really disappointing for me.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="194589">For fans of dark/violent anime, especially if you like vampires. The show had the potential to be better, but didn`t live up to it. I think the over-saturation of characters ended up hurting the show rather than helping it. However, it`s still a good watch, and the vampires actually get something done here.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="455302">Well made anime with good story. Quite big character lineup with good coverage to their story. Lot of angst. I felt like the show`s sympathetic focus shifted in the end, but nice watch anyways. Lots of blood gore in the ending episodes. Would have liked better animation quality though.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="209575">From the same author of the "Evil spirit series" made into the series "Ghost Hunt",

Shi-ki offers a violent, detailed and well-woven portray of mass psychosis as it develops in an isolated mountain community which offers a rosary of credibly heterogeneous characters and their varied reactions to the extreme against a ridiculous literary premise but with serious, pessimistic realism and a taste of the supernatural.

It explores how reasonable, acceptable each short, humble step towards the limits of dignity and sanity can be seen as. And then, given enough momentum, how close to outright sadistic brutality can develop. The author deliberatly refrains from much bias leaving the readers free to feel irritated or admired with whoever they want.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="224642">Definetly a must see for horror/mystery fans.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="260880">A "piece of gold" for vampire funs..</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="443546">Animation isn`t bad, it`s rather unusual, when you get used to it is quite good. But, even if you consider animation to be bad, it is still worth to watch; plot will rectify animation. Though, the first part of the anime is little slow.
Definitely must see for those who like horror genre, nevertheless recommended for all the others.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="9461">Detailed, coherent, and comprehensible development of characters and story. Often doesen`t take the easy way out. A very gripping experience.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="444838">Stephanie Meyer: THIS is how you make a vampire tale!

Harrowing, brutal, copious amounts of blood. It really made my skin crawl from sheer Schadenfreude overdose. The most sadistic show since Higurashi.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="326975">A really good mystery anime, and propably my favorite anime overall this year. Great story and characters, rather good character development and nice cliffhangers that make you want to watch the next episode right away. The start might be a little slow for some people though, but it totally worth it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="410747">It`s cool</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="564210">Hunderte Animee  gesehen und doch..., mich bewegt wie dieser haben nicht einmal eine Handvoll. Herzzerreißend, einzigartig und krass wie dieses Stück Kunstwerk ist, so brennt es auch in einem nach. Soviel Konflikt und Reiz muss man aber auch verdauen können. Es gebe mehr zu sagen, doch seht einfach selbst! Kaufen!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="472606">One of the most awesome anime out there .. Plot, animation, music, very very good. a must see worth repeating every year !!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="411316">There is no Good or Evil side in this anime, it`s all a matter of perspective. The antagonists and protagonists keep switching back and forth, making this into an anime which focuses on almost every character involved instead of a few select ones. 
A must see for anyone who appreciates deep stories where there is no clear border between good and evil. Be prepared, it`s a great story, together with interesting animations and good voice acting, but the thoughts this story is based upon, are incredibly dark. Don`t expect a happy "lovey-dovey" ending.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="599558">This anime is a masterpiece guys. go and watch it right now. awesome pace. awesome story. awesome characters...music...ending...everthing.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="728642">Seriously - watch this. Its amazing. I usually don`t like vampire themed stories but this is different...perfection. Seriously - you won`t regret this!!</recommendation>

<description>* Based on http://anidb.net/cr1214 [Ono Fuyumi]`s novel and http://anidb.net/cr13869 [Fujisaki Ryuu]`s manga adaption.
Sotoba is a small village with around 1300 inhabitants. It is not connected even to a single highway. In that isolated village, some old customs, such as the burial of the dead, are still practised.
One day, the corpses of three people are found. Although http://anidb.net/ch15637 [Ozaki Toshio], the village`s lone doctor, feels uncertain, he treats the deaths as normal occurrences. However, in the days following, the villagers die one after the other.
Is this mere coincidence, an epidemic, or something else entirely?

<name>insane</name>
<description>Insanity, craziness, or madness is a spectrum of behaviors characterized by certain abnormal mental or behavioral patterns. Insanity may manifest as violations of societal norms, including a person becoming a danger to themselves or others, though not all such acts are considered insanity; likewise, not all acts showing indifference toward societal norms are acts of insanity.
In modern usage, insanity is most commonly encountered as an informal unscientific term denoting mental instability, or in the narrow legal context of the insanity defense.
A more informal use of the term insanity is to denote something or someone considered highly unique, passionate or extreme, including in a positive sense. The term may also be used as an attempt to discredit or criticise particular ideas, beliefs, principles, desires, personal feelings, attitudes, or their proponents, such as in politics and religion.

<name>vampire</name>
<description>A vampire is a mythological or folkloric nocturnal undead. Vampires use long fangs to penetrate the necks of people, usually young females, to drink their blood, both as a form of nourishment and to turn the targets into slaves.
In the classic vampire stories, they are thought to have no reflection in mirrors, are able to shapeshift into bats (sometimes also wolves or some form of fog), have unlimited lifespan and superhuman strength, reflexes and senses, and may only be killed by silver bullets, silver blades, a stake through the heart, fire, or exposure to sunlight; on the other hand, they cannot tolerate garlic, holy water, or Christian crosses (sometimes expanded to religious symbols in general).
In modern anime, these limitations are usually dropped, and they become far more powerful and fearsome opponents than usual. A human bitten, or sometimes even scratched, by a vampire typically becomes a slave, eventually dying as if poisoned, and becoming a vampire, ghoul, zombie, or other form of undead after death, often staying under the command of the vampire who originally bit them.</description>

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<description>noitaminA (ノイタミナ) – Animation written backwards – is a Fuji Television programming block, devoted to anime, broadcast each Thursday night from 00:45 to 1:15. It was launched with the intention of expanding the target audience beyond the typical young male demographic.
The timeslot was expanded from half an hour to a full hour in 2010, and now airs Thursday nights from 00:45 to 1:45.
noitaminA aired its first non-anime series in 2010, with the premiere of the live-action adaptation of Moyashimon. On April 15, 2010, Fuji TV and FUNimation announced an agreement that allows FUNimation to simulcast series from the noitaminA block in North America within an hour of their airing in Japan.</description>

<description>Usually metaphorical. Sometimes literal. At times both!
Typically this refers to the fact that the story is set in a grim, dog eat dog milieu — for example a decaying city.
Often the characters are just doing what they need to do to survive, with little or no expectation that their lives can be better. And often characters may feel they do not have any real choice in what they do.
And yes, occasionally the setting is actually dark — be it night or perpetually heavy cloudy sky and rain. It all adds to the oppressive, hopeless feeling of the show.

<name>gore</name>
<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<name>ensemble cast</name>
<description>A show with an ensemble cast focuses on a larger group of main characters in a single plot narrative; anime containing several segmented plot narratives (such as episodic or arc-based plots) are excluded. As such, it doesn`t really have a "main" or "lead" character; instead, every member of the central main character group plays an important part in the show`s grander scheme; no single character is more important or prominent than the others (equality of importance). Further, subplots (if any) lead by each character in the ensemble have equal weighting in importance (or lack of weight).

* In a show where no single main character is more important or prominent than the others, 4+ main characters is almost always an ensemble cast.
* A show with 3 main characters of equal importance is likely also an ensemble cast; equality of importance must be considered carefully.
* A show with 2 main characters of equal importance is generally not an ensemble cast situation; however, on an exception basis where neither main character is considered an antagonist, a 2-main-character anime may be considered an ensemble (e.g. http://anidb.net/a11829 [Kimi no Na wa.]).

<description>Somewhere down the line, it became the "norm" that boys don`t cry. The scenario does not matter; shedding tears is the ultimate no-no in terms of what you can and cannot do as a man (at least in the West, anyway). But there comes a time when a man`s emotions do get the better of him, and they pour forth - as prerequisite an impassioned speech may or may not be present - by cascading down his cheeks. These are what we like to call "manly tears". Extremely powerful. Not limited but often used in hot-blooded / super robot shows. Examples include Yuusha Ou GaoGaiGar, Getter Robo and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.
The opposite of manly tears are "girly tears".</description>

<name>i got a crush on you</name>
<description>It happens when a person develops an interest in someone that seems mysterious, smart, sexy, cute, fun, etc. Basically just someone you would like to spend more time with. Crushes are usually one sided and they happen more frequently among middle and high school students.
A person with a crush usually has a hard time expressing or conveying his/her feelings to that other person. That other person is usually clueless of the situation. Sometimes that person knows about the crush, but feels annoyed or embarrassed by it for some reason.
Having a crush on someone does not mean you are in love with that person, at least not yet. Depending on the situation crushes could develop differently (for better or worse):
1) Larger scale interactions (love).
2) Dating relationships.
3) Scary obsession or stalker type situations.
4) Disappear over time or distance.</description>
