<description>It is the latter half of Universal Century 0096 and the Earth Federation government feel threatened by the existence of the "Psycho Frame." First lieutenant http://anidb.net/ch89264 [Mehmet Merka], a member of the intelligence bureau under their jurisdiction, forms a special force called "Mastima" and is given an important mission to infiltrate and investigate the severed "Axis," an asteroid that drifts near the Earth Sphere. There are two civilians by the name of http://anidb.net/ch88455 [Arlette Almage] and http://anidb.net/ch88456 [Danton Hyleg], both of whom were once an engineer and test pilot respectively for the Principality of Zeon and Neo Zeon, who accompany Mehmet as members of the investigation team. When the investigation team infiltrate Axis, they are assaulted by the private army "Barnum`s" new type Gundams despite the base being thought to be abandoned. Although they fight back with the red "Zaku III Custom," a mobile suit that Danton and Arlette were both once involved with, they confront various critical situations.
Amidst all this, Arlette keeps certain "feelings" hidden away in her heart and is faced with the wreckage of the Sazabi that was left behind on the surface of Axis...

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<description>Short episodes are regular episodes that are much shorter than the standard length. This means up to and including 10 minutes; shows with episodes that are 11 to 20 minutes in length are http://anidb.net/t6494 [half-length episodes] instead.
Not to be confused with http://anidb.net/t6349 [multi-segment episodes], which are regular episodes that are split into several short segments (parts), usually with separate titles and independent storylines.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Known as the "Red Comet" for his high-speed attack tactics, Char is the most famous of Zeon`s ace mobile suit pilots. He earned his nickname by destroying five Federation battleships during the Battle of Loum, and after the attack on Side 7, he becomes the dreaded nemesis of the White Base crew. However, defeating the Federation isn`t the only thing on Char`s mind, and his distinctive mask hides the face of a young man bent on his own personal quest for revenge. As the story continues, Char begins putting his own complicated schemes into motion, even as he becomes distracted by his growing rivalry with the Gundam`s pilot.

<description>This young woman is a test subject of the Flanagan Institute, a Zeon research organization created to investigate the gifted humans known as "newtypes." While the exploits of pilots like Char and Amuro have led to speculation that they may be newtypes, Lalah`s powers are obvious and undeniable, and accompanied by a profound spiritual awareness. However, despite her gentle nature, Lalah is fiercely loyal to the man who saved her life - Char Aznable, the scheming "Red Comet."</description>

<description>Although the AMX-011 Zaku III design loses out to the AMX-014 Dooben-Wolf as Neo Zeon`s intended new frontline mass production mobile suit, several Zaku III prototypes are produced. These Zaku IIIs prove quite popular with many Neo Zeon officers and ace pilots fighting in the First Neo Zeon War. One Zaku III unit ends up in the hands of Haman Karn loyalist Mashymre Cello, who employs his customized Zaku III in one of the last battles of the war. Although Mashymre`s Zaku III is referred to as the AMX-011S Zaku III Custom, it`s indeed nothing more than the basic Zaku III loaded out with various optional equipment selected by Mashymre. His Zaku III Custom sports heavier and more stylized armor, a new head mounting a pair of vulcan guns, optional left shoulder armor with a hide bomb dispenser, a large backpack with powerful thrusters and ejectable external propellant tanks, and an enormous rear skirt armor plate.

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>One of many new prototype mobile suits developed by Neo Zeon during the First Neo Zeon War, the AMX-104 R-Jarja`s form is inspired by the old Principality of Zeon`s YMS-15 Gyan from the One Year War. Like the Gyan, the R-Jarja is designed primarily for melee combat, and is armed with a large hand-carried beam sword and a removable heat saber mounted like a bayonet on its beam rifle. Two sets of missile launchers in the shoulders round out its armament, but the R-Jarja features a rather unique defensive feature. This feature is the pair of "flexible shields" mounted on its shoulders, which can be flipped to provide additional armor protection to either the front or rear of the R-Jarja. Initially a single prototype that is intended for later mass production, the R-Jarja never makes it past the experimental stage, with one completed unit operated by ace pilot Chara Soon.
