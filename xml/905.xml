<description>A Saiyan warrior has arrived on Earth. His name is http://anidb.net/ch55685 [Paragus] and he seeks the rightful ruler of the Saiyans, http://anidb.net/ch2105 [Vegeta]! Confessing his loyalty to his new king, Paragus pleads with the powerful warrior to vanquish a rampaging Super Saiyan who is threatening to destroy the entire galaxy!
But when http://anidb.net/ch11407 [King Kai] learns of the Super Saiyan threat he begs http://anidb.net/ch2103 [Goku] to rush to the scene of the action to take care of the problem himself. Sparks will fly as Goku and Vegeta clash over who is to be the one to confront the galaxy`s new menace.
However, the mysterious Paragus is not what he seems. What information does he have about Goku and Vegeta`s past? With Paragus` volatile son http://anidb.net/ch42921 [Broly] on the scene, the Saiyan power struggle reaches new levels of excitement and danger. Broly has his own agenda, and his target is the most powerful Saiyan in the Universe! But will it be Goku or Vegeta?!</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>elements</name>
<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>Action anime usually involve a fairly straightforward story of good guys versus bad guys, where most disputes are resolved by using physical force. It often contains a lot of shooting, explosions and fighting.</description>

<name>henshin</name>
<description>Japanese for "transformation" (metamorphosis or disguise).
A "henshin anime" is any anime, where the characters or their costumes transform, such as Sailor Moon. The henshin switches on the character`s special powers, and is frequently accompanied by a costume change. Often the change of clothing is the only outward indicator that the character has changed and yet nobody seems to notice the hero`s true self.
Most henshin heroes have a special item which they use to change into their heroic form. These items are usually activated by a command phrase (which is often in Engrish, for some reason), triggering a transformation sequence.</description>

<name>Broly</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Broly the original and Legendary Super Saiyan. He is born with a power level of ten thousand, a power greater than most elite Saiyan warriors, and he is mentally unsettled as an adult, partially due to the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, and partially because his power was so extreme. He eventually becomes the "Legendary Super Saiyan" and his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, and Future Trunks as well as Piccolo before killing his father. He is eventually defeated, but he manages to make his way into an escape pod. He later lands on Earth and goes into a frozen state until the crying of Goten awakens him. He is killed by Goku, Gohan and Goten, though blood samples make their way into the hands of an industrialist, who creates a clone called Bio-Broly. The clone eventually wakes up and becomes mixed with bio-liquid, transforming him into Bio-Broly. He is eventually killed by Goten, Trunks, and Krillin.
