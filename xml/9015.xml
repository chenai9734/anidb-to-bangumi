<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="478937">It`s interesting, that`s a fact. Despite the mediocre story, it has a refreshing male lead and lots of fan service. Moreover, this one has the of potential for story development like the past maybe or its continuation (though maybe it was already part of the novel). I would not mind watching a second season.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="228848">Breakdown:

Want hot girl on girl action? Watch episode 2. 

Interested in the story? Finish it. 

Main character is a boss.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="305778">for fans of action,fantasy &amp; awesome MALE protagonists  the only thing that would make you complain if LARGE breasts aren`t your fetish appeal

hope things keep getting better....... I hope so .... really</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="433695">underrated. this is definitely a must watch in this season, after finishing this and a few more anime i realized this is like one of the better ones, despite the fighting scenes wasn`t as awesome some other series, but the storyline is good</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="304100">I say recommended for most. However, for those who are sick and tired of whiny, indecisive main character it`s a must see. There is lots of ecchi, however it`s not so bad as to be the base of the entire plot, and is mostly humorous in nature.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="561206">I have to say I was positively surprised by the not so weak main character of this anime. However, that being said, the story didn`t feel all that good but the anime was still worth watching.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="496570">I really recomend this to all those who don´t mind ecchi. This is exactly what one can want from this genre. Good plot, humour, interesting main hero and even the females aren´t half bad.
The only con is that some people doesen´t like heroins with cups somwhere around Z(it definitely isn´t D or F)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="530122">Really underrated, finally a harem where the main  character kinda deserves it...
Seriously at least a 6</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="460550">Even if you are already getting bored from this genre, this one may be worth your time, if anything, for the unusual male lead character.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="308191">Funny and engaging, for an echi/fantasy type anime it was pretty good.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="556152">rly good.. hoping for a second season</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="348518">I`d say it`s a must see. Good character development; I especially enjoyed the main character. Lataely I`ve seen so many wishy-washy main characters that it was really refreshing this one.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="38231">Absolutely fantastic!! This male protagonist ist just how way more male ones should be. He`s cool, a bit mysterious, not utterly shy when it comes to ecchi stuff. I totally love it and a clear recommendation!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="331255">Bored with a male protagonist that all weak looking and always have to be helped with the female protagonist? then this is for you. Cool story, good development</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="625155">The main character was a beast. The guy was the ideal protagonist, and he`s the main reason that this anime shone so bright. A must see, hands down!</recommendation>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<description>Urination, also known as micturition, voiding, peeing, weeing, pissing, and more rarely, emiction, is the ejection of urine from the urinary bladder through the urethra to the outside of the body. In healthy humans the process of urination is under voluntary control. In infants, some elderly individuals, and those with neurological injury or extreme psychological problems, urination may occur as an involuntary reflex. In other animals, in addition to expelling waste material, urination can mark territory or express submissiveness.</description>

<name>large breasts</name>
<description>Large breasts are breasts a fair notch larger than average, as found in some adolescent girls or fully grown women; however, as anime has no upper limit to breast size, the definition applies somewhat differently. To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>violent retribution for accidental infringement</name>
<description>A comedy / slapstick element often found in Ecchi anime: The hilarity derives from spontaneous embarrassment, overreaction of the "victim" (girl), immediate retribution for a seemingly inappropriate act, and a sense of pity with the supposed "aggressor" (boy).
Typically a boy will - through no fault of his own - stumble into a girl, thus invading her personal space. In the process the boy may e.g. pull down her skirt, grab the girl`s breasts, or accidentally kiss her. Any level-headed girl would see the accident just for what it is. Not so the girl with an overly developed sense of modesty, and a thing for violence. She - often a tsundere - will clobber the boy with excessive brutality.</description>

<name>magic circles</name>
<description>A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised.
Traditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for non-magical work such as meditation.
Generally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<description>A nun and an inquisitor belonging to the Holy Dynasty. A fundamentalist, she is an extremely strict, yet devoted follower of God who is known for executing heretics, usually by burning them alive. Although many call her a cruel person, she is actually a virtuous woman, but she is too serious and inflexible and does not hesitate in judging people.
In the OVA prologue, it is revealed that prior to her title as Inquisitor, she was stationed at the 16th monastery, and was invited by the Holy Dynasty to worship in the Grand Cathedral. During that time, she met Ymir following a skirmish with some drunken women, and has grown acquainted to her despite the latter`s merchant-like personality. It is also shown that she tends to rush with her Holy Poses, often rendering them ineffective.
Siggy is very eager to bring down the Rebel Army, who she considers to be a band of heretics, and sees their leader Annelotte, who carries demon blood, as an abomination. She also considers the use of alchemy as a heresy (even the Holy Dynasty has divided opinions on this topic). She is armed with the Holy Flame Mace and God`s Chained Blade, and her fighting skills rivals Annelotte`s. Like Melpha in Queen`s Blade, she is also a user of the "Divine Power", the manifestation of God`s miracles utilized by the provocative "Holy Poses". Later on, she has a crisis of faith, but Annelotte helps her and tells her she doesn`t have to fight alone anymore. She ends up joining the Rebel Army, where she calls Annelotte "Elder Sister".

She fights using four tentacles that extend from her hair, and her skin color changes with her personality and fighting style. When she is in her innocent, fair-skinned form, she is known as the "Sun Dancer". Out of mockery at how Huit addresses Annelotte, she calls the latter "brother".

Cool, collected and proud but also gentle in nature, she serves as a mediator for both races (though there are hardly any interaction between the dragons and humans), and is well-known among her people. Captured by the trainer (and master) Dogura, she has now become a gladiator slave forced to fight against other slaves and monsters in the Swamp Witch`s Arena, ordered to fight in exchange for the life of her Dragon Ride, Asher.
Despite being put through numerous death matches, Branwen`s pride as a Dragon Descendant will not allow her to die easily. Her power as a Dragon Descendant is immense, and when she cannot suppress her anger any longer, she becomes a malevolent Dragon Warrior, pulverizing every enemy before her. Created by Odanon.

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Nanase Haruka is the vice president of the Babel Student Council, and is also chair of the school`s committee on public morals. As such, she tries to confront Akatsuki for his perverted behaviour, but, underestimating his power, winds up becoming the victim of his antics instead, for example having her bra and panties stolen out from under her clothes when she tries to attack him, and getting stripped completely naked by him during the beach game, when Akatsuki would just take the tops off other girls` bikinis. As such, she appears to dislike Akatsuki, but towards the end of the series she seems to develop a crush on him in classic tsundere fashion.
She uses wind magic, and her AD is in the form of mid-handled blades somewhat resembling large Eskimo ulu knives.</description>

<description>Izumi Chikage is a female student of class B. She is rather tomboyish and has a very friendly disposition, so she was the first student to talk to Akatsuki and Miu when they entered Babel. After the gym storehouse incident with Akatsuki, Miu, and Kuzuha, they all became very good friends. She is also a lesbian and is not ashamed to admit it, having a liking for cute girls such as Miu.
She has the ability to use water magic, and her AD takes the form of a bow.</description>

<description>Doumoto Kuzuha is the representative of Class B. She is actually of elementary school age, but was accelerated to high school at Babel because of her exceptional intelligence and skill. She initially disliked Akatsuki, but after he helped her regain confidence after she had been looked down upon by the rest of the student council, they became good friends. She is also close friends to Chikage and Miu.
She specialises in earth magic and her AD takes the form of a giant warhammer.</description>

<name>Ousawa Akatsuki</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Ousawa Akatsuki is the main protagonist of the anime. After having defeated the Demon King Maou Galious in the world of Alayzard, he is hailed as the True Hero. The Demon King entrusted to him his daughter Miu, whom he secretly brought to Earth. Given his reckless and mischievous behaviour, he was also known as the "Rogue Hero".
On Earth, he is pressed, along with Miu (posing as his long-lost younger sister) into Babel School, along with all other people who have returned from sojourns to other worlds. As a student, he is generally laid back and kind-hearted by nature, though he will ruthlessly respond to aggression against himself or the people he cares about. He also has a mischievous side, and is known to do perverted things such as stealing girls` underwear from under their clothes.
In battle he has considerable physical strength, speed, and endurance, as befits a hero. Though he lacks the ability to use magic, he has a mysterious power capable of controlling the Chi energy within himself, people around him, and the environment. This power is presumably the origin of his great physical prowess. He is initially unable to use an AD, but later on after getting several more AD bands from other students he manages to materialize an oversized black sword inscribed with runes called Lævateinn.</description>

<name>Ousawa Miu</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Ousawa Miu is the daughter of the Demon King Maou Gallious. She was entrusted to Akatsuki by her father, and Akatsuki brought her back to Earth where she was pressed into Babel School, and took Akatsuki`s surname `Ousawa` as she was posing as his long-lost younger sister. She has extremely large breasts, so big that they frequently break the buttons on her uniform or bra, and leave an opening on her gym clothes big enough through which her cleavage is visible. She is rather shy and timid and is initially afraid to make friends but soon enough becomes close to Kuzuha and Chikage with her "brother`s" prodding.
She has rather significant magical ability, being able to use magic from several elements at once, where most other magic-users are restricted to a single element (though she seems to favour air magic in particular) and generate magical shields with hardly any effort. Her AD takes the form of a staff with an ornate head, called Holy Tin. She has so far used this only for blocking attacks but presumably it helps in her magic use.</description>

He appears to be much more powerful than he lets on, and seems to have a secret agenda of his own. He has, however, not yet confronted Akatsuki directly, whom he believes has yet to reveal his full strength.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Phil Barnett is a knight in the Disdian army, and presumably he was also, just like Akatsuki, originally a native of Earth before coming to Alayzard. After the demonic tribes that remained after the defeat of Maou Galious begin to grow restive, a council of the kingdoms of Alayzard realize that this is because they know that their king`s daughter still lives. The council decided, against Queen Risty`s objections, to send Phil to Earth to destroy Miu and Akatsuki.
In battle he uses a poisoned sword. He made a contract with the dragon Zahhaku, and is capable of using the dragon`s powers, even transforming into dragon form.</description>
