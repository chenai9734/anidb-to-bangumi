<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<description>What the anime is based on! This is given as the original work credit in the OP. Mostly of academic interest, but a useful bit of info, hinting at the possible depth of story.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>Shirou Kamui is a powerful esper whose destiny is to decide whether the world should be destroyed so it may be reborn without humanity or to save the world so humanity can continue to live in its current state.

At the age of nine he left Tokyo with his mother, and his return to Tokyo seven years later begins the events of the story.
Kamui also appears in Tsubasa Chronicle: Tokyo Revelations, as one of the vampire twins Seishirou is after. He leads the fighters of the City Hall faction (alternate versions of the Dragons of Earth) in a battle to protect their water source.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kigai Yuuto is a polite but amoral young man who works as a bureaucrat in a Tokyo Ward Office. He never lets on to the happy young couples turning in their marriage licenses that he is a Dragon of Earth who seeks to destroy humanity. He is frequently dressed in a pink shirt and white overcoat, and most people who see him remark that he looks like a pimp. He is Kanoe`s lover but is amused that Satsuki seems to have a crush on him.
He is a water master, having the ability to summon floods and hurl water bolts. He can even transform himself into water, once saving Satsuki from being recaptured by the Freemasons by entering the parking lot where she faced them through the sprinkler system. His natural enemy is fire, and as such he comes up against Kasumi Karen on more than one occasion.
