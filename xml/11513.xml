<description>A song from a concept album about an imaginary town that is built on top of a catfish. All of the songs are stories that happen in the town. The idea of having a miniature town was one of Yonezu`s first when planning the album, and he created characters and stories for the people who lived in the town. Yonezu considers the lyrics of "vivi" to be the closest to his own feelings.

<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>
