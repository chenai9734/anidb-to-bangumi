<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="265326">A very cool anime  with a slow story buildup but very exiting . The end is left to freely, like everything goes back to normal and yet it was normal from episode 1 :D  (new viewers will get this after they finish it)
I WOULD DO ANYTHING JUST TO SEE MORE RANDOM EPISODES WITH THE CHARACTERS  !! ITS JUST TO FUN TO SEE THE CHARACTER INTERACTION !!

ESPECIALLY SIZUOU  and IAZAAAYAAA !!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="477067">Such an awesome cast of characters, premise full of mystery, but for me it fell short of expectations. Good, but it could have been better.
In the end, even if you like the series, the whole teenagers in control of adolescent gangs thing is pretty silly. The conclusion was flaky, dunohan mystery not entirely solved. Izahara was the most interesting but wasn`t fleshed out till the end.
Still a memorable anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="547997">I put off watching this for a long time, and regretted doing so afterwards.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="354280">Several interesting and unique characters interact to form an intricate web of a plot.  This is an excellent show for anyone who likes a strong storyline.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="211568">The first episodes were a bit slow when it came to action, the plot seemed a bit boring, but after they _did_ get to the action part, every episode ended with a cliffhanger that made me want to watch the next ep asap.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="475083">I really enjoyed watching this, I wouldn`t say its the best but yeah.. definitely something different.

I loved how almost each episode has its own little box of surprises and watching them being unfold... I also liked the comedy that were thrown into it. Although it does has its faults and what not, which is normal of course.. :P

Overall I enjoyed everything about it, but not enough for me to say its a "must see!". I`d say go give it a shot, you`ll won`t regret it. :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="330647">This series has a decent mix of action, schemes, and comedy. It is well-executed, though I felt that the ending didn`t quite tie up all the loose ends it could tie up. Nevertheless, this is a recommended series to watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="28647">It starts off with a bang and showed tons of promise.  All in all it`s alright.  Not the best but, definitely not horrible.  Just a bit too positive and mushy for my liking.  I would still say watch it, but it didn`t turn out anything like I wanted or thought it would.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="38355">Got the same offbeat style as Baccano and an equally crazy cast of chars, but doesn`t jump around chronologically and is easier to follow.  Liking it more with each episode.  *flings vending machine*</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="354929">ive seen loads of animes, this one must be the best of em all ;P</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="105877">I think people who liked Boogiepop Phantom will like this too and vise versa.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="379712">By far one of the best anime in recent history, if you liked Baccano! you will undoubtedly love Durarara!! - its in the same vein in that its very character driven but it stays in one place and time. If you were confused by what the eff was going on in Baccano! you dont have to worry about the same problem. I definitely reccomend this to anyone who considers themselves a real anime fan. This show has yet to dissapoint even once.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="37655">Durarara likes to play with your perception, so the plot will keep you guessing until sudden twists put it all into place.
The animation and story is great and it has likeable, memorable characters. 
Even if some of them might seem like stereotypes at first, nothing is as it seems here. I must definitely recommend this great anime! 
Now if you`ll excuse me...  
IIIZZAAAYAAAAAA!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="278873">Must watch!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="121681">Great. I enjoyed every minute off it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="459074">This anime is surely my favorite! The characters were amazing, fun and cool. The plot was awesome and was very entertaining. There were so many characters that had so many different traits, I could connect to all of them in some way, shape, or form.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="207137">This anime is highly recommended. Interesting storyline, animation and characters. Also includes the awesome opening.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="364344">like baccano, except in modern day japan.
as in, WATCH THIS</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="128918">Absolutely love it!  I am putting it up higher than Bebop, Trigun, and outlaw star (My top 3 favorites).  It grabs your attention and does not let go.  A must see if anyone watches various anime or if you have simply seen Dragonball Z.  Cannot get enough.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="75679">makes you gradually but surely an addict</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="443546">keeps your mind from very beginnig, while Baccano takes like 10 series to understand what`s actually going on.
good, barely predictable plot. intresting and fun characters. 
for this anime it is needless to say that this is must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="436108">What can I say? this anime is awesome I loved everything in it from the characters to the plot, animation, even the opening was trully amanzing (at least the 2nd one) to me. A must see indeed 10/10.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="482666">after a couple of episodes some might call it weird , i call it incredible ..the plot is great and very easy to understand even though the show doesn`t try to explain every single thing but instead let`s you connect everything ..but the most amazing thing in this series are the characters who really make the whole story and ploy anyway since you get to see the incidents that occur in the show through every ones eyes and see their intentions , thoughts , histories and how everything falls together as the story progresses ..the soundtrack is also amazing..overall this anime is really incredible and i recommend it to everyone ! 10/10</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="296097">great music, animation and story. definitely a must see!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="178698">Brilliant anime. Great characters, plot and combination of events. The way the anime is presented is also impressive, and let`s not forget how extremely hilarious it is.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="474919">I absolutely loved everything about this show ever. 
Every time a new plot twist popped up I could feel the excitement rushing through my veins- the kind of feeling that only happens with that really good show you happen to stumble across. 
Go watch it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="194702">Masterpiece!! One of its kind with a unique storytelling and wonderful characters. Absolute must see! :D</recommendation>

<description>* Based on a light novel series written by http://anidb.net/cr6455 [Narita Ryougo] and illustrations by http://anidb.net/cr6889 [Yasuda Suzuhito].
http://anidb.net/ch12150 [Ryuugamine Mikado] had always wanted to live the busy city life, and his dream becomes a reality when he moves to Ikebukuro, Tokyo to attend school with a childhood friend he had not seen in years, http://anidb.net/ch12151 [Kida Masaomi]. Upon Mikado`s arrival, Masaomi warns him about relevant people to never cross in the city, such as http://anidb.net/ch12152 [Heiwajima Shizuo], a violently short-tempered and ridiculously strong man in a bartender suit; http://anidb.net/ch12153 [Orihara Izaya], a dangerously well-informed information broker; and a mysterious gang known as the http://anidb.net/ch14864 [Dollars]. Mikado does not take long to find that, those clearly dangerous people aside, Ikebukuro is home to many more mysteries, such as a female biker who is known as the http://anidb.net/ch12149 [Black Rider] over riding around town clad in black on a black motorcycle that occasionally neighs like a horse, and who is also rumoured to have no head under her helmet.

<name>horny nosebleed</name>
<description>In Japanese media, healthy young men who have no other sexual outlet will often suffer nosebleeds upon seeing the naked female body, or even just a pair of well-filled panties.
The nosebleed is, of course, a visual shorthand/euphemism for sexual arousal. It is commonly interpreted that way for males and females, with little trickles of blood indicating mild arousal, and gushing fountains of blood indicating erection/extreme arousal in both sexes. It can also be interpreted as shorthand strictly for erections in males. In that case, when blood shoots from the nose explosively, and in ridiculous quantity, the implication would be an ejaculation.

<name>delinquent</name>
<description>Delinquents - Every school has them, but not all anime with school setting make delinquents a central topic. There are several versions of these delinquents, though some are grounded on a misunderstanding:
* The student with a really bad image and attitude, based on his real criminal actions outside of the school and is even feared by teachers.
* The primitive "class bully" that pushes around ("clobbers") his classmates for no apparent reason, possibly extorting lunch money.
* The student with an sinister complexion or "evil eye", but is actually a "good" student (unfoundedly feared character).
* The rebellious student, who does not care for studying, but is otherwise docile. Called a "delinquent" as a joke.</description>

<name>ganguro</name>
<description>Ganguro ("Black Face Girls") is a fashion trend among Japanese women, characterised by blonde or orange hair, tanned skin, black ink used as eye-liner, and white concealer used as lipstick and eyeshadow. False eyelashes, plastic facial gems, and pearl powder are often included. It peaked in popularity around the year 2000. The Shibuya and Ikebukuro districts of Tokyo were the centres of Ganguro fashion.
Ganguro appeared as a new fashion style in Japan in the early 1990s and to date is prevalent mostly among young women. In Ganguro fashion, a deep tan is combined with hair dyed in shades of orange to blonde, or a silver grey known as "high bleached". Black ink is used as eye-liner and white concealer is used as lipstick and eyeshadow. False eyelashes, plastic facial gems, and pearl powder are often added to this. Platform shoes and brightly-coloured outfits complete the ganguro look. Also typical of Ganguro fashion are tie-dyed sarongs, miniskirts, stickers on the face, and many bracelets, rings, and necklaces.
Ganguro falls into the larger subculture of Gyaru (from English "gal"), a slang term used for various groups of young women, usually referring to overly childish or rebellious girls. Researchers in the field of Japanese studies believe that Ganguro is a form of revenge against traditional Japanese society due to resentment of neglect, isolation, and constraint of Japanese society. This is their attempt at individuality, self-expression, and freedom, in open defiance of school standards and regulations. Fashion magazines like Egg and Ageha have had a direct influence on the Ganguro. Other popular Ganguro magazines include Popteen and Ego System. The Ganguro culture is often linked with para para, a Japanese dance style. However, most para para dancers are not Ganguro, and most Ganguro are not para para dancers, though there are many who are Ganguro or Gal and dance para para.
One of the most famous early Ganguro girls was known as Buriteri, nicknamed after the black soy sauce used to flavor yellowtail fish in teriyaki cooking. Egg made her a star by frequently featuring her in its pages during the height of the Ganguro craze. After modelling and advertising for the Shibuya tanning salon "Blacky", social pressure and negative press convinced Buriteri to retire from the Ganguro lifestyle.</description>

<name>amnesia</name>
<description>The character suffers from some kind of amnesia (memory disturbance or loss). This may mean inability to memorize new information, or inability to recollect old memories. Since there are many types of memory, the person may e.g. forget who they are but still retain learned skills.
Amnesia is fairly common in fiction as a plot device. In fact, because it allows for major plot changes while requiring little creativity from the author, it may be subject to heavy overuse.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<name>absurdist humour</name>
<description>Surreal humour, also known as absurdist humour, is a form of humour predicated on deliberate violations of causal reasoning, producing events and behaviours that are obviously illogical. Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, non-sequiturs, irrational or absurd situations, and expressions of nonsense.
The humour arises from a subversion of audience`s expectations, so that amusement is founded on unpredictability, separate from a logical analysis of the situation. Its appeal stems from the fact that the situation described is exceedingly ridiculous or unlikely.
On an analytical level, all jokes contain a certain amount of incongruity, but while regular jokes carry an incongruity that the audience accepts as compatible with expectations, absurd jokes are characterized by a disproportionate amount of it, with the punch line delivering a situation incompatible with the world as we know it and failing to resolve the matter in the audience`s eyes.

<name>medium awareness</name>
<description>Medium awareness is the situational and generally temporary awareness characters in works of fiction have and display of the very fact that they are characters in works of fiction. For example, they may comment about the background music, quip about the script or narration, complain about the roles given to them by the writer or their lack of screen time, see the subtitles that appear on screen, inform the audience about the arrival of the commercial break, and even use medium effects as tools. The most common form of medium awareness is known as breaking the fourth wall, in which characters speak directly to the audience, either to it as a whole or to specific members of it. The "fourth wall" is the imaginary "wall" at the front of the stage of a proscenium theatre through which the audience sees the play; it is a metaphor for the boundary between what happens inside the work, to the characters, and outside it, to the audience.</description>

<description>Large breasts are breasts a fair notch larger than average, as found in some adolescent girls or fully grown women; however, as anime has no upper limit to breast size, the definition applies somewhat differently. To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

Films noirs were typically crime dramas or psychological thrillers featuring a pessimistic worldview and starring conflicted antiheroes trapped in difficult situations and making choices out of desperation or nihilistic moral systems, with crime, especially murder, being featured on the majority of them. Some of the most obvious visual elements included low-key lighting, striking use of light and shadow, black-and-white filming, and unusual camera placement such as low-angle, wide-angle, and Dutch angle shots.
Film noir is often associated with urban settings, private detectives, femmes fatales, and bleak endings, but they are not necessary to the genre; a large number of these films, including some of the genre classics, take place in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road, feature neither character type, and have clearly happy endings.
Film noir and the early neo-noir would come to influence the formation of tech noir, a crossover of neo-noir and science fiction, in the late 1970s; some the most influencial tech noir works are the American movies Alien (1979), Blade Runner (1982), and The Terminator (1984). Tech noir itself would also help form http://anidb.net/t2861 [cyberpunk] in the early 1980s.</description>

<name>ensemble cast</name>
<description>A show with an ensemble cast focuses on a larger group of main characters in a single plot narrative; anime containing several segmented plot narratives (such as episodic or arc-based plots) are excluded. As such, it doesn`t really have a "main" or "lead" character; instead, every member of the central main character group plays an important part in the show`s grander scheme; no single character is more important or prominent than the others (equality of importance). Further, subplots (if any) lead by each character in the ensemble have equal weighting in importance (or lack of weight).

* In a show where no single main character is more important or prominent than the others, 4+ main characters is almost always an ensemble cast.
* A show with 3 main characters of equal importance is likely also an ensemble cast; equality of importance must be considered carefully.
* A show with 2 main characters of equal importance is generally not an ensemble cast situation; however, on an exception basis where neither main character is considered an antagonist, a 2-main-character anime may be considered an ensemble (e.g. http://anidb.net/a11829 [Kimi no Na wa.]).

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

<name>psychological manipulation</name>
<description>Psychological manipulation is a type of social influence that aims to change the perception or behaviour of others through underhanded, deceptive, or even abusive tactics. By advancing the interests of the manipulator, often at the other`s expense, such methods could be considered exploitative, abusive, devious, and deceptive. 
Social influence is not necessarily negative. For example, doctors can try to persuade patients to change unhealthy habits. Social influence is generally perceived to be harmless when it respects the right of the influenced to accept or reject it, and is not unduly coercive. Depending on the context and motivations, social influence may constitute underhanded manipulation.

<description>The most common example is that of a voice, either that of one of the characters or entirely unrelated, that appears at the beginning of an episode to offer a summary or introduction, and at the end of an episode for closure or for a preview to hint upon what to expect next.
Another use of narration comes in the form of a dominant voice belonging to one of the protagonists, intended only for the viewer and revealing the intimate thoughts to whom it belongs. This type of narration occurs frequently throughout the duration of the episode or movie.</description>

<description>In this anime, some characters "speak" foreign languages, successfully making the audience`s ears bleed. That is especially true if the viewer is a native speaker of or otherwise proficient in the languages in question.
The foreigners in the show do not seem to take much notice of the fact that their supposed native languages are being massacred. In fact, oftentimes they also actively participate in the butchering of said languages. That happens, of course, because they, too, are voiced by Japanese people without knowledge of the language they`re supposed to speak, or to pretend to speak at any rate.</description>

<name>gangs</name>
<description>A gang is a group of people, through the organization, formation, and establishment of an assemblage, share a common identity. In current usage it typically denotes a criminal organization or else a criminal affiliation. In early usage, the word gang referred to a group of workmen. In the United Kingdom the word is still often used in this sense, but it later underwent pejoration. The word gang often carries a negative connotation; however, within a gang which defines itself in opposition to mainstream norms, members may adopt the phrase as a statement of identity or defiance.
The word "gang" derives from the past participle of Old English gan "to go". It is cognate with Old Norse gangr, meaning "journey."</description>

Let`s throw in some gripping orchestral music, lighting changes, different camera angles, something! Don`t write like a man, write like an evil overlord! Exaggerate your expressions and gestures, speak with excessive intonation, and if all else fails, throw in some close-ups, slow motion, and ominous Latin chanting! With practice, even you can turn something like eating chips into an epic battle of light and dark, blinding the viewer with sheer awesomeness.

<description>A term usually used to describe a situation, where a seemingly smart and cunning villain sets up a plan that seems grand and impressive, but is actually long winding, ridiculous, and convoluted. And all of that just to trick his opponent(s), like the hero or anybody else, into doing things exactly as he planned. Suffice to say that the villain could have reached his goal by much shorter and easier means, it just wouldn`t seem as awesome anymore.
The phrase is also known as the original Japanese "keikaku doori" where keikaku stands translated for "plan" or "schedule", and doori for "in accordance with ..." or "following ...".
The phrase is a reference to http://anidb.net/ch301 [Yagami Light] from http://anidb.net/a4563 [Death Note], and his love for plans.</description>

<description>Shana is the female lead of the show and a Flame Haze. Initially she is concentrated solely on her duty as a Flame Haze, going as far as to not bearing even a name. She sees Yuuji only as a Torch, an object, marginally interesting because of his status as a Mystes. Yuuji, in his need to humanize her, chose to name her "Shana" after her sword. However, she slowly opens up to Yuuji, coming to think of him as a person, despite being a Torch, and eventually comes to love him. Until she met him, she was only identified by her Flame Haze title "Flame-Haired Burning-Eyed Hunter," or her sword, Nietono no Shana.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Holo is a wolf harvest deity originally from a land in the north known as Yoitsu. She made a promise with men from a town called Pasroe where she would ensure the town would have good wheat harvests year after year. However, as time went on, the townspeople slowly started to forsake Holo and did not rely on her as they once did. As such, Holo escapes from town in Lawrence`s wagon and started traveling with him to see how much the world has changed since she has been in Pasroe. Holo has chosen the form of a girl younger than Lawrence, though she still retains her large white-tipped wolf tail, and ears. Her true form is that of a very large wolf which many people revered and feared.
She refers to herself as the "Wise Wolf of Yoitsu" (ヨイツの賢狼, Yoitsu no Kenrou). She is typically very haughty and self-sufficient, though due to her isolation for hundreds of years in Pasroe, she came to feel very lonely, and sometimes shows a more fragile side of herself. She relies on Lawrence for company as she fears loneliness, which is something that Lawrence is very aware of and tries to comfort her in his own way. Holo is also very aware of the different time spans that she and Lawrence have, as a human lifespan is like a blink of an eye for her kind. Holo is shown to be quite scared of that fact but hides it with jokes. She has a peculiar way of speaking, modeled after that of the oiran high-class courtesans. She is fond of delicious food and alcohol, but especially loves apples. She takes pride in her tail and takes special care of it, constantly combing and maintaining it.</description>

<name>Aisaka Taiga</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A girl in Ryuuji`s class. She has a well-regulated and beautiful appearance though is unable to stomach company from others. Due to her often snapping at others in brutal ways and her short stature at 143.6 cm, she is given the nickname "Palmtop Tiger". Her under-developed body and the added nickname has given her a complex which in turn serves to give her a negative attitude and facial expression. Essentially, Taiga gets upset easily and is considerably clumsy. Due to her cute looks (described as a doll by Ryuuji), she often gets confessions by boys her age, but she turns down every one of them. She comes from a rich family but due to bad family relations, she has taken to living on her own. However, since she came from a privileged household, she does not know how to do any domestic chores. When she meets Ryuuji and learns of his domestic talents, she ends up relying on Ryuuji to clean up after her. Aside from sleeping in her own house, and going to school, she spends most of her time at Ryuuji`s house; so much so that she is almost considered a member of his family. At the beginning of the story, she is infatuated with his best friend Kitamura Yuusaku to the point that she drools at her picture collection of him and gets nervous every time he appears. Due to this, Taiga and Ryuuji team up to help each other get into a relationship with each other`s best friend. However, as the story goes on, she too develops feelings for Ryuuji, commenting once how even though they are in a big room, they still sit so close together like at his cramped apartment.</description>

<name>Kushieda Minori</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A girl in Ryuuji`s class, and is a close friend to Taiga. She is also known by the pet name "Minorin". In contrast to the negative Taiga, Minori is always smiling and cheerful, but is also a natural airhead. She is very athletic and is the captain of the girl`s softball club at school, though at the same time she holds many part time jobs. She is a glutton when it comes to food, but is also constantly combating with dieting, calling herself a Diet Warrior. She has a habit of singing cheerfully off key and tends to walk with more energy than needed (such as kicking up her legs with each step). She seems to get a thrill out of being scared: she pretends to be terrified of supernatural things in hopes that others will take advantage of this statement and try to frighten her. Despite her air-headed tendencies, she is very perceptive to other people`s characters, and is one of the few people to see Ryuuji for the gentle person he is, and is also not fooled by Ami`s act of innocence.</description>

<description>Yuusaku`s childhood friend who transfers into his class midway through their second year of high school. She is very beautiful and even works as a model, though after she transfers school, she temporarily stops modelling. However, she still continues to go to the gym readily and maintains a slim figure. She is always kind and generous towards others, though this is merely a deception. In truth, she is arrogant and will not hesitate to use abusive language towards others. During her first meeting with Taiga, Ami shows her true colours, but the tables are turned when Taiga throws a counterattack back at her. Since then, Ami and Taiga have been enemies, though Ami still sometimes envies Taiga since she can always be honest. Ami has a love interest in Ryuuji, asking him if he would love her real self, going as far as to bet Taiga to a swim race for the chance of having Ryuuji all to herself at her villa. She has recently shown a deeper affection for Ryuuji when she states that Minori will not be good for him, comparing the two to her being the sun and him the moon, and if he is with her he would burn out. Then states that a person more suited for him, would be her.</description>

Mikado tries hard to change his image but so far he has not had any luck, although he does get up enough courage to become the Class Representative along with http://anidb.net/ch12155 [Anri]. Mikado has had moments where he speaks his mind, and Masaomi claims to admire this about him. He is the only remaining creator of the infamous http://anidb.net/ch14864 [Dollars] and also its leader. He seems to be infatuated with Anri Sonohara, but has never found a chance to tell her. Whenever he is close to confessing, she leaves. Mikado often gets advice from http://anidb.net/ch12153 [Izaya], particularly in relation to the Dollars and his need to seek out a life that isn`t ordinary.

He is enthusiastic about picking-up girls, but he seems to fail at it.

After http://anidb.net/ch12155 [Anri] is injured during the Slasher incidents and the rising presence of the http://anidb.net/ch14864 [Dollars], he is forced to become the leader of the Yellow Scarves once more. He despises http://anidb.net/ch12153 [Orihara Izaya] for manipulating him when he first formed the Yellow Scarves, but returns to him again for information about the leader of the Dollars and discovers it is Mikado. He leaves Ikebukuro with his ex-girlfriend, http://anidb.net/ch14873 [Mikajima Saki], during the conflict between the 3 main forces in Ikebukuro.

<description>A man who is always seen to wear sunglasses and a bartender`s suit. Although quiet and nondescript while not angered, he has a very short fuse and fights with incredible strength. Despite his simple and unrefined fighting skills, he is often considered the strongest fighter in the series. In the novels his power is described as the naturally unlimited form of human strength and likened to "adrenaline power" that can give people superhuman strength in times of emergency. In addition, Shizuo is capable of often superhuman parkour moves, a skill he obtained naturally from years of hunting down Izaya Orihara.
He works as a debt collector in Ikebukuro and carries intense animosity towards Izaya. He has a younger brother, Kasuka, who is a top idol under the showbiz name of Hanejima Yuuhei. He is also a long-time acquaintance of Selty.
His first and last name translates literally into "serene man" and "peaceful island" respectively.</description>

<description>Orihara Izaya is a young man who sells information for his own enjoyment. He claims to love the entire human race except for Shizuo Heiwajima, and exhibits said love by putting humans in often miserable conditions and observing their reactions.
He attended Raira Academy with Shizuo, Shinra and Kadota. According to Shinra, Izaya and Shizuo hated each other with a passion almost from the point they met. In the novels Izaya framed Shizuo for crimes on several occasions.
He is a master of parkour, and also quite skilled with his flickblade (the blade he uses must be slightly opened before the mechanics of it springs the blade open - a switchblade will open on its own after the user presses a switch) as he is implied to be the only one capable of leaving numerous cuts in Shizuo`s bartender suit after a fight in the novels. In the anime, he shaves a gang member`s head bald without him noticing it. Izaya has two younger sisters, Mairu and Kururi, who are twins and troublemakers.
His name comes from a combination of the biblical Isaiah and Japanese for "the one who looks over the crowd".
He is usually seen pretending to be female online and talks in a feminine manner in the chatroom. His screenname is "Kanra".</description>

<description>Shizuo`s brother.
Nowadays a famous actor and model under the name Hanejima Yuuhei (羽島 幽平), he was scouted in place of his brother when he saved the talent scout from one of his outbursts of anger. After some modeling and his debut as lead actor in the film Vampire Ninja Kaamira Saizou he gained slowly popularity over the net because of his acting abilities. After an appearance in the popular show Money Gamer, where he made 1.2 billion Yen through money investments within a month, his name appeared nationwide on news reports prompting his stardom followed by a number of leading cast appearances in TV drama.
Although a star excelling with a broad range of acting skills, once he is not in front of a camera it is as though he would lose any emotion and revert to a roboter-like state. But it is exactly this very nature of him, which makes him an idol amongst his many fans, who love his "cool expression".</description>
