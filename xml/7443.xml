<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="411166">Interesting premise, and for the most part lively and well-defined characters.
However, an unrelenting onslaught to suspension of disbelief on many fronts. Too many to list, but I call attention to the ridiculous motivations and tendencies of the various `pirates`/privateers.

A good watch if you don`t tend to read into things.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="292529">very enjoyable to watch, but at the end it feels like a 26 episodes long intro... 
The story is just about to start and I want more!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="296921">likeable characters that seem to be deftly handled versions of recognizable anime-types in a light-hearted, well-crafted slice of entertainment. A portrayal that suggests a world where suffering and pain never go down beyond a certain point. A thouroughly enjoyable change from those unbearably adolescent the-universe-is-inherently-evil productions.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="502394">The OP makes my soul burn.

Off to a pretty slow start, but because of the quality of the characters, infinite room for growth.

There are much worse shows out there.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="371767">If you go into this expecting a harsh story with lots of details and death, you`ll hate it. However, if you expect a coming of age story with light comedy that never takes itself too seriously, you`ll love it. All around quality is very good, and I look forward to a second season!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="61503">Really enjoyable show with good music, nice characters and good animation.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="303812">Good entertaining anime. Enjoyable and fun.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="53340">It`s a very light  anime, good  character design, a little slow at the start, but  you will enjoy the serie

Un aniome bastante  ligero, muy buen diseño de  personaje, un poco lenta al principio, pero una buen serie  para  disfrutar</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="628007">I liked it. But don`t ask me why because i honestly can`t say. By all means it should have been boring but watching them talk about the technical aspects and the whole strategy behind space battle kinda roped me in. If you are looking for action this is not for you. It`s laid back, relaxed, like watching someone learn how to play chess. (bad analogy?) Characters were nice, nothing more, nothing less. Art Style was right up my alley, I mean great captains coat over high school girl uniform is so strange it`s cool.
All in all I had fun watching it with a friend.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="382689">Cute characters and pretty accurate physics.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="161958">your average high school girl intro.
But instead of the average must fulfill destiny, this is about the girl learning to be a pirate HER way.
No magic, no secrets, exploring to be a pirate and excellent character support. True some characters are to obvious added but otherwise it would not be a anime.

If you like space, technological combat and freedom of a pirate. this is something for you.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on a light novel series titled Miniskirt Uchuu Pirates by http://anidb.net/cr8563 [Sasamoto Yuuichi], illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr16113 [Matsumoto Noriyuki].
Most families have a skeleton or two in the closet, but http://anidb.net/ch35552 [Marika] is understandably shocked to learn that what her family has been hiding is a skull and crossbones! And while the revelation that her late father was a space pirate would have been earthshaking enough for most teenage girls, discovering that he was the captain of the notorious pirate ship http://anidb.net/ch45948 [Bentenmaru] will change Marika`s life forever, since pirating is a family business, and she just inherited the position of captain. Understandably her father`s former crew is quite intent on making sure Marika accepts the job. So what is she to do? Well, if you are a high school student whose prior total naval experience has been working at the space yacht club, intergalactic buccaneering will come as a challenge...

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<description>Even though school clubs in Japan are not mandatory, there is some pressure from the social grid (e.g. fellow students, teachers) to participate in some kind of after-school activity, be it in sports or arts. Colleges also have clubs.
As a comedy element in anime, some students have joined too many clubs, and are thus constantly stressed out. There is also the element of social commentary, making it clear that you have to join a club, if you want to be part of the class. Since self-founded clubs need at least 3 members, the desperate search and advertising for new members can be cause for hilarity in anime.</description>

Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>space pirates</name>
<description>Depending how you view the future, lawlessness will always be present in society. There`s always going to be a shadier, nastier way of doing business, and that will almost certainly follow humanity to the stars. Thus, sci-fi authors will include Expies of modern and historic (un)organized crime—be they space mafia, gangs, or—in our case—pirates.
It`s not as anachronistic as it might seem. After all, pirates themselves have made a Real Life comeback in Somalia, and it`s a lucrative enough "business" that it`s taken a multinational military response to fight back. Surely an established society in outer space with significant trade and commerce would suffer similar problems!
... Well, maybe. The major problem with space pirates preying on space commerce is that space is vast. The challenge of catching commercial shipping in open space is orders of magnitudes more difficult than catching them on the open seas. Sometimes, this is cleverly worked around and justified. Most of the time, however, it isn`t.
There are two kinds of Space Pirates in science fiction. The normal version are violent criminals with a spaceship, who attack other spaceships, just like present-day pirates. Once you have shipping between different solar systems/planets, pirates preying on said shipping are bound to show. Simple as that. Done this way, piracy actually makes sense, provided there`s an enabling factor. That could be anything from the technology of the setting creating trade lanes (via a Portal Network, predictable Faster Than Light Travel routes thanks to Negative Space Wedgies, or timed space flights between planets to reduce time spent between planets, as in Real Life), to using a variant of the method employed by modern pirates (say, smaller ships striking at commercial shipping in the orbit of a planet).
The other version does a Recycled In SPACE on every eighteenth century pirate cliche ever. Reasons for including this version will typically be along the lines of "Because Space Is An Ocean, it has to have Pirates" rather than making any meaningful attempt at justifying their existence. They have Cornish accents, beards, say "Arr!" a lot, have parrots (probably robot) and false limbs (probably cybernetic) and wear tricorn hats and eyepatches (or have cybernetic eyes). They may even have ships shaped like boats.
One of the best known space pirates is http://anidb.net/ch2087 [Captain Harlock] from the same named popular http://anidb.net/a725 [TV anime series].

<name>CGI</name>
<description>Computer-generated imagery (CGI) or computer animation is the art of creating moving images via the use of computers. It is a subfield of computer graphics and animation. Increasingly it is created by means of 3D computer graphics, though 2D computer graphics are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time rendering needs. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another medium, such as film.</description>

<description>There is some intellectual battle between the characters. They each might attempt to discern what the other knows and/or could be planning. Then, rather than simply relying on the use of raw power, try to deduce an effective strategy to foil their opponent(s). The battle of wits can be in the center of the intrigue or just a side story.

<name>3D CG animation</name>
<description>Abbreviation for "three-dimensional computer generated animation" or "computer graphics" (CGI). The traditional 2D art is enhanced by 3D imagery developed through computer modeling software. Done in the right way, this union of 3D in a 2D animated world can be a very beautiful relationship.
The difference lies in what lacks the traditional 2D animation all together and may give term to something produced entirely with 3D graphics (such as the 2006 remake of "Appleseed" , 2007`s "Vexille", the 2008 addition to the "Biohazard" series and the more well known "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within" and "Advent Children").</description>
