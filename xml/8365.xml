<description>Hanabeam is the lead track and video from Hifana`s album 24H, released July 28, 2010. With the sound of fireworks at the core, this explosive single was composed by Hifana and is a fresh sonic expression of a Japanese summer matsuri (festival), filtered through Hifana`s signature Tokyo-born Japanese hybrid breakbeats. The video, co-directed by Fantasista Utamaro and Shane Lester, is another potent expression of Hifana`s unique mixing of the old and new of Japanese aesthetics, updating and hybridizing the rich cultural traditions of matsuri and hanabi (fireworks). Hifana are represented by two Hanabi-shi (fireworks craftsmen) in this video, as they gradually re-energize a depressed city through the power of their beats, arriving at an enchanted temple where they unleash their final ultimate hanabi, triggering a colorful climax of explosive energy.</description>
