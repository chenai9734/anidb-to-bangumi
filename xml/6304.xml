<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="277062">This anime is wonderful.Despite the lack of action in the middle, the adventures and humor showed were awesome. But, the final chapter was too fast and let some pieces without link, so I hope a 2nd season with more action and fun.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="1057">I don`t know about this being the best story ever, but as far as harem animes goes, this is the best you`ll find (the bar is quite a bit lower for them). Each female love interest is very well developed, as is Kenshis relationship with them. A lot of things in the story as well as the world they exist in seemed like very `plastic-ie` filler in between his interactions with his female interests.

If you`re looking for a truly unique story that`s very well done I`d suggest looking elsewhere though. This is simply a really good harem, rather then a epic anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="255705">A quick "light" harem mecha anime with silly humor on top -  enjoyable to watch</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="621853">Harem Comedy and Nice Story 10/10 :D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="292763">AWESOME. This anime is too awesome!! A must see for those who love mecha and fantasy. Well I fell in love with this anime since I saw the cover xD. After finish watching it I fell in love again!  Too bad if it is 26 eps or more it would be nice as they can do many things with the story :P This anime is one of the rare that i give 10 rating!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="180244">It`s strong and modern, yet also done in the style of a classic harem.  And just as it should be, like the girls in the story I find myself more and more attached to Kenshi as the series moves forward!  Just the way a classic harem should be!
This is a definite MUST SEE!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="183638">great slow sub</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="249348">A Tenchi anime with a more traditional cast of girls (pink haired tsundere, short blonde dom, hot dark-skined elf, glasses wearing shy type, etc), it puts a decent spin on the personalities but the other tenchi series were bolder and put more interesting types into the mix.

The anime maintains the usual high quality that is expected of a a tenchi series while also being a slight parody of itself. 
Compared to tenchi or Seina (GXP) Kenshi is abnormally confident at combat/chores while seeming a lot more passive with girls, it works for the setting as the anime can jump straight into the character interrations.

In the end it`s a great harem anime with combat scenes that pure mecha anime would be proud of.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="764835">A fun romp even though I`m not a harem fan generally there is enough action/humor to carry this series.

I just wish I had a better subbed version there are so many contradictions that I consider this the worst subbed anime I`ve ever watched.  It`s obvious whoever did that didn`t go back and see if it made sense...oh well still worth watching and I`m sure if I understood Japanese it would make a world of difference.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="343851">Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari is the best harem anime I have ever seen !</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="401765">I`ve never seen anything from the Tenchi universe before, but this OVA totally exceeded my expactations. It might be unrealistic at times but the story appealed to me and I really enjoyed watching it. I haven`t watched ecchi anime for a while, nor had i expected to, but I enjoyed this anime nontheless.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="26239">Great, I wish more animes were like this one.  Harem, but not ecchi.  Action, but not gorey.  Funny, but not slapstick.  A great combination of genres that balance each other out nicely.  AND its a mecha anime!  I usually hate those!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="336446">well its the best harem ever made plus the Kenshi is like Luffy with harem xD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters are just perfect especially Aura Shurifon. Tho Lashara is dull but maybe she will develope later :P Well so far )6th ep.) its one of my favorite series ever made ! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAIL Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="251933">Epic</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="294356">Best harem anime I have seen.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="297053">The best harem ever + the most powerful main character ever</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="277698">the son of new wadded Tenchi father (son of REIA) is the child that is send to the other world by Hakubi Washuu as we know in Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari - 10 time (18:50 to 20:00)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="399476">One of the best mecha or medieval serie so far =)
I don`t know why they took Kenshi from Tenchi Muyo (they could have created a new serie, the fact he is Tenchi cousin really isn`t important).
But i`m really happy to see finally a good serie from Tenchi Muyo after so crappy anime (like shin tenchi muyo or Ryououki Daisanki), it`s at the level of the first OVA, even better.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="270436">Great storyline and flow.  No filler with all the Tenchi... I mean, Kenshi goodness one comes to expect.  Another excellent spin-off from the makers of Tenchi Muyo.  Seriously hoping for another season!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="514250">I watched it twice and might watch it again. It is very good.</recommendation>

<description>http://anidb.net/ch5329 [Masaki Kenshi] is a 15-year-old boy that has unwillingly travelled from his home on Earth to the alternate world of Geminar. On Geminar, the countries wage wars using Sacred Mechanoids, humanoid exoskeletal weapons that were originally discovered within ancient ruins and developed over centuries. After being tricked by a mysterious organization into participating in an attempt to assassinate http://anidb.net/ch5330 [Lashara Earth] XXVIII, the young princess of the Shtrayu Empire, he ends up captured after he chooses not to kill her. When Lashara hears the truth, she decides to help.
Disguised as her attendant, Kenshi travels with her to the Holy Land, a virtually impregnable fortress that serves as an academy to train Sacred Mechanoid pilots, most of whom are female. With his kindness, tenacity, and skills that vary from carpentry to advanced techniques of survival, Kenshi eventually becomes a celebrity in the academy, becoming the object of affection of many female students and making some of the male students envious. However, the same organization that deceived Kenshi is secretly working inside and against the academy, and a worldwide conflict is about to begin.

<name>elf</name>
<description>The origin of Elves (Norse; álfar(elves), álfr(elf)) can be found in ancient Norse mythology, in which, elves are described as divine, or near-divine, race of humanoids (Vættir), likened to the Æsir. In common description they are described as sage and immortal beings occupying the threshold between humans and the gods. In some cases humans that were beloved by the gods became elves within their lives. Ancient Elves are delineated into a pair of similar but distinct races; Light Elves (Ljósálfar) and Dark Elves (Svartálfar), each originating from separate homes within the nine worlds of Yggdrasil. Within the Poetic Edda the differences are commonly ascribed as:
"There is one place there that is called the Elf Home (Álfheimr which is the elven city). People live there that are named the light elves (Ljósálfar). But the dark elves (Dökkálfar) live below in earth, in caves and the dark forest and they are unlike them in appearance - and more unlike them in reality. The Light Elves are brighter than the sun in appearance, but the Dark Elves are blacker than pitch." (Snorri, Gylfaginning 17, Prose Edda)</description>

Often seen in so-called Maid Cafes in Akihabara, where male customers can for a little time enjoy the feeling of being served by a woman. The male gender opposite is the butler.</description>

<name>zettai ryouiki</name>
<description>"Absolute Territory" (絶対領域, Zettai Ryouiki in Japanese) describes the area of uncovered thigh between the skirt and the knee sock.
As per usual for fandom who obsess about costumes, this can be considered a moe attribute and thus, present prominently in character designs and schoolgirl outfits. The term originates from http://anidb.net/a22 [Neon Genesis Evangelion] to designate an area of Absolute Terror, although it`s had considerable semantic drift. In this case, it may jokingly refer to the fact it emphasizes a shorter skirt without actually becoming creepy and showing the underpants.
As if that wasn`t enough, some even categorize it into five "Grades", from E to A. Only the top two (A and B) are considered true Zettai Ryouiki and they are only usable by female characters. Some researchers additionally introduce Grade S, the highest one which consists of Grade A plus further requirements to personality and hairstyle.
Just to make it clear, Zettai Ryouiki is made up of three components: socks, skin, and skirt. An Action Girl may trade the latter for hotpants but if it doesn`t include knee-highs and thighs, it`s not Zettai Ryouiki. Panty Shot is an entirely different zone.

<name>swimsuit</name>
<description>A swimsuit is one of several kinds of garments designed to be worn by people engaging in water-based activities or sports or during certain activities under sunlight. Most kinds of swimsuit reveal a large portion of the body surface area, but exceptions exist. The more revealing kinds may also be worn as undergarment in sports that require wetsuits, or when there is a need to display the body, as in the case of beauty pageants or bodybuilding contests.
There is a very wide range of styles of modern swimsuits, which vary in relation to body coverage and materials. The choice of style of swimsuit is dependent on current fashions, community standards of modesty, and plain personal preference. Swimsuits for men usually expose the chest, while those for women do not usually do so; however, many women prefer to engage in water or sun activities with their torso uncovered, in a practice commonly described as toplessness or topfreedom. Since the early twentieth century a naturist movement has developed in western countries that seeks a return to non-sexual nakedness when swimming and during other appropriate activities; in some places around the world, nude beaches have been set aside for people who choose to engage in normal beach activities in the nude, and such beaches may or may not enforce nudity onto their goers.
In anime, it is common for at least one episode to feature the characters in swimsuits, usually as an excuse for gratuitous fanservice; when that happens, the episode is usually labeled a pool or beach episode, after the place the characters went to. Swimsuits, and in particular one-piece swimsuits, are a very common fetish in Japan; while the reason for that is uncertain, a common folk explanation is the fact that boys throughout their entire adolescence are commonly exposed to their female classmates wearing them, in what might be called an experiment in sexual discovery waiting to happen.</description>

<name>tsundere</name>
<description>Tsundere (ツンデレ) (pronounced /(t)sʌnˈdɪə(r)/ in English or /t͡sun.de.ɽe/ in Japanese) is a Japanese concept of a character archetype which describes a person with a conceited, irritable, and/or violent personality that suddenly becomes modest and loving when triggered by some sort of cause (such as being alone with someone). The inverse scenario, where a modest and loving person becomes conceited/irritable/violent, is also a tsundere.
The default state does not matter. The character can default to "tsuntsun" or "deredere"; the key concept is the fact that there`s a (generally very quick) flip from one mode to the other.
It can also describe a contradictory personality which is good-willed on the inside, but with a harsh attitude on the outside. Originally found in Japanese bishoujo games, the word is now part of the otaku moe phenomenon, reaching into other media such as anime, manga, novels, and even mass media.
Tsundere is a portmanteau of the two words tsuntsun (ツンツン), and deredere (デレデレ). Tsuntsun is defined as "aloof, morose, pointed", and deredere is defined as "exhausted, lovestruck". Tsunderekko (ツンデレっ娘) is a related noun, referring to a girl with a tsundere personality. Like nekomimi, tsundere is considered a moe-inspiring character trait. The concept has received increasing attention in Japan, with a tsundere cafe opened in Akihabara and tsundere-themed products released (like Tomy Co.`s portable television set), and the concept increasingly reflected in recent anime, from an extended discussion of the meaning of the concept and its origin on the internet in http://anidb.net/a4777 [Lucky Star]`s Lucky Channel segment to merchandise for http://anidb.net/a3651 [The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya] classifying the characters according to tsundere-ness. Another accepted definition of tsundere is a girl who has a combative attitude toward others but is also kind on the inside. She usually plays out as having an attitude toward the main character, usually a male, and often criticizing him in one way or another, but as the series progresses she eventually warms up to him and sometimes even falls in love with him.</description>

<name>sword</name>
<description>A sword is a long, edged piece of metal, used as a cutting, thrusting, and clubbing weapon in many civilizations throughout the world. Before firearms became commonplace, and fast enough to render other weapons pointless in the battlefield, they were the main kind of weapon for war and duels alike. A sword fundamentally consists of a blade and a hilt, typically with one or two edges for striking and cutting, and a point for thrusting. That aside, however, they may come in all sorts of designs: the medieval European swords used to be big, heavy weapons that did not actually cut but instead broke the enemy`s bones under their armor; conversely, the Chinese jian sword (called "ken" in Japanese) attempted to exploit the armor`s joints and perforate the enemy`s flesh in those places, but was useless against the armor itself, and did not take the strikes, preferring to redirect them, to this day being considered a highly "circular" weapon and associated to taijiquan; on the other hand, the Japanese katana was a balanced all-purposes weapon that could be used even in an axe-like way, but which a master swordsman could use in many other, more elaborate manners.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<description>Large breasts are breasts a fair notch larger than average, as found in some adolescent girls or fully grown women; however, as anime has no upper limit to breast size, the definition applies somewhat differently. To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>magic circles</name>
<description>A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised.
Traditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for non-magical work such as meditation.
Generally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names.

<name>parallel world</name>
<description>A parallel world, parallel universe, or alternative reality is a self-contained separate reality coexisting with our own. Because "alternative reality" sometimes implies that the reality is a variant of our own, like for example a mirror world, we use the term "parallel world/universe" which is more general, without any connotations implying a relationship (or lack thereof) with our own world/universe (meaning a fictional world can just as well have an alternative reality, it doesn`t need to be our reality). To put it more simply, this category is to show if more than 1 world/universe/reality is present in the anime.
Multiple timelines of the same world/universe/reality are NOT considered parallel worlds. For example, in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate] the cast travels through multiple "World Lines", which are defined as parallel timelines of the same universe had various events occurred with differing outcomes.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Japanese for "transformation" (metamorphosis or disguise).
A "henshin anime" is any anime, where the characters or their costumes transform, such as Sailor Moon. The henshin switches on the character`s special powers, and is frequently accompanied by a costume change. Often the change of clothing is the only outward indicator that the character has changed and yet nobody seems to notice the hero`s true self.
Most henshin heroes have a special item which they use to change into their heroic form. These items are usually activated by a command phrase (which is often in Engrish, for some reason), triggering a transformation sequence.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

This anime`s main character is comparable to the gods themselves in terms of resistibility, strength and/or downright bad-assery. Whenever they seem as if the fire inside has burnt out, they rise from the ashes with enough tenacity and ferocity to vanquish any foe that dare stand against them.</description>

<name>inconclusive romantic plot</name>
<description>This tag refers to unresolved romance in a series. It`s common in harem anime, but may also appear in normal romance series (especially if they are incomplete adaptations of novels or manga).
The protagonist doesn`t choose any of his love interests in the end and doesn`t dump any of them either. This tag does not refer to those (few) series where protagonist actually chooses all the girls on his own accord (i.e. Sekirei).</description>

<description>A term that has come to describe often exaggerated, very jiggly, fluid, and painstakingly detailed animation of female characters` bouncing breasts. 
The term has its roots in http://anidb.net/a185 [Top o Nerae!] — Gunbuster, Gainax`s first OVA (1988), in which the Gainax bounce is found unabated in the three female characters of Noriko, Kazumi, and Jung.</description>

<name>absurdly powerful student council</name>
<description>A student council is a student-managed body inside a school which engages in administrative affairs, usually usually working in a partnership with management, staff and parents, for the benefit of the whole school environment. In real life, a student council holds no actual power; however, in many anime/manga, they have an insane amount of power, which usually allows them to overrule nearly everyone else (the school board, the mayor, the prime minster, you name it). In those cases, that device is explored as a major source of slapstick comedy.</description>

<name>isekai</name>
<description>An isekai story is one in which the lead characters are transferred to and become stuck or trapped in another world, one completely different from the one they lived in up until the transfer. The new world is commonly a http://anidb.net/t2628 [fictional world], such as a http://anidb.net/t2838 [parallel world] or http://anidb.net/t2839 [virtual world] (other fictional world types can also apply). What defines the isekai genre is that the characters are sent to another world, often but not always a parallel one, and they generally cannot come back permanently without meeting a highly specific goal.
In order to adapt to their new environment, they must use the abilities and knowledge brought from their former world as well as any that may have been bestowed upon them by their brave new world. In some cases, they will seek and eventually find a way to return; in others, they will gleefully embrace their new life.
http://anidb.net/a144 [Inuyasha] is an example where isekai applies to a fictional world that is not also a parallel or virtual world. http://anidb.net/ch7246 [Higurashi Kagome] climbs down an ancient well at her grandfather`s shrine and is transported to feudal Japan (time travel). While she eventually gains the physical ability to travel back and forth between her time period and feudal Japan, her bonds and responsibilities to feudal Japan tie her there until they are ultimately resolved.
For clarity, below is an illustrative example where isekai is applied to a non-fictional, non-parallel, non-virtual world.

* The main characters are from Earth. One day, they are abducted by Nazis from Mars (alternate "world") are brought back to their Martian base. The main characters are trapped on Mars. Their only escape is to defeat the Nazis and steal their spaceship to return to Earth (specific goal required to escape); they are left to thier own devices, with no prospect of help from Earth, and no way to contact Earth.

<name>Masaki Kenshi</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A 15 year-old, hardworking boy from Earth and the main protagonist of the series. He is the younger half-brother of http://anidb.net/ch9722 [Masaki Tenchi] and can be classified as human, but in the previous stories, Tenchi`s father was a distant descendant of Tenchi`s grandfather, a Juraian, so it is difficult to tell how he is connected to them because of all the breeding with relatives. Just like his brother, Kenshi`s kindness, strength, and courage has led most of the girls he befriends to become infatuated with him. He is an incredibly skilled swordsman (Mexiah claims that he`s better than she is), master martial artist (capable of safely catching thrown knives in mid-flight), and is a one-man army inside of a Seikijin cockpit.
Kenshi has a habit of collecting strange crystals from the hull of the Swan, as it reminds him of the same crystal-like structure from Ryo-Ohki`s spaceship form when he was young and even has a necklace made from it (until Chiaia accidentally breaks the string and replaces it with a red string, which symbolizes love much to her chagrin).
Later on, he becomes captain/ruler of the Swan and declares it an independent nation, though he is no longer allowed to dig in its hull for crystals out of a unanimous vote from the others much to his dismay. He later obtains the Tenchi-ken (lit. "Heaven and Earth Sword") from Yukine`s home village, which is made out a gigantic stone used to worship the Goddesses. Due to its heavy weight, a special weight-inhibiting ring was installed by Wahanly in order for him to wield it. His Seikijin`s unique white colour implies that he may be the legendary "Seikishi of Light" destined to save the world of Geminar. Throughout the anime, it is clear he has shown no clear signs of love interest to the women, although it is suggested he might have feelings for Yukine or Doll/Mexiah.
It is later revealed from Mexiah in episode 12 that he is the offspring of an artificial human from Geminar. It is also stated that the Geminar`s ancestors sent an artificial human to Earth in order to bring a hybrid (him) to Geminar to defeat Gaia because it was stated that the offspring of an artificial human and a summoned human are more powerful, the reason being is that they could not summon anyone during the time they were destroyed, but can send someone. In the final episode of the series, he has shown the ability to generate Light-Hawk Wings like his brother Tenchi.
His given name means "Swordsman", in reference to his sword fighting while piloting his Seikijin.

<name>Lashara Earth</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Lashara is the 12 year-old ruler of the Shitoreiyu Empire. The sudden death of her father Koyo causes her to inherit the throne, but as the series begins she is travelling away to school in the Holy Land. However, she slowly loses her position of power to Babalun as the series progresses. When not busy with other tasks, she is usually seen busily adding up her finances with an abacus, as her kingdom is currently in debt. She takes Kenshi in as a servant after he fails to follow through on an attempt to assassinate her, and along with Chiaia she kept Kenshi`s identity a secret until he showed his capabilities in battle. Lashara is the niece of Flora. It is hinted that she is most likely in love with Kenshi, but given her circumstances, she is not allowed to show such feelings to others. She shows a bit of curiosity towards the opposite sex, as shown in episodes 2 and 3 where she is shown to be a little perverted about Kenshi. Despite her mature-like behaviour, she claims that she acts this way because of her upbringing and former education, not because she was like that initially. Her personal vessel is the Swan.
Her name is a reference to Lashara Moon and Photon Earth from Kajishima`s earlier work, Photon.

<description>Chiaia is Lashara`s personal escort and bodyguard, charged with protecting her life at all costs. She also attends Holy Land Academy to complete her Seikishi training, and officially becomes a Seikishi at the end of episode 2. She is very skilled at combat, being able to imitate Kenshi`s unusual Seikijin fighting style after only seeing it once. She has a crush on Dagmyer, which causes her to ignore clues regarding his schemes until it`s too late. She frequently gets upset with both Kenshi (due to his cluelessness) and Lashara (due to her seemingly-reckless schemes), and Chiaia`s temper is one of the few things that Lashara seems to be wary of. While not happy about it, she agrees to go along with Lashara`s scheme to hide the fact that Kenshi is the Seikijin pilot that tried to kill her. Her Seikijin is pink and red with a fox-like tail equipped with a longsword. She realizes she might have feelings for Kenshi when she sees he is wearing the pendant with the red thread she made.

<description>Mexiah (in reality Doll) is one of the three artificial humans created by the Senshi Civilization with the purpose to defeat Gaia. After Gaia`s defeat, it and Doll were sent underground with Doll`s memory of the events erased. She was soon unearthed and discovered by Naua as an infant with pink hair and was adopted as Mexiah Fran, who became Chiaia`s older sister.
As Mexiah, she is Holy Land Academy`s martial arts instructor who, unlike her serious sister, indulges in her hedonistic nature and is shockingly affectionate toward Kenshi.
As Mexiah, her Seikijin is lavender with a pink lion`s mane armed with a launcher.

<description>Also known as "Wahan", she is a good friend of Lashara, a brilliant inventor, and a genius when it comes to heavy artillery and gunpowder (ironically, she can`t seem to hit her targets). While she may appear to be a 15 year-old girl, her actual age is 97 due to difference in time flow at the Barrier Workshop, where she lived prior to moving to the Swan with the others. She later invented the Kikkoujin, a steam-powered mechanoid resembling an Uchikoma with greater maneuverability than what a Seikijin would provide. Her Seikijin is brown with bull`s horns made for heavy combat. Like Lashara and Chiaia, she has feelings for Kenshi, although she usually wants to use her machines on him.

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The Dark Elf Princess of Shurifon and a member of the Junrei Guard. While she initially shows a very serious and sober personality, it is later revealed that her personality shifts based on the time of day. At certain times-such as in the early morning-she has a much more innocent and girlish personality. The reason for this is because her kind were summoned by the ancients, and her time of weakness shows that her people have not yet fully stabilized in this world. Initially she admires Kenshi`s wilderness skills, but grows to develop a romantic interest in him, even to go as far as too kiss him and then confess (even her own father suggests she should marry him). When not dealing with school-related tasks, she is nearly always accompanied by two male retainers. Her Seikijin is green and brown armed with a crossbow, and has the ability to generate the Dark Elf Field, a powerful force field that can repel any enemy that comes in range. However, using the field is extremely taxing on the user`s body.</description>

<description>Doll is one of the three artificial humans created by the Senshi Civilization with the purpose to defeat Gaia. After Gaia`s defeat, it and Doll were sent underground with Doll`s memory of the events erased. She was soon unearthed and discovered by Naua as an infant with pink hair and was adopted as Mexiah Furan, who became Chiaia`s older sister.
Doll has little regard for the importance of life, shown when she laughs while trying to kill Aura during an early encounter. Despite this, she has an attraction to Kenshi that she believes is a remnant of when Mexiah`s personality was dominant. When piloting her Seikijin, she can easily defeat any opponent except for Kenshi, the only one who can stand his ground against her. In the last episode Doll realises she loves Kenshi as does her other half Mexiah. Her Seikijin wields both a scythe, which doubles as a gun, and the Shield of Gaia, a massive and indestructible shield with a mouth capable of eating parts of her opponents, and its black color implies that she may be the legendary "Seikishi of Darkness" destined to destroy the world and Kenshi`s nemesis.
Doll bears a close resemblance to the character Neju Na Melmas from Tenchi Muyo! GXP and the character D from Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure in terms of appearance (they all share a child-like appearance) and hair color (green).

Her mother has also shown love for Kenshi, even to go as far as making Maria, Aura and Kenshi engaged.

He becomes traumatized after witnessing the berserker state of Kenshi`s Seikijin and seeing one of his own comrades fall in the process in episode 11, but eventually recovers in the episode following it. At the end, he finally acknowledges Kenshi`s skill after he loses to him in a duel.

It is later learned by the Church that Babalun wants not only Shitoreiyu and the Holy Land, but Havonia, Shurifon, and possibly the entire world of Geminar to himself. He later merged with Gaia to defeat Kenshi, only to meet his end by him and Ulyte, where it was later revealed that he is an entity created from one of the Core Crystals. A fragment of his Core Crystal was soon picked up by Dagmyer following his defeat. His personal war vessel is called the Babel, named and modeled after the Tower of Babel with an array of cannons equipped on its hull.

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Lithia is the granddaughter of the Pope of Geminar and president of the Academy`s student council. She is a bitter and sarcastic woman who often thinks of Kenshi as a "wild animal", and after the massage that was given to her (courtesy of Mexiah), she referred to him as that ever since. She suffers from extreme stress from the intense amount of work she has, and tends to pass out when she`s overworked. However, she begins to feel more relaxed after Kenshi spiked her tea with a sleep-inducing powder, though her sarcastic nature still remains. She also seems to dislike Morga, the former student council president because she does not work well with others and she is also a lunatic. Only in the last few episodes, although she still refers to Kenshi as a "wild animal", it is shown that she gets flustered around hinting she may also have feelings for him.

<description>The queen of Havonia, Maria`s mother and Lashara`s aunt. While she may appear polite and modest at first glance, she is in reality a hedonistic woman. She develops a crush on Kenshi after the massage that was given to her by Maria and Lashara. She is also shown to be a great pilot when she tested Wahanly`s Kikkoujin in the forest. She later defends the Holy Land in the invasion plotted by Babalun in a train equipped with two cannons in each car and a giant cannon hidden in the engine. She had no idea that Kenshi was a Seikishi. When she found out, it only increased her love for him, even more as to have some "one on one" time with him to Lashara`s and Maria`s dismay.
