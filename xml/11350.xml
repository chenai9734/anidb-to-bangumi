<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="326899">Well for starters, it`s really weird series. Great continuation for 2-nd season Monogatari series. It`s a must see for fans.
But. But there are Lots of idle chats, first part is filled with filler-like episodes with never-ending dialog and lack of interest, very not like whole series in terms of quality. Second part is pretty good though.
And one more BUT. But it features Oshino Ougi which pisses me of like no other character EVER in anime history.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on a series of light novels written by http://anidb.net/cr5970 [Nishio Ishin] and illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr6436 [Vofan].
During October of his third year in high school, http://anidb.net/ch8962 [Araragi Koyomi] is introduced to a transfer student named http://anidb.net/ch58986 [Oshino Ougi] by his underclassman http://anidb.net/ch8966 [Kanbaru Suruga]. Ougi wants to ask Koyomi`s opinion on a strange discovery of hers. She draws him a map of Naoetsu High School and, judging by it, there seems to be something wrong with the building`s floor plan. This observation as starting point, a tale never meant to be told begins to emerge changing Koyomi`s high school life forever. It is a story that reveals what made Araragi Koyomi who he is now. It is a story that reveals how it all began.

<name>vampire</name>
<description>A vampire is a mythological or folkloric nocturnal undead. Vampires use long fangs to penetrate the necks of people, usually young females, to drink their blood, both as a form of nourishment and to turn the targets into slaves.
In the classic vampire stories, they are thought to have no reflection in mirrors, are able to shapeshift into bats (sometimes also wolves or some form of fog), have unlimited lifespan and superhuman strength, reflexes and senses, and may only be killed by silver bullets, silver blades, a stake through the heart, fire, or exposure to sunlight; on the other hand, they cannot tolerate garlic, holy water, or Christian crosses (sometimes expanded to religious symbols in general).
In modern anime, these limitations are usually dropped, and they become far more powerful and fearsome opponents than usual. A human bitten, or sometimes even scratched, by a vampire typically becomes a slave, eventually dying as if poisoned, and becoming a vampire, ghoul, zombie, or other form of undead after death, often staying under the command of the vampire who originally bit them.</description>

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

After the events at the end of Koyomi Vamp, she was left in a weakened condition with no powers or traces of her original personality and therefore have to abandon her "Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade" name. She was named Shinobu by Meme at the beginning of Hitagi Crab, suggesting her kanji name Shinobu (忍), having "heart" (心) under "blade" (刃), matches with her original personality.</description>

<summary>Koyomi finds himself trapped in a phantom classroom with Oshino Ougi, apparently stuck there with time frozen due to the effects of another Oddity. Ougi determines that they are trapped there because of a similar incident that happened two years ago, when Koyomi was a high school freshman, and marked a turning point in his life. He recounts the incident, which involved an alleged leakage of the answers to a maths exam during a study session, and how a classmate of his, Oikura Sodachi, was determined to find the culprit. Among the suspects are those who scored highest, which included Koyomi and Sodachi themselves, and the argument is heated until the matter is put to a vote, and Sodachi is herself chosen as the culprit. She never came to school again since. Koyomi however, personally believed that it was their maths and homeroom teacher Tetsujou Komichi who was responsible, adjusting enough of the questions in her own exam to match the study session. That she herself voted for Sodachi made him lose faith in people and made him ever more withdrawn and cynical since. This allows Koyomi to leave the classroom.
The next day, Koyomi comes to class, and is warned by Hanekawa not to enter the classroom, as Sodachi has suddenly returned to school.</summary>

<summary>Koyomi recounts to Ougi how he had originally found similar letters in his shoe locker when he was in his first year of middle school, and how they intrigued him. He came to the house and the girl explained how she had sent similar letters to others and how he was the only one who responded. She began helping him study maths and this helped him to become as good at it as he eventually became, and was critical to him getting into Naoetsu High School three years later. She imposed three conditions on him that they should always meet only in the house, to keep the study sessions a secret, and that he should not probe into her life.
On the last day of summer vacation Koyomi went to the house as before and found it empty. He found an empty envelope taped to the bottom of their study table. He never saw the girl again. He tried looking for her at school to no avail. Ougi concludes that the mystery girl must be Sodachi, although he is perplexed at why she would not have reminded him of their former acquaintance when they later became classmates in high school.
Ougi explains that the reason why Sodachi invited him over for their study sessions was because her family was experiencing domestic violence and that she knew that Koyomi`s parents were police officers, and she hoped he and his parents might be able to help her family. His middle school self, however, was not able to understand this and her family eventually fell apart completely by the end of that summer.
The next day he shares Ougi`s conclusions with Hanekawa, who points out Ougi`s conclusion hinges Sodachi knowing that Koyomi`s parents were police officers, a fact which Koyomi generally keeps secret to avoid problems. He realises that his relationship with Sodachi must go further yet and there is more he still needs to remember.</summary>

<summary>Koyomi enters the classroom against Hanekawa`s advice and talks to Sodachi, who has a venomous hatred for him, and he cannot believe that it comes simply from the class meeting two years ago, as she enigmatically mentions that he has no idea what makes him what he is, as he cannot remember what was in his shoe locker the first year of middle school. She winds up stabbing him in the hand with a pencil just as Hitagi comes in, although Hanekawa is tying to stop her, and the two have a fight.
Later, Ougi accompanies him to his former middle school, and they go to his old shoe locker, which contains envelopes with his name on them. One of the envelopes contains a map, which leads to a dilapidated old house where Koyomi remembers that he explored regularly every summer during middle school, and where he met a girl.</summary>
