<description>In the context of manga and associated media, the word kodomo refers to a children`s audience roughly for the ages 12 and younger. In Japanese, the word means simply "child", and has no anime/manga-related connotations at all. It does not comprise a style or a genre per se, but rather indicates the publisher`s intended target demographic.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>In our terms, a proxy battle is a battle where humans use creatures/robots to do the fighting for them, either by commanding those creatures/robots or by simply evolving them/changing them into battle mode. Often the training aspect is also involved, or in some cases the proxies are nothing more than holographic representatives of some other variation of competition (like for example a card game). While many popular shounen anime fit under this category, it`s not limited to shounen anime.</description>

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<description>Bulbasaur is known as the Seed Pokemon. Bulbasaur looks like small, rounder turquoise dicynodon, a mammal-like reptile from the Permian Period. Bulbasaur`s most distinctive feature is the green bulb planted on its back. The plant sprouts and grows with the Pokemon. The bulb synthesizes solar rays. It can later use the energy stored for recovering itself (Synthesis) or release it in the form of a Solarbeam. Because of this Bulbasaur is usually seen napping in bright sunlight. The bulb constantly takes in nourishment from the sun, allowing both the Bulbasaur and the bulb to grow over time. It also allows them to go days without eating by using the nutrients stored in the bulb.</description>

<description>Ivysaur is known as the Seed Pokémon. While almost the same as Bulbasaur the bulb on its back has grown. Having grown much larger, the bulb forces their legs to become stronger and thicker to accommodate the weight, and makes it harder for them to stand on their hind legs. Both the Ivysaur and the bulb grow stronger and larger from sunlight. When the bulb is ready to bloom, they will spend more time lying in sunlight, and the bulb will give off a sweet scent.</description>

<description>Venusaur known as the Seed Pokémon, is the final stage in Bulbasaur evolution. The seed finally bloomed into a huge flower, vaguely resembling a Rafflesia. The flower constantly draws in sunlight for nutrition, characterized by vivid colors and a soothing aroma, and power, which is much more substantial in the summer. They are always on the move to absorb more sunlight, though they usually remain quiet and still while absorbing it. After it rains, the aroma is much stronger, which attracts other Pokémon. Female Venusaur have a seed coming out of the flower, possibly representing a pregnancy. Being the final form of Grass starter, Venusaur can learn Hyper Beam, Giga Impact and Frenzy Plant.</description>

<description>Charmander known as the Lizard Pokémon, is a fire type Pokémon. The Name comes from "Charcoal" (a material used to Create Fire) and "Salamander". They are selectable as one of three "Starter Pokémon" at the beginning of the games of the main series of Pokémon RPGs that are set primarily in the Kanto region (Pokémon Red and Blue for Game Boy, as well as their remakes Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen for Game Boy Advance). Charmander are not acquirable anywhere else in the main series aside from Pokémon Yellow. Charmander is a Fire Dinosaur-Lizard Type Pokémon. It`s name is from the words char meaning to cook and mander meaning a salamander which is a lizard-like amphibian. The end of a Charmander`s tail is alight with a flame, and the flame`s status reflects both the physical health and the emotions of the individual. If the flame were to ever go out, the Charmander would die.</description>

<description>Charizard is a dual-type Fire/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Charmeleon starting at level 36. It is the final form of Charmander. It can Mega Evolve into two forms: Mega Charizard X using Charizardite X and Mega Charizard Y using Charizardite Y. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Charizard is the game mascot of Pokémon Red and FireRed Versions.
Charizard is a draconic, bipedal Pokémon. It is primarily orange with a cream underside from the chest to the tip of its tail. It has a long neck, small blue eyes, slightly raised nostrils, and two horn-like structures protruding from the back of its rectangular head. There are two fangs visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is closed. Two large wings with blue-green undersides sprout from its back, and a horn-like appendage juts out from the third joint of each wing. A single wing-finger is visible through the center of each wing membrane. Charizard`s arms are short and skinny compared to its robust belly, and each limb has three white claws. It has stocky legs with cream-colored soles on each of its plantigrade feet. The tip of its long, tapering tail burns with a sizable flame.
Charizard has two Mega Forms. Both feature a shorter snout, white, vertical slit pupils, and a bright underside reaching the lower jaw.
As Mega Charizard X, its body and legs are more physically fit, though its arms remain thin. Its skin turns black with a sky-blue underside and soles. Two spikes with blue tips curve upward from the front and back of each shoulder, while the tips of its horns sharpen, turn blue, and curve slightly upward. Its brow and claws are larger, and its eyes are now red. It has two small, fin-like spikes under each horn and two more down its lower neck. The finger disappears from the wing membrane, and the lower edges are divided into large, rounded points. The third joint of each wing-arm is adorned with a claw-like spike. Mega Charizard X breathes blue flames out the sides of its mouth, and the flame on its tail now burns blue. It is said that its new power turns it black and creates more intense flames.
As Mega Charizard Y, it becomes sleeker in appearance but retains its normal coloration. It has three pointed horns on the back of its head, the middle of which is longer. Its snout has larger fangs and a ridge on the nose. Its neck is shorter, but its torso is thinner and longer. It features longer digitigrade feet. Its hands are less developed, with extremely shortened fingers that are no longer separated from each other. Small wings develop on its wrists, while the ones on its back become larger, lose the wing finger passing through their membrane and end up with ragged edges. The back of its tail has a large spike at the base and three smaller ones near the tip, which now burns with a longer flame. Mega Charizard Y is said to have incredible flying prowess that is greater than a jet fighter.
As Gigantamax Charizard, it becomes larger and physically fit. The lower part of its body glows white with several yellow diamonds located on the lower belly. There are also diamond-shaped spots located on the front legs. The claws located on its hand and feet become longer and sharp. The feet become longer and digitigrade, retaining small glowing soles under the forefeet. The wings are transformed into literal flame wings extending to the shoulder blade and two flames located on the horns. The colossal, flamed wings were created from the energy of Gigantamaxing. The sclera of the eyes becomes yellow. The glow of a flame can be seen in the mouth, and the teeth grow, with the lower front teeth and three teeth in the middle now protruding when the mouth is closed. The flame on the tail extends out and has three red clouds surrounding it. The flames within Gigantamax Charizard burns hotter than 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit. When it roars, the temperature can climb to even higher lengths. The wings are capable of being hotter than magma which Charizard uses to burn its opponents.
Charizard flies in search of powerful opponents to battle, and its fire will burn hotter as it gains experience. Its fiery breath is capable of melting boulders, massive glaciers, and has been known to accidentally cause forest fires. In the past, Blast Burn was its signature move. Charizard typically inhabit mountains and valleys, such as the Charicific Valley in Johto. The anime has shown that only a weak Charizard would show off its power. It also showed that Charizard can swim underwater, with Pokémon Origins further showing that the flame on the tip of the tail can still keep burning underwater. The wings of Charizard can carry to an altitude of 4,600 feet.
Charizard is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Wildfire.</description>

<description>Blastoise known as the Shellfish Pokémon, is the fully grown and developed form of the Squirtle species evolution line. In the main Pokémon game series, a Blastoise is only acquired when a Wartortle grows past experience level 36 and evolves into a Blastoise. As a Blastoise, two sections of the hefty shell open up to reveal cannon-like spouts on the Pokémon`s back that can fire pressurized water at a target with enough force that even concrete walls and thick steel can be punctured. The spouts are also very accurate, since a Blastoise can strike distant tin cans with the water from its spouts!</description>

<description>Caterpie known as the Worm Pokémon, are larval Pokémon found in the wild early in the Kanto and Johto regions. In main series Pokémon games set in these regions, Caterpie are among the earliest and easiest Pokémon species caught by players, as they are very weak. They can be evolved into their cocoon-like Metapod form and eventually into the butterfly-like Butterfree form. Caterpie in the wild employ biological adaptations to survive, much like real caterpillars, in that their green bodies are useful for camouflage in foliage, their eyes are patterned to scare away predators, their suction-cup feet allow them to climb any surface, and the osmeterium on their heads can project a horrid stench to repel predators. It bears a resemblance to the spicebush swallowtail caterpillar.
In the anime, Caterpie as the first Pokémon Ash ever caught in his trainer career, and it eventually evolved into a Butterfree and was later traded for a Raticate on the S.S. Saint Anne but is traded back later in the episode. Ash releases it later so it could mate with a pink Butterfree.</description>

<description>Metapod known as the Cocoon Pokémon, are pupal Pokémon found in the wild early in the Kanto and Johto regions, of which its larval form is the caterpillar-like Caterpie. In main series Pokémon games set in these regions, Metapod are among the earliest and easiest Pokémon species acquired by players, either by catching one in the wild or training a Caterpie past experience level 7 and evolving it into a Metapod. They can evolve into the butterfly-like Butterfree when raised past experience level 10. A Metapod`s exterior is regularly hardened to protect its soft and tender innards while undergoing metamorphosis to eventually become a Butterfree. To conserve energy for this event, the Metapod barely moves.</description>

<description>Butterfree is a dual-type Bug/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Metapod starting at level 10. It is the final form of Caterpie. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Butterfree resembles a vaguely anthropomorphic butterfly with a purple body. Unlike true insects, it only has two body segments and four light blue legs. The upper pair of legs resembles small, three-fingered hands, while the lower pair resembles long, digit-less feet. Butterfree has two black antennae, a light blue snout with two fangs underneath, and large, red compound eyes. Its two pairs of wings are white with black venation. Two oval scales on a female Butterfree`s lower wings are black, but they are white on a male.
As Gigantamax Butterfree, its size increases to gigantic length with altered look. The wings and its pattern changes to light and dark green color with white. The antennae change to bright green and extends to the point where the tip bends, and three red clouds surround it. The eyes changes to bright glowing red. A fur-like circle is attached to both the wings and back of Butterfree. Several green scales can be seen floating around Butterfree, which are its most effective weapons, capable of releasing paralysis, poisoning, or sleep. The massive wings are powerful enough to lift a 10-ton truck through a simple flap. The wind it generates can scatter poisonous scales throughout the area, making it dangerous to be near it.
Butterfree`s wings are covered with poisonous powders that fall off continuously as it flies. It will defend Caterpie from bird Pokémon using this powder. This powder also repels water, enabling it to gather honey even in the rain. Butterfree will roam up to six miles (ten kilometers) from its nest in search of honey, which it carries with the hairs of its legs. Sometimes it has territorial disputes with Cutiefly over fields of flowers. It also consumes sap from trees pierced by Heracross, as seen in the anime. Butterfree is found in temperate forests and jungles, but it has also been observed flying near the ocean as part of its migratory breeding pattern.
Gigantamax Butterfree is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Befuddle.</description>

<description>Pidgey, known as the Tiny Bird Pokémon, is a bird-like Pokémon, whose original name in the English beta version of Pokémon Red and Blue was "Pidge". Pidgey was first introduced in the United States in Red and Blue. They are one of the first wild Pokémon that players encounter in those games. Pidgey does not like to fight, and will use its wings to stir up clouds of sand in an attempt to distract its would-be opponent and escape. Pidgey also uses this technique to bring its preferred prey of small insects into the open. Pidgey seems to possess magnetoception, as it is capable of returning to its nest from any location without fail.
Pidgey also appeared in the first television episode, Pokémon, I Choose You!, when the main character, Ash Ketchum, attempts to catch one. He fails when it uses its Gust attack to blow him away and escapes. Afterwards, it uses its Sand Attack to blind Ash, allowing it to get away.</description>

<description>Pidgeotto, known as the Bird Pokémon, is a bird-like Pokémon, is a larger and stronger form that Pidgey takes when it gains enough experience. In the main Pokémon game series, a Pidgeotto is only acquired when a Pidgey grows past experience level 18 and evolves into a Pidgeotto. A Pidgeotto is extremely territorial, generally claiming a large area with its nest built in the center. Full of vitality, it constantly patrols its territory, mercilessly attacking intruders. They fly about in circular patterns while hunting, and can spot the movements of their prey on the ground no matter how high they fly. The Pidgeotto attacks with its wickedly sharp talons and carries its prey, including Exeggcute and Magikarp, back to its nest from as far as 60 miles away - or more.
Pidgeotto was the second Pokémon Ash caught in the beginning of his career, eventually evolving into Pidgeot.</description>

<description>Pidgeot, known as the Bird Pokémon, is a bird-like Pokémon, whose original name in the English beta version of Pokémon Red and Blue was "Pidgeott", is the fully grown and developed form of the Pidgey species evolution line. In the main Pokémon game series, a Pidgeot is only acquired when a Pidgeotto grows past experience level 36 and is evolved into a Pidgeot. Pidgeot are large, powerful birds admired for their glossy plumage and their battling ability. With their powerful chest muscles at work, Pidgeot can flap their wings fast enough to whip up gusts of winds to rival tornadoes. Pidgeot are very aerodynamic, capable of soaring to an altitude of 3300 feet and reaching speeds of up to Mach 2. Like Pidgeotto, Pidgeot feed on Magikarp by swooping from the sky and snatching them out of the water with their talons. Pidgeot appear very similar to Pidgeotto, so much so that one has been easily mistaken for the other, even by official sources.
In the Pokémon anime, Ash`s Pidgeotto evolves into a Pidgeot near the end of the Kanto saga, and remained in Pallet Town to watch over a flock of Pidgey and Pidgeotto while Ash went off to the Orange Islands.</description>

They make their nests almost anywhere and as extreme omnivores eat anything they can scavenge. A Rattata`s fangs grow continuously throughout its lifespan, so it whittles them down to a comfortable size by gnawing on hard objects.</description>

Its webbed feet allow it to swim as it hunts prey, and its fangs are tough enough to topple concrete buildings.</description>

<description>Spearow is a small, bird Pokémon with short wings and a small, stubby beak. It is noted for being frail, but it makes up for that with its "Mirror Move" ability. It eats insects in grassy areas by flushing them out with its wings, and plucking at them with its beak. Its wings aren`t good for long distance travel or high flying, but it is able to fly at high speeds by flapping its wings very rapidly. It is very territorial, constantly buzzing about and calling with a loud cry that can be heard from half a mile away. It serves to scare away predators and keep in touch with other Spearow, which usually is used to alert them of danger. The golden spearow has golden wings and a golden beak, it also has a lighter color of brown feathers.</description>

It has a large wingspan; elongated neck; and thin, long beak; all characteristics being a radical departure from its short-winged, stubby-beaked pre-evolved form Spearow. Fearow uses its great wings to catch air currents and effortlessly glide over large distances for as long as a day without having to land or rest. It flies high into the sky, and swoops down at its prey. By using a combination of its neck and beak, it has a large reach, allowing it to pluck bugs from the ground or easily pluck prey from soil or water as it swoops down. If it senses danger, it avoids it if possible.</description>

<description>Pikachu is an Electric-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Pichu when leveled up with high friendship and evolves into Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone. However, the starter Pikachu in Pokémon Yellow will refuse to evolve into Raichu unless it is traded and evolved on another save file.
In Alola, Pikachu will evolve into Alolan Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone.
It also has a Gigantamax form.
Pikachu is popularly known as the mascot of the Pokémon franchise and a major representative of Nintendo`s collective mascots.
It is also the game mascot and starter Pokémon of Pokémon Yellow and Pokémon: Let`s Go, Pikachu!. It has made numerous appearances on the boxes of spin-off titles.
Pikachu is also the starter Pokémon in Pokémon Rumble Blast and Pokémon Rumble World.
Pikachu is a short, chubby rodent Pokémon. It is covered in yellow fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back. It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch for electricity storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is a patch of brown fur. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs.
The anime has shown that wild Pikachu live in groups in forested areas. Pikachu communicate amongst themselves using squeaks and tail-shaking as friendly gestures. In the anime, Alolan Pikachu are known to greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Electricity can be used to receive and send messages with each other, as well as other Electric Pokémon species. It raises its tail to check its surroundings and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups grow, they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. Pikachu forages for Berries, which it roasts with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that Pikachu inhabits a location is patches of burnt grass. It has been observed eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment.
Pikachu charges itself while sleeping overnight, though stress and a lack of sleep can affect this. It is able to release electric discharges of varying intensity. Pikachu has been known to build up energy in its glands, which it will need to discharge to avoid complications. It is also able to release energy through its tail, which acts as a grounding rod, as well as recharging fellow Pikachu with electric shocks. Pikachu can also electrify itself to use its signature move Volt Tackle.
Pikachu has three alternate forms: one, the Cosplay Pikachu appeared exclusively in Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. It is always female, has a black heart-shaped spot at the end of its tail, and can be dressed in any of five outfits corresponding to the five Contest conditions. The second form is Pikachu in a cap, which debuted as an event-exclusive Pokémon in Generation VII. It is always male and has seven variants, each wearing one of Ash`s hats from the anime. In addition to these two forms, many other Pikachu variants have appeared in various media. The last, Partner Pikachu is the Pokémon the player starts with in Pokémon: Let`s Go, Pikachu!. This Pikachu can be either gender, has higher base stats, and has access to moves that normal Pikachu do not.
As Gigantamax Pikachu, it becomes larger and chubbier. Its tail becomes longer and stores all of the electricity it generates, causing it to glow a bright yellow and enabling it to become as powerful as a lightning strike. Its power is equal to that a power plant; however, it is difficult to use it in peoples` homes since Pikachu can only remain in its Gigantamax form for a short time.
Pikachu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Catastropika, while Pikachu in a cap has its own exclusive Z-Move, 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt. Partner Pikachu is the only Pokémon capable of using Zippy Zap, Floaty Fall, Splishy Splash, and the Partner Power, Pika Papow. Pikachu is the only Pokémon capable of using the Light Ball item. Gigantamax Pikachu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Volt Crash.</description>

It also has a white underbelly, brown stripes on its back, and yellow cheeks, in contrast to Pikachu`s red cheeks and Pichu`s pink cheeks. In the main Pokemon game series, a Raichu is only acquired when an item called a Thunderstone is applied to a Pikachu so that it evolves into a Raichu. Raichu can only learn moves in the Pikachu stage, so the only way to make Raichu learn more moves is by using a TM. Raichu can generate 10,000 or even 100,000 volts of electricity, enough to knock out Pokemon several times its size, such as a Dragonite, as stated in the anime. Raichu`s name is a portmanteau of the kanji 雷 rai, meaning thunder, or lightning bolt, and chuu, which is the Japanese onomatopoeia for a mouse`s squeak.</description>

<description>Vulpix is a fox-like creature with six curled tails, based on the Japanese fox spirit kitsune. Most commonly female, Vulpix are especially known for being beautiful. As Vulpix undergo Pokemon evolution, their red fur turns pale yellow and they grow three extra tails. Vulpix usually have a friendly, if not spoiled, temperament. Because of the flame in their bodies, when the temperature outside increases, they let flames out of their mouths to prevent their body temperature from getting too hot. In the wild, Vulpix will feign injury to escape from more powerful predators.
During the first season of the Pokemon anime, Vulpix appears often as one of Brock`s Pokemon. It was given to him by a girl named Susie who felt she could not take care of it well. Brock, who felt he was only "babysitting", gives it back to Susie in the season four episode called "Beauty and the Breeder".
Its Japanese name, Rokon is a portmanteau of six (六, roku) and kon (from kon kon, an onomatopoeic word describing the bark of a fox), or an alternate reading of the Japanese word for kitsune (狐, kitsune), meaning fox - in this case, the reading is ko (こ). Its English name may have been derived from the scientific name for a group of foxes, Vulpes.</description>

Ninetales is highly intelligent and able to understand human speech, but also vengeful; Ninetales have been recorded as putting a 1,000 year curse on anyone who grabs one of their tails, which is a focus of the plot in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team. They, along with Vulpix, have keen senses of smell, hearing, and sight. It can only be obtained by using a Fire Stone on a Vulpix. Its Japanese name Kyuukon comes from a combination of the Japanese number 9, kyu, and the sound of a barking fox.
In the anime, Ash and the gang find an abandoned mansion and Brock is deceived by a Ninetales, whose master strongly resembles Brock.
Since it has nine tails, the Pokemon`s name is very commonly misspelled as "Ninetails." Even the Game Boy Color port of the Pokemon Trading Card game uses this misspelling.</description>

<description>Jigglypuff, known as the "Balloon" species of Pokémon, are characterized by putting their enemies to sleep by singing a lullaby. Before beginning to sing, they mesmerize the opponent with their soft, glowing eyes, and if they inflate themselves, they can sing for longer periods of time. They can easily adjust the wavelength of their voices to that of the brain waves of a sleeping being, allowing for their pleasing melody to put its audience to sleep. They sing without pausing to take a breath, so if the opponent is resistant to sleeping, they potentially run out of air.
In the Pokémon anime series, Jigglypuff is a recurring character who aspires to be a great singer after the inspiration of Ash Ketchum and company. Unfortunately for it, every potential audience falls asleep before the song finishes. Jigglypuff does not usually choose an appropriate time to sing and has been a hazard many times, causing Ash Ketchum and his companions to often find themselves running away from Jigglypuff. It keeps with it a black marker, its "microphone," and uses it to scribble on anyone who falls asleep while it`s performing.
Its desire to have someone listen to the entire song was finally satisfied when it encountered a Whismur, who was able to stay awake due to its Soundproof ability.
Also, Jigglypuff`s Japanese name, Purin, translates into "pudding".</description>

Wigglytuff`s eyes are always covered by a thin layer of tears, so that if any dust gets into Wigglytuff`s eyes, it is quickly cried away. In the games, Wigglytuff`s fur is described to be "sublime", so much so that if two of them come into close contact with each other, they are difficult to separate. In the television series, Wigglytuff is generally accepted as the most powerful Pokemon.</description>

At night, it will come out and hunt for fruit or Venomoth, or it sucks blood. The female`s fangs are smaller than the male`s.
In the anime, Brock catches a Zubat before entering Mt. Moon. Since then it has evolved to Golbat and then into Crobat. Crobat was given to Forest, with Onix and Geodude by Brock, becoming a Gym Leader.</description>

Golbat is a fierce, nocturnal Pokémon, residing in the darkness of caves, and is most active in the pitch black of night, especially if the moon is in its new phase. It is widely known and despised for its feeding behavior: Sucking fresh blood from living things in large quantities. Once it has found a living target, it attacks in a stealthy manner, often striking without warning from behind, to harshly bite down on its prey with its four sharp fangs strong enough to puncture the hide of any animal-like Pokemon, however strong the hide might be. It then proceeds to drink ten ounces of blood instantly. Golbat enjoys blood so much that it does not want to stop, even though a lot of blood will weigh it down enough so that, if it is able to even fly afterwards, it flies clumsily.
Surprisingly, after each attack and feeding sequence, Golbat`s own blood type changes into that of its victim. Once it strikes, it will not stop draining energy from the victim even if it gets too heavy to fly. Like Zubat, the female`s fangs are smaller than the male`s.</description>

<description>Oddish are a weed-like Pokémon found in all regions throughout the Pokémon world. (with the exception of Pokémon Blue and Pokémon Leaf Green) Oddish looks like a small animated onion/turnip plant with a rounded body. Its body is blue or purple with two small feet and red eyes. On top of its head grows a large clump of 5 long green blades of grass. Its name likely came from the words "odd" and "radish".
Oddish is a nocturnal Pokémon, using moonlight rather than the sun`s rays for photosynthesis. During the day, Oddish avoids the sun`s heat and brightness by burying itself into the earth, leaving only the leaves on top of its head visible above ground. In this way it disguises itself as a plant, misdirecting its carnivorous diurnal predators.
While buried, Oddish nourishes itself by absorbing nutrients from the soil using its feet, which are said to temporarily change into a root-like structure for this purpose.
Oddish has been known to use its leaves as hands, such as one who used this to climb a rope net and tried to fly like a Hoppip.
If anyone pulls at Oddish`s leaves and tries to uproot it while it is buried underground, Oddish will react by shrieking in a cute, high-pitched voice. This mirrors the behavior of the legendary mandrake in a similar situation, although it seems that Oddish`s squeaks do not have the same dire consequences as a mandrake`s.</description>

<description>Gloom is a flower-like Pokémon that is a larger and stronger evolution of Oddish. Gloom are obtained when an Oddish gains enough experience to grow up to level 21. Gloom can also be found in most grassy areas of most regions.
The fluid that oozes from its mouth is a sweet nectar that is used to attract prey. Once the prey is attracted, the nectar will cling to the prey, trapping it. The nectar mostly attracts prey that lack a sense of smell, as the nectar smells horrible.
As well as its nectar, the pistil of Gloom`s flower smells incredibly foul; it can be smelled from over a mile away. It has been found that approximately 1 in 1,000 people enjoy the scent that Gloom emits. Those that don`t enjoy the smell have been known to faint upon smelling it. When Gloom is faced with danger, the stench worsens. If it is feeling calm or secure, it does not release the horrible aroma. Oddly enough, people have been known to sniff Gloom, just to get a reaction. This is similar to real world drug addiction.
It is said to widely shower its attacks; with moves such as Stun Spore, Poison Powder, and Sleep Powder, it has the ability to cause status problems on its foes. It is also notable that Gloom has two evolved forms (from the second generation onwards), Vileplume and Bellossom. Unlike other Pokémon that evolve via level, Gloom will not evolve until it is exposed to an evolution stone; a Leaf Stone will make a Vileplume, while a Sun Stone produces a Bellossom.</description>

<description>Vileplume is a huge flower-like Pokémon that is a larger and stronger evolution of Gloom. Vileplumes can be obtained by using a Leaf Stone with a Gloom.
Vileplume is known for its extremely offensive stench that comes from its large red flower. Vileplume uses this stench in battle, catching its foes off guard when they start to back away from the horrible smell. However, Vileplume`s flower can actually be a hindrance in battle due to it being very heavy and bulky. Due to of its weight, Vileplume walks very slowly, and it often must use its hands to help support the flower. Vileplume can be found in forests and they like to stay low to the ground. When they sleep, their huge petals droop over their head and they blend in more with the plants around them. They also release toxic, dense pollen into the air in this position so animals don`t go near them. At night, they sometimes gather together to perform odd rituals - during this time they release toxic pollen to deter intruders. The white markings on this flower are larger in the female than in the male. Paul uses Vileplume to battle Tyrogue, but his Vileplume is useless for Fighting-type Pokemon.</description>

Paras is born with tiny spores covering their body, which grow as the Pokémon feeds, called tochukaso mushrooms. It is noted in that the relationship between the host and the mushrooms is a symbiotic relationship: the mushrooms will sap energy from the host, causing the Paras to continuously burrow underground in forest areas to gnaw on tree roots, since the tochukaso draws most of the energy from the roots. In return, the mushrooms defend the host by spraying toxic spores at enemies. The mushrooms themselves have strong healing properties, and are valued for their life extending properties.</description>

<description>Golduck are large bipedal ducks, with blue skin and strong, webbed appendages that given them the ability to swim at high speeds. Due to their bluish color and webbed hands and feet, Golduck are sometimes mistaken for Kappa. They have more formidable psychic powers than the Psyduck they evolve from, and they lose the headaches that they constantly suffer from. The gem on their heads glows when they use psychic powers as well as when they swim at full speed.
They live in fresh-water lakes and rivers, where they are seen gracefully swimming, especially at dusk. As the fastest swimmers out of all Pokémon, they can out swim even the most athletic of humans, though they often train with swimmers. As they are able to swim in severe storms, they are sometimes found rescuing people lost at sea from danger.</description>

It is capable of living in or out of water; in order to live out of water, it must sweat to keep its body slimy. prefers to live underwater in ponds where there is less danger.
In battle, it subtly undulates the spiral-shape on its belly to put the foe to sleep, using a type of hypnosis. It is also capable of easily escaping the grasp of foes due to its greasy skin. Poliwhirl`s spiral goes in the opposite direction of Poliwag`s. Poliwhirl`s mouth is no longer visible after evolution, but it is concluded that it moved to the center of its spiral, since it now sprays water from there.
In the Pokémon anime, Misty had a Poliwhirl in the Johto series, which later evolved into Politoed. Red owns one in the Pokémon adventures which eventually it evolves into a Poliwrath.</description>

<description>Abra (Hocus in English-language beta versions of Pokémon Red and Blue) is a vaguely fox-like psychic Pokémon, which is always depicted to be sleeping in a sitting position. The brown upper torso seems to be armored and it appears to wear two pauldrons.
Abra are described as sleeping eighteen hours a day to conserve their psychic abilities. They also constantly use teleportation while asleep; changing their location once an hour, teleporting away when they sense danger or are attacked, and creating illusory copies of themselves. This constant use of teleportation is Abra`s defining characteristic in the video games.
In the Pokémon anime, Abra appears several times, first in Episode 21, Abra and the Psychic showdown, where it is used by the Saffron City gym leader and evolves into Kadabra. Abra has also appeared in the episode Psychic Vs. Ghost! Midnight Showdown, where he appears to have a main role in the episode.</description>

<description>Machoke evolves from Machop at Level 28. An interesting fact about Machoke is when seen in its "shiny" version, it shares a striking resemblance to that of The Hulk, being green in color.
Machoke`s name is a portmanteau of macho, meaning tough, and choke. The Japanese name Goriky is a pun on the Japanese word for superhuman strength (剛力) or godlike strength. Its name was originally "Kong-Fuu" in beta English versions of Red and Blue, which is a reference to Kung fu. Its signature moves include submission, cross chop and dynamic punch.
Machoke, along with its evolved form Machamp, is nicknamed as one of the bodybuilders of the Pokémon world, due to its humanoid appearance, huge muscles and the fact that it wears black speedos, and the belt round its waist makes it look similar to a wrestler (which is most probably what the pokemon was based on). The belt is known as a "Power Save" belt, which keeps Machoke`s power under control and helps to regulate its motions. The explanations of the belt`s purpose vary, but is quoted that because it is so dangerous, no one has ever attempted to remove it.
Machoke has had relatively few anime appearances, most of which were in the Jouto region, most notably in "Machoke, Machoke Man!", in which Machoke was Chuck`s signature Pokemon, and shared a very close bond with its trainer, who sparred and even used submission on during training. Machoke also appear as employed heavy lifters and construction workers, and can also be seen in the beginning of the games Pokémon Saphire and Ruby where a group of Machoke are seen carrying furniture into the players home, which are replaced by Vigoroth in pokemon Emerald.
Despite being measured at 4`11" in the Pokedex, whenever Machoke appear in the anime, they are always around the same height, or taller than, an adult male.</description>

<description>Machamp is a Fighting-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Machoke when traded. It is the final form of Machop. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Machamp is a large, humanoid Pokémon with four well-muscled arms. It has bluish gray skin, red eyes, and pale yellow lips. On its head, there are three brown ridges right above its eyes. It has two arms on each side of its body: a pair located in the normal position, and another pair directly above that attaches on the top of the shoulders. It has black markings that resemble briefs and wears golden power-save belt that resembles a championship belt. Its legs have considerable muscle tone, and its feet have two toes each.
Machamp punches extremely fast, throwing five hundred punches a second. With only one hand, it can move a mountain. Because of its four arms, it can hit from a multitude of angles and pin all of its foe`s limbs at once. Its arms also allow it to attack and defend simultaneously. The four arms react faster before Marchamp think. However, it has poor dexterity, and cannot handle delicate work without its arms becoming tangled. It is a rash Pokémon that rushes into action without forethought. Being the result of an evolution via trading, Machamp is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in the mountains. In the past, it claimed Low Kick, Vital Throw, and Strength as signature moves.
As Gigantamax Machamp, it has become larger with several changes. Its blueish-gray skin becomes darker. The middle ridge located on head becomes longer compare to the other two. All three ridges are also darker now. The neck extends with black markings. The fours fists are now colored dark orange with yellow lines connecting to two orange spots on each arm. The golden belt extends with several more dots. The P in the middle of the belt is colored white and connected to a single yellow circle with nothing in between. The black markings on its leg extend to the legs but stopping near the ankle.
Due to Gigantamaxing, the arms are filled with power, the punches it makes can hit as hard as bomb blasts. There is a legend where Gigantamax Machamp saved a large ship that was in trouble before bringing it to a port.
Gigantamax Machamp is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Chi Strike.</description>

<description>Bellsprout is a carnivorous, flower-like Pokémon, hunting small insects with blinding agility despite its skinny body. It is said to ensnare its prey in its vines and devour it, and can also spit a highly corrosive fluid that can melt even iron. Bellsprout`s preferred habitat is warm and humid climates, since it can absorb more moisture from the ground by planting its root-like feet. In battle, Bellsprout can take advantage of its flexibility to bend and sway its way out of the range of its opponent`s attacks, no matter how powerful they may be.
In the video games, Bellsprout is commonly found among grassy routes, and is used by many Trainers who favor the Grass-type. In Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, the Sprout Tower in Violet City is dedicated to Bellsprout.
Bellsprout has appeared numerous times in the anime series, most notably in "The Fourth Round Rumble," where Ash battled one during the Indigo League. He eventually defeated it with Muk.</description>

<description>Weepinbell is a bell-like Pokémon that resembles its pre-evolution Bellsprout, but without the vines and leaves. Instead of walking, it hops along or hangs on to tree branches and vines using the large hook on its rear end. Weepinbell immobilizes its enemies by using Poisonpowder and Acid. It will swallow anything that moves and digest it within its stomach, and produces a neutralizing fluid to keep from being affected by its own strong stomach acids. If its prey is larger than it, it will first use sharp leaves to slice it up before eating.
Players can obtain a Weepinbell by catching it in the wild, evolving Bellsprout upon reachng level 21, or Snagging a Shadow Weepinbell in Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness. In Pokémon Ranger, enemy Weepinbell can swallow the protagonist whole, knocking him or her back to the beginning of the area.
Weepinbell has appeared in relatively few episodes in the Pokémon anime. It first appeared in "The School of Hard Knocks," and later when Celadon City Gym Leader Erika battled Ash with one. James` Victreebel was also briefly seen as a Weepinbell.</description>

<description>Victreebel is a carnivorous Pokémon based on the pitcher plant. It lulls its prey with a sweet, honey-like scent, and also the vine on its head (which waves as if it were an animal) before digesting it with powerful stomach acids that can even dissolve bone. Normally, its prey are bugs, but it has been known to attack and consume small animals. Victreebel cannot be caught in the wild in any of the Pokémon video games; it must be evolved from Weepinbell with a Leaf Stone.
In the anime, James of Team Rocket had a Weepinbell which evolved into Victreebel in the episode "The Breeding Center Secret." As a running gag, it usually tried to eat him as soon as it emerged from its Poké Ball (this tradition of James`s Grass-type Pokémon hurting him was continued by Cacnea in the Advanced Generation series, and Carnivine in the Diamond and Pearl series). While most Pokèmon speak in a vocabulary consisting of its own name, Victreebel, like Lapras, communicates through loud, high-pitched shrieks.</description>

<description>Tentacool (メノクラゲ, Menokurage?) is an aquatic Pokémon based on the box jellyfish. It drifts aimlessly wherever the ocean currents take it, sometimes ending up in shallow waters where it may be accidentally caught in fishing lines. Tentacool may also end up stuck on beaches when low tide comes; since its body is largely composed of water, it will shrivel up, risking death from dehydration if it stays out of the sea for too long. Tentacool has two main weapons. At the tips of its tentacles are toxic feelers, which it uses to stab anything it touches with stinging acid. Due to its excellent camouflage in the water, Tentacool can often remain undetected by swimmers right up to the moment it stings them. Tentacool`s gelatinous, watery body can also absorb sunlight and refract it within, producing beam energy it shoots from its crystal-like eyes.
Tentacool is available in all Pokémon games to date. It is extremely common, especially while surfing on sea routes, and is in almost every single body of water.
In the anime, Tentacool was featured in the episode "Tentacool and Tentacruel" in which a raging mob of the titular Pokémon attacked the Porta Vista resort. The episode was banned after the attacks on September 11, 2001 due to its scenes depicting Tentacools and Tentacruels destroying buildings at a seaside resort.</description>

<description>"Tentacruel" is probably a portmanteau of "tentacle", the reason for which is obvious, and the adjective "cruel", referring to its personality. The name may have something to do with the deep-sea jellyfish called Tentaculata. Its name was originally going to be Man-O-War, which refers to the Portuguese man o` war. The Japanese name, "Dokukurage," is a portmanteau, of 毒 doku (poison) and 水母 kurage (jellyfish). It resembles its pre-evolution Tentacool to a small degree - the "head" of Tentacool has now been made into a hat-like shape on top of a black orb containing its eyes and two very large hooks which resembles a long nose. Also, unlike Tentacool, it has up to 80 tentacles, most of which are hidden, leaving up to 14 exposed.</description>

Geodude most frequently are found in fields and on mountains. People step or trip on them from time to time, mistaking them for rocks. Its arms are so strong that it can use them to climb mountains. Rhyperior sometimes accidentally shoot Geodude from their cannon-like arms. Geodudes are one of the few Pokémon to have appeared in every Pokémon game.
In the video games, Geodude is commonly found inside caves and mountains, and sometimes appears when Rock Smash is used. Geodude are also found in the Nintendo 64 game Pokémon Snap, hanging from mountainsides by their arms. In the Super Smash Bros. Melee battlefield "Poké Floats", a Geodude is the last float the fighters ride on before returning to the Squirtle float.
Geodude is a recurring character in the Pokémon anime. It first appeared in the fifth episode, "Showdown in Pewter City," used by Gym Leader Brock to battle Ash. Brock became a travel companion of Ash and owned Geodude for the first five seasons. Navel Island Gym Leader Danny and Rustboro City Gym Leader Roxanne have also used Geodude. In the anime, Geodude is able to levitate above the ground.
Geodude`s name comes from the word "Geode" as in a rock with a sparkly inside, and "Dude," usually used to describe a certain kind of male person.</description>

<description>Ponyta is a Fire-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves into Rapidash starting at level 40.
In Galar, Ponyta has a Psychic-type regional form. It evolves into Galarian Rapidash starting at level 40.
Ponyta is an equine Pokémon with cream-colored fur. It has brown eyes and triangular ears with reddish interiors. Yellow and reddish-orange flames form its mane and tail. The mane forms a short crest on top of its head and a short strip down its back to its tail. Additional flames are present behind its elbows and knees. The fire appears about an hour after hatching. It has four long legs, each ending in a single, gray hoof. These hooves are said to be harder than diamonds.
Ponyta has extraordinary jumping abilities and is capable of leaping tall buildings in a single bound. However, a newborn Ponyta is a weak runner and is actually barely able to stand. It gradually strengthens its legs and becomes faster by chasing after its parents. In the anime, it is shown that Ponyta can control its flames so that its rider is not burned by them. Ponyta live in grasslands, on plains, or anywhere that it can run freely.
In the Galar region, Ponyta has adapted to forests by being exposed to the life energy from it. It has chalk-white fur; long, purple-and-blue, cloudy fur that is also on top of its dark-purple hooves; purple eyes with light-blue irises; and a purple-and-white horn on top of its forehead. Galarian Ponyta can absorb the life energy located in the atmosphere and store it in its mane, which will then become more colorful and potentially release a shining glow if there is a lot of energy to use. The small horn contains a healing power. Ponyta can heal any slight wounds with a few rubs from its horn. By looking it the eyes of a person, it can read the contents of the heart. Should Ponyta find any evil, it will promptly go back into hiding.</description>

In Galar, Rapidash has a Psychic/Fairy-type regional form. It evolves from Galarian Ponyta starting at level 40.
Rapidash is an equine Pokémon with cream-colored fur and a pointed horn on its forehead. It has small, red eyes and triangular ears with reddish interiors. Yellow and reddish-orange flames stream from the back of its head to form a long, flowing mane. A short version of the mane trails down its back to its equally fiery tail. Flames are also present on its fetlocks. It has slender legs, each with a single black hoof.
Rapidash is a very agile Pokémon. It runs at about 150 mph (240 km/h), chasing everything that moves in hopes of racing it. With incredible acceleration, it reaches its top speed in only ten steps. At full gallop, its hooves barely touch the ground. The faster Rapidash goes, the longer the swaying flames of its mane will become. At an all-out gallop, its blazing mane sparkles, a feature which is said to enhance its beautiful appearance. Rapidash lives in grasslands, but it can also be seen on mountains in Pokémon Snap.</description>

In Galar, Slowpoke has a pure Psychic-type regional form, introduced in Pokémon Sword and Shield`s 1.1.0 patch. It will evolve into Galarian Slowbro using an item found on the Isle of Armor or Galarian Slowking using an item found in the Crown Tundra.
Slowpoke is a pink Pokémon that resembles a cross between a salamander and a hippopotamus. It has vacant eyes that never seem focused, curled ears, and a rounded, tan muzzle. It has four legs, each of which ends in a single white claw. Its long, tapering tail has a white tip. This tail drips a sweet, sappy substance that is attractive to many species of fish. Slowpoke uses the tail as a fishing lure. The tail often breaks off, but it will grow back. In Alola, its tail is often dried and used in home cooked stews.
Slowpoke has notoriously dim intellect, and often forgets what it was doing. It takes a long time to respond to outside stimuli. For example, it can take up to five seconds to process pain and can take an entire day to notice when its tail has been bitten. Slowpoke is commonly found at the water`s edge. In some places, it is believed that Slowpoke`s yawn causes rain. This Pokémon is worshiped in those areas.
In Galar, Slowpoke gains yellow markings on its forehead and tail.</description>

<description>Slowbro is a slow and dopey Pokémon that evolves from Slowpoke. Its name a portmanteau of slow (as in "slow-witted") and bro (as in "brother", probably relating to the fraternal relationship it shares with the Shellder on its tail). Slowpoke becomes Slowbro when a Shellder clamps down on its tail, yet it is so slow and dopey it is sometimes unaware of the change until it gets out of the water. Its Japanese name is most likely derived from 宿借り yadokari (hermit crab). The Shellder which bites on its tail sucks on the aforementioned syrup, and so it is hard to remove. Also toxins which leak from the bite pass into Slowbro, which numbs its immunity to pain even more. The relationship between Slowpoke and Shellder is symbiotic; being attached to the Slowpoke enables the Shellder to travel on land, whereas the weight of the Shellder on its tail enables the Slowpoke to walk on its hind legs, freeing the use of its arms.</description>

It floats through the air, through a sort of electromagnetic antigravity field generated by the two magnets on either side of its body. When defending itself in the wild or fighting in a Pokémon battle at the orders of a Pokémon trainer, it can also generate powerful electric shocks. Magnemite consumes electricity, so they`re attracted to power lines and electronic gadgets. Magnemite tend to crowd around generators and power plants, and an individual Magnemite might be attracted to someone with a pocket radio or a Pokégear.
Despite their mechanical appearance, lack of gender, and alien tendencies, Magnemite are living things; they are not built, they feel the need to eat, and they have something similar to a mating urge. A trio of Magnemite may come together to create their evolved form, Magneton.</description>

<description>Magneton is composed of 3 Magnemite linked together by a strong magnetic force. It levitates on an electromagnetic anti-gravity field like its pre-evolution, Magnemite. Its electromagnetic powers are so strong that it has been known to cause total blackouts in cities in which it gathers.</description>

<description>Dewgong`s name is derived from the real animal which has a similar, but much larger, body: the dugong. In the beta versions of Red/Blue, Dewgong`s name was originally going to be Manaty, a reference to the manatee. The Pokémon first appears in the arsenal of a trainer named "Allison" outside of Saffron City, who cites her similar body fat percentage as a reason for her choosing to utilize the Water/Ice type Pokémon.</description>

<description>Muk is a living manifestation of sludge and waste. Muk thrives in toxic waste and garbage. It inhabits any polluted area; including abandoned factories, garbage dumps and sewers. It is said that its smell is comparable to that of reeking kitchen garbage, especially during hot summers. Muk itself is also a source of pollution. As Muk slides across the ground, it leaves behind a trail of highly poisonous sludge. Muk and Grimer are known for traveling into water and polluting it and killing plants with their sludge. Muk could be considered antagonistic of Suicune, a Pokémon with the ability to purify dirty or polluted water. It can also be considered antagonistic of Celebi, which can bring dead plants back to life.
In the anime, Ash and friends encounter a horde of Grimer, which is led by a Muk. After a group of Magnemits and Magnetons save them, Ash captures the Muk. When Ash first caught Muk, its smell was able to escape the Poké Ball, much to everyone`s displeasure. For this reason, Muk was given to Professor Oak. A running gag in the series involves Muk and his overly affectionate personality. He constantly expressing gratitude towards Professor Oak by hugging him, and in the process smothering him with its gooey body, he also started to do this with Professor Birch.</description>

<description>Shellder is a cheeky bivalve (oyster or clam) Pokémon; it constantly pokes its tongue out at anybody, whether friend or foe. It will also spit on foes. This tends to antagonize enemies into a rage. Its shell is very strong, apparently harder than a diamond, though only made of a single, smooth layer. Shellder becomes vulnerable when the enemy can attack its insides. When not protecting itself in battle, it will attack by squirting water at the foe. As a last resort, it will clamp the foe with its powerful shell. However, this leaves Shellder vulnerable to an attack, hence, it is rarely used. As a total last resort, Shellder may use Selfdestruct or Explosion to knock itself and the enemy out. Shellder travels by rapidly opening and closing its shell, propelling it in the opposite direction of its shell through the water. Shellder are incapable of travel on land, unless in a Poké Ball.
Shellder is integral to the evolution of Slowpoke as is the body part of Slowpoke to which Shellder bites on: its tail. Once Shellder bites the Slowpoke`s tail, the two will evolve into a single Pokémon, Slowbro. If Shellder instead attaches itself to Slowpoke`s head, it will create Slowking, a notably smarter Pokémon than the other two. This evolution can be reversed if Shellder falls off Slowbro`s tail or Slowking`s head. The evolution benefits both Pokémon: Slowpoke can now walk on its hind legs and Shellder can both eat the scraps of the Slowpoke, and finally move on land. The newly attached Shellder looks very different from its previous purple form.</description>

<description>Cloyster are bivalve Pokémon, guarded by an extremely strong, multi-layered shell. This shells cannot be opened even by those with superior strength, and they cannot be damaged even by a bomb. Nobody has seen their dark innards, which are Cloyster`s weak spot as they are very soft and vulnerable. They launch thick, powerful spikes at enemies in battle, as well as to capture prey. These spikes are even stronger than their shell. Cloyster can also crush prey by clamping their thick shell shut onto them. When being attacked, they simply shut their shells to avoid further damage. To travel through water, they swim by swallowing water and jetting it out opposite to the direction they want to move.</description>

<description>Gastly (Spirit in the Beta versions of the English language versions of Pokémon Red and Blue) is made of a very thin, gas-like substance, which grants it certain powers and weaknesses. Some say it is an other-dimensional lifeform, while others believe it is formed from toxic gas. It can sneak into any place if it so wishes thanks to the invasive properties of gas molecules. It can render itself nearly invisible and approach enemies undetected, and can envelop said enemies regardless of their size and induce sleepiness, slow poisoning through the skin, or even suffocation.
On the other hand, Gastly`s negligible weight and gaseous nature make it very easy for it to be blown off or even scattered to nothingness under a strong wind (although it is presumed the molecules can regroup later). A Gastly will not appear in windy weather if it can help it, but when it finds itself threatened by a strong wind, it clusters in groups under the eaves of houses to protect itself.</description>

<description>Haunter (Spectre in the beta versions of Red/Blue) takes the shape of an angular floating face with disembodied hands. It has a sinister look, complete with fangs and claws. However, when approached by people, it has a habit of reverting to a spherical form that obscures its eyes, mouth, and hands. Haunter is considered in the Pokédex to be a `gas type` Pokémon, because of the overall structure of his body. Because of its ability to slip through block walls, Haunter is said to be from another dimension. They seem to eat by first paralyzing their opponent with Lick, then draining a bit of their life force, although it`s possible they may eat other food as well, such things like Pokéblocks. It is also said to eat people`s dreams by going inside them and scaring them to death. It is the lightest of all discovered pokemon.</description>

<description>Gengar is a dual-type Ghost/Poison Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Haunter when traded. It is the final form of Gastly. It can Mega Evolve into Mega Gengar using the Gengarite. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Gengar is a dark purple, bipedal Pokémon with a roundish body. It has red eyes, a wide mouth that is usually curled into a sinister grin, and pointed ears. On its back are numerous spikes and it has smaller spikes on top of its head similar to tufty fur. Its arms and legs are short with three digits on both its hands and feet. It also has a stubby tail.
Gengar has the ability to hide perfectly in the shadow of any object, granting it exceptional stealth. However, Gengar`s body acts as a heat sink. Its presence cools the temperature of the surrounding area by nearly 10°F (5°C), because it absorbs the warmth. The anime has shown that Gengar can fly and possess people and other Pokémon. In the past, Night Shade was its signature move.
Gengar is very mischievous, and at times, malicious. It enjoys playing practical jokes and casting curses, such as pretending to be one`s shadow, then behaving erratically. When the quarry notices, the Gengar takes delight in its victim`s terror. However, Gengar has been known to be loyal to a Trainer who treats it well. Being the result of an evolution via trading, Gengar is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in caves and dark places where shadows form. It is especially fond of urban areas such as cities and back alleys, but only during the night.
As Mega Gengar, a portion of its body sinks into the ground and its arms and tail lengthen. The lower portions turn a more reddish purple, and a third eye appears on its forehead. This new unblinking eye is oval, yellow, and allows it to see into other dimensions. The spikes on Mega Gengar`s back are more numerous and pointed and additional spikes appear on its hands and tail. Its ears are now considerably longer and tilt backward.
Mega Gengar has the ability to access other dimensions and has a vicious nature. Mega Gengar has no itnerests in opponents unless perceived as prey. Its relationships are warped due to Mega Evolution. It now desires to take the life and curse anyone or anything in its path It may even curse its own Trainer. Mega Gengar sinks into an another dimension to wait for a chance to attack.
As Gigantamax Genger, it becomes larger with portions of its body sinking into ground. Only the head, tail, and arms remain. Also it changes to from a dark purple to lighter purple. The eyes change to the color white with yellow sclera. The inside of the mouth changes to resemble a tunnel with a long purple tounge sticking out. Three red clouds surrounds the top of Gengar’s head.
There’s a rumor where Gigantamax Gengar’s mouth does not lead into its body. Due the cursed energy, it’s believed to instead lead into the afterlife. By laying a trap, it hope to steal the lives of those it captures. Should someone stand near its mouth, they can hear the voices of their loved ones calling out to them.
Gigantamax Gengar is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Terror.</description>

<description>Onix is a subterranean creature that bores its way through the ground at a rate of 50 mph (80 km/h) in search of food. The tunnels it leaves behind as it burrows through the earth are used as pre-dug homes by other subterranean Pokémon such as Diglett and Geodude. Within Onyx`s member is a structure nigh identical to a magnet, which allows it to determine its heading, its depth underground, and other such information useful for a subterranean Pokémon to know. It acts quite like a compass. As Onix ages, it burrows deeper underground, and its rocky member becomes progressively harder, rounder, and smoother. Around the age of 100, the pressures exerted on its stone member become so high that it is compressed into a much harder, diamond-like composition, although it is closer to metal in nature.
In the anime, an Onix is owned by Brock as part of the many Pokemon owned by the training gym that Brock`s family runs. Brock had initially received the Onix from his father, who is a specialist in rock-type Pokemon. When Brock feels the need to travel with Ash Ketchum yet again, he entrusts the care of the Onix to one of his many younger brothers. This takes place in Pokémon Chronicles. It eventually evolves into a Steelix.</description>

<description>Krabby is a crab with large pincers. Krabby is an omnivore and a scavenger; it rarely hunts for itself. It can also act as a filter feeder by digesting the bacteria in sand, but this is rare. It is territorial, and in beaches where there is little food, fights between Krabby are common. Krabby also uses camouflage; it can form mucus sacs about itself if threatened, making it seem larger or making it harder to spot against sea sand. It is usually very small, but it makes up by its aggressiveness.
Krabby first appeared at a beach in episode 13, Mystery At The Lighthouse, when Ash Ketchum wanted to prove that he could catch a Pokémon alone. After the capture (which involved Krabby attacking Ash`s finger), it was automatically transferred to Professor Oak`s lab, because Ash already had six Pokémon with him. To Ash`s great surprise, Gary had also caught another Krabby, which was much larger than his. Ash used Krabby in his first battle at the Indigo Tournament. Krabby won against an Exeggutor and evolved into Kingler, despite the fact that Krabby had never battled before.</description>

<description>Voltorb are aggressive red and white ball shaped Pokémon that looks strikingly similar to a Poké Ball. Coincidently it was discovered shortly after Poké Balls were invented, some believe there is a connection. Though roughly ten times larger, many trainers get a surprise when they pick one up thinking it is a Poké Ball. The strength of their explosions is dependent on how much electricity they store in their bodies. When jarred or angered, a Voltorb can and will explode, causing massive damage to their aggressor and themselves (as seen in the video games when they use the moves `Self-Destruct` or `Explosion`, both of which causes fainting to the user). It is so unstable that even the slightest bump in the road will make it explode spontaneously. Voltorb do not have a mouth, but do have two eyes that are normally slanted into an aggressive or angry stare.</description>

<description>Exeggcute is a single Pokémon with six separate seed bodies (often mistaken for eggs, according to the Pokemon episode, "March of the Exeggutor Squad"). Exeggcute`s name is a play on the phrase "eggs are cute." It is also a play on the word execute. Tamatama could be taken to mean 偶々, unexpectedly, although it is more likely to be derived from 玉 tama, sphere, doubled. It is worth noting that the Japanese word for egg is 卵 tamago. They use telepathic signals only they can receive to remain in their balanced formation; even if one is separated, it will quickly rejoin its swarm. Each member of the swarm have a different appearance in number of cracks, deformations, personalities and expression. Some Exeggcute can have such severe cracking and breakage that a Yolk can be seen inside. The middle body often has the fewest or no cracks at all, and is assumed to be the boss of the group.</description>

<description>Exeggutor`s name is believed to be derived from the name of its previous evolutionary stage (Exeggcute), whose name is derived from egg and the word execute so Exeggutor`s name is a combination of egg and executor. The Japanese name is derived from the words ココナッツ kokonattsu (coconuts) and 椰子 yashi (palm tree). A large Coconut Tree like Pokémon with three independent thinking heads. The heads are considered fruit or nuts and each has a different expression on its face similar to Exeggcute. When an Exeggcute evolves into Exeggutor, any and all cracks and breaks are mended as they turn yellow and combine to form the new Exeggutor. Living in a good environment will allow it to grow lots of heads, and it is said that they occasionally fall off to form new Exeggcute.</description>

<description>Cubone`s name is a combination of the words cub and bone, in reference to its young age and relation to bones, both as weapons and armor. The "Cu-" may also be derived from cute, as Cubone is rather referred to as cute and lonely, or the derogatory term "cue ball", referring to a bald person, which is a reference to the skull it wears. Its Japanese name is most likely a pun on 空 kara (emptiness), 殻 kara (shell), and/or からから karakara (dried-up). In the Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow a Cubone is adopted by Mr. Fuji after its mother is killed by Team Rocket. Cubone is also a playable character in Pokémon Red Rescue Team and Pokémon Blue Rescue Team. The skull a Cubone wears on its head is said to be the skull of its mother, who dies whenever a Cubone is born. Because it never removes its skull helmet, no one has ever seen a Cubone`s actual face. Its cries for its mother are often heard echoing inside the skull.</description>

This Pokémon evolves from Cubone and, unlike Cubone, hides its feelings of despair for its loss mother with anger. In Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow a Marowak`s ghost haunts the Pokémon Tower in Lavender Town. Team Rocket is indicated by Cubone`s caretaker to have been the cause of the death. Unlike the skull helmet on a Cubone, a Marowak`s skull helmet is tightly fitted over its face.</description>

The Japanese name uses the English loanword "gas" (which is used by Japanese to refer to both gasoline and the state of matter), with the prefix "do" meaning "bad" or "poisonous". Koffing are often found near abandoned buildings (burned out preferred), Caves and Volcanic rich environments. Koffing spew gases from their crater like ridges that cover their body. Koffing have a Cyclops like Skull and Cross Bones symbol on their chest and stomach. The Skull has three teeth detailed on it. Koffing have two small fangs protruding from the top of its mouth. Koffing often have a jolly or spaced out expression on their face while looking up. James from Team Rocket used a Koffing until it evolved into a Weezing. In Pokémon Snap, Koffings can be seen following Jigglypuffs around causing Jigglypuff discomfort. Koffing is also one of the Pokémon signs as well as a star constellation in the game.</description>

<description>Seaking is a goldfish Pokemon. The "sea" in Seaking`s name refers to the fact that it is a water-inhabiting Pokemon. "King" is probably a reference to its unevolved form`s name, Goldeen (a portmanteau of "gold" and "queen"). Hence, its name means "king of the sea." Its Japanese name refers to Azumanishiki (東錦) for one kind of "goldfish" and Ou (王) for "king". Seaking was originally called Neptune in the beta. Seaking is a goldfish Pokemon with a sharp horn, much like a narwhal. It uses the horn for boring holes in a rock for its nest. In spawning season, they can be seen swimming up rivers and streams.</description>

<description>Starmie is an aquatic starfish Pokémon that evolves from Staryu through use of a Water Stone. It moves through the water by spinning its star-shaped body in a manner like that of a propeller. It consists of two five-point, purple star-shaped structures superimposed on top of each other. At its center is a large gem, surrounded by a golden crest like structure. Starmie`s center section - the gem - is known as its "core". This gem is considered very valuable among collectors. The gem`s hue can change to any color in the visual spectrum, earning Starmie the nickname "the gem of the sea". When Starmie is weak, the core grows dim and starts flickering whilst producing distinctive warning sounds.
In the Pokémon world, the aforementioned peculiar properties of Starmie`s anatomy leads some people to theorize that Starmie`s origins are not of this planet, and that its luminescent core is used to send electromagnetic signals into outer space. It may have some connection with Deoxys having a similar core and the ability to regenerate. In ancient times, Starmie was attributed an equally mystical origin: that it was created from the reflection of the stars upon the waves at night.
In the anime, Starmie is one of the Pokémon used in Misty`s team during the most of the Kanto arc, along with its pre-evolved form, Staryu. Misty also often used Starmie outside of battle for transportation through water or for fire-fighting purposes. Misty eventually left Starmie in the care of her sisters at the Cerulean City Gym, and later reobtained it upon her return.</description>

<description>Scyther is a mantis Pokémon. Its English name was originally going to be Stryke, as revealed in the 1999 Nintendo Official Magazine Pokémon Special #2. Scyther`s most impressive feature is its scythe-like arms that can easily cut through metal. Scyther is also noted for its agility. While hunting in the wild or in a battle between trainers, it relies on its speed to strike quickly and to avoid being struck in return by its foe. Its high-supernatural speed can make it seem to be in more than one place at once, or to seem invisible as it moves in, strikes, and leaves the opponent before he can feel the blow. Scyther`s wings are capable of flight, but this is rare; it is not a fast or an agile flier, and it is a better hunter on its own feet.
In the anime, Tracey Sketchit catches a Scyther in the Orange Islands. It is aged and was recently removed from its clan by a younger, stronger Scyther. The bug Pokémon reconcile their differences through the interference of Team Rocket, and Tracey`s Scyther is allowed to leave with him with its conflicts fully resolved. Tracey`s Scyther is incredibly strong-willed, preferring to keep watch over the travellers while they sleep, as opposed to staying in its Poké Ball.
In the episode "Showdown at Dark City", two gangs were fighting in a dusty town. The leader of one team had an Electabuzz while the other had a Scyther. When Ash poured ketchup barrels on both Pokémon, they locked into each other in a death grip, meaning that Scyther and Electabuzz are possibly provoked by the color red.</description>

<description>Since Electabuzz is electric, he feeds on electrical currents. Its methods of securing its food vary: during thunderstorms, an Electabuzz climbs to the highest place possible, in hopes that it will be struck by lightning. As a result, many towns in the Pokémon world employ an Electabuzz in lieu of a lightning rod. Electabuzz also lurk around power plants, feeding off the electricity generated there. This behavior is dangerous to the public, as occasionally blackouts are caused by an Electabuzz overindulging itself at a power plant, or worse, walking down to a city and drawing electricity from there.
Due to its unique diet, Electabuzz`s body is constantly discharging stored electricity, to the point that it glows whitish blue in darkness and static electricity effects manifest. An Electabuzz can control the electric current coursing in its body to communicate with other Electric-type Pokémon, especially with another Electabuzz. It originally is lone in its evolutionary line, but it gains a previous form, Elekid, in Pokémon Gold and Silver, and an evolution, Electivire, in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.
Like Scyther, as seen in the anime, Electabuzz is most likely provoked by the color red.</description>

<description>Magmar is born in the proximity of an active volcano, and if possible it spends its entire life there, or at least in a place hot enough to sustain its body temperature of 3,300 degrees Fahrenheit. If a Magmar finds itself in a cold place, it will try to make it more habitable by blowing scorching flames around. It has the ability to expel orange-colored fire from every part of its body, including its mouth. This serves both offensive and defensive purposes: a Magmar cloaked in flames resembles a big ball of fire. Together with its matching body coloration, Magmar can quite easily hide itself among flames, escaping detection. If Magmar is actually wounded, it can heal itself by dipping its wound(s) in lava. When it emerges, damp soil clings onto its body. In Gold and Silver, Magmar gets a pre-evolution, Magby, and in Diamond and Pearl, an evolution, Magmortar.
Magmar has appeared in the anime owned by various people but the ones of note are the Gym Leader Blaine, Ash`s now ex-rival, Gary Oak, and his new rival, Paul. Paul had been looking for a new fire Pokémon since the release of Chimchar in "Glory Blaze" and captured Magmar sometime between capturing Gliscor in ""Gliscor and Gligar: Getting Through the Wind Maze" and his Gym Battle, with Maylene which was shown as a flashback in "Lucario and the Aura Sphere of Rage."</description>

<description>Pinsir is a bug-type stag beetle Pokémon covered with a thick exoskeleton. Its large pincers are adorned with sharp spikes which serve to damage foes caught in the pincers and to prevent escape. If it fails to crush its foe, it will throw the foe powerfully against the ground or into another object with its pincers. Pinsir requires warm habitats to survive. It becomes immobilized in cold climates. It burrows itself into dirt using its pincers and sleeps in the burrow through the night.</description>

<description>Tauros is a bull known for its violent urges and rowdy, aggressive disposition in general, as supplied by a tremendous amount of natural stamina. Any given Tauros finds it impossible to keep up its spirits in life without near-constant rampaging. It always tries to find opponent Pokémon to battle outright to serve this purpose, but if it is alone, it will instead concentrate on charging at and knocking down thick trees to calm itself. By locking horns with other Tauros, it fights to assert dominance in a herd. The protector of the herd is usually noted by battle torn horns. As Tauros is based on a bull, it is a male-only Pokémon; its female equivalent is the more cowlike Miltank.
Tauros has a special habit that specifically affects its ability to battle, both in the wild and in trainer-directed Pokémon battles: It whips itself with its three long snapping tails. When it targets an enemy, it heightens its will to battle by whipping its own backside with its tails before charging at full speed.
In the anime, Ash Ketchum captures a herd of thirty Tauros in the Safari Zone (though the episode which features this was banned in America due to its flagrant gun use and politically incorrect humor). They usually remain in Professor Oak`s fields, Ash occasionally picks one up for various tournaments or important battles.</description>

<description>Magikarp is a commonly found Pokémon that can survive in rivers, lakes,and oceans. Despite its adaptability, the Pokédex states that the Magikarp species has grown weaker over time, and it is one of the least viable for battling in the series. It eventually evolves into another, far more powerful Pokémon, Gyarados.
Magikarp is commonly thought of as the weakest Pokémon. They are only able to learn three moves: Splash (does absolutely nothing), Tackle (a weak attack), and Flail (which does more damage as Magikarp is more damaged.)
In the anime, Magikarp has appeared several times, most notably as the subject of a running gag in which a salesman attempts to trick Team Rocket into buying Magikarp in various guises. (This man also appears in Pokémon Red, Blue, Yellow, FireRed, and LeafGreen.) Team Rocket later adopted a Magikarp-shaped submarine.
Magikarp also appear many times in the video games. They can be found in almost any pond, river, lake, or sea. Many trainers have them, along with other weak Water Pokémon like Goldeen or Horsea. In Pokémon Pearl, one trainer named "Ander," found outside Lake Valor, possesses a Magikarp whose move "Quake" replaces the normal Magikarp`s equally useless "Splash".</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Gyarados is the evolved form of Magikarp. It is a dramatically large change from Magikarp, going from a small fish to a long draconic, serpentine body. Gyarados tend to be very aggressive, and are powerful enough to destroy entire cities. They have a reputation for appearing where there is conflict, and shrivelling everything up with the Hyper Beam attack. Rampages like this have been known to last upwards of an entire month, and will not end until everything around them has been destroyed. Because they have been known to sink ships as well through the seastorms their rage causes, they are considered legendary among sailors, especially the red/ golden variety. Its big change in behavior is said to be attributed to a structural change occurring in its brain while evolving from Magikarp.
In the beta version of Pokémon Red and Green, Gyarados had the name of Skullkraken.
Shiny Gyarados is a particularly rare variety of Gyarados. While Gyarados are normally blue in color, there are some rare red/ gold scaled Gyarados. Though no more powerful than their more common blue counterparts, red Gyarados are valued for their rarity and individuality. This is caused in Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal and the anime by a radio frequency transmitted by Team Rocket to force the Magikarp to evolve. The red coloration comes from the Magikarp evolving prematurely, and not undergoing the conversion from red to blue scale pigment. Thus, they retain the same color they had as a Magikarp. Red Gyarados are more commonly called Shiny Gyarados, or even Golden Gyarados due to the contrasting coloration.
In Generation II Pokémon games, a red Gyarados at the Lake of Rage is a main part of the plot. After its defeat or capture, a Red Scale is obtained, which can be given to Mr. Pokémon, or Marcus Spanier, in exchange for an Exp. Share. The red Gyarados is the only Pokémon in the Generation II games that will be shiny without fail.
In the anime, one is owned by Misty. At first, she fearfully dislikes Gyarados due to a traumatic experience, but manages to get over the fear, take over the Cerulean City Gym, and add one to her team. The red Gyarados in the anime is caught by Lance, the dragon trainer, to rescue it from Team Rocket. Team Rocket also uses a Gyarados-shaped submarine in early episodes, but trades it for a Magikarp-shaped submarine in later episodes.
Gyarados was noticeably larger in the Indigo Series, but has since become a lot smaller. Gyarados` most powerful attack is said to be Dragon Rage (however, this is not true in the games, given that Dragon Rage only ever does 40 damage), where many other Gyarados appear around the main Gyarados, then they start spinning around at such a speed they became one huge tornado, as seen in Episode #18: Island of The Giant Pokémon.</description>

<description>Lapras is a dual-type Water/Ice Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, it has a Gigantamax form.
Lapras is a large sea Pokémon that resembles a plesiosaur. It has a blue hide with darker blue spots and a cream-colored underside. It has large brown eyes, a short horn on its forehead, and tightly curled ears. It has a long neck and four flippers. The foremost flippers are larger than the hind. On its back is a heavy, gray shell covered in blunt knobs.
Lapras is a gentle, helpful Pokémon that enjoys ferrying people across bodies of water. In the past, its docility made it an easy target for hunters, and it was driven to near-extinction. Recent protection efforts have seen Lapras become overabundant instead, which is now affecting the fish Pokémon numbers in some areas. An intelligent Pokémon, it is able to understand human speech. Lapras have been known to travel in large pods across the seas, spanning both polar and tropical areas. To keep in touch with other of its kind, it sings enchanting melodies. In the anime it was shown that Lapras is able to develop psychic abilities such as telepathy.
As Gigantamax Lapras, it becomes larger in size and more armored. Its shell resembles a cruise ship with four gray and red stripes surrounding it, and it has four spikes on top of its shell with one steel spike resembling a funnel, which has three red clouds surrounding it. The sclera in Lapras` eyes change colors to white, yellow, and blue. A light blue ring of fine thin lines resembling a musical sheet created from ice particles circles around its shell.
5,000 people can ride on the shell of Gigantamax Lapras for a very comfortable ride without any issues. Lapras can use it giant ring to break any icebergs that may prevent it from swimming.
Gigantamax Lapras is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Resonance.</description>

<description>Ditto has the form of an amorphous blob with a simplistic face. Ditto is purple and is able to rearrange its cellular structure into anything at will, but it usually changes into another Pokémon nearby. It takes on the exact form of the Pokémon and can use all of its abilities. The only things that can make it change back are being defeated and the Ditto laughing. During the night, it transforms into a rock to avoid being attacked. If it tries to transform from memory, or if it is inexperienced, it will likely mess up on certain details such as leaving its own face or staying its own size. The only other Pokémon capable of transforming is the legendary Pokémon Mew.
In the games, with the exception of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, it takes on the type and attacks of its opponent, but each attack has 5 PP. However in a battle between two dittos when it transforms its pp is reset to 5. Being its only move this forms an continual loop. It can also breed with any Pokémon that is capable of breeding, including genderless Pokémon such as Staryu or Porygon. In the anime, two Ditto are owned by Duplica, a girl who can easily imitate people. The first Ditto is used to help her run a theater. At first it cannot correctly transform its face, but with the help of Team Rocket, it overcomes that barrier. The second Ditto, "Mini-Dit", cannot change its size at all.
In Mystery Dungeon Red and Blue Rescue Team, when Ditto transforms it cannot copy any of the transformed Pokémon moves. Therefore it has only 2 attack choices -- use the attack unique to Mystery Dungeon, or use Struggle.</description>

<description>Eevee is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves into one of eight different Pokémon through various methods. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Eevee is the game mascot and starter Pokémon in Pokémon: Let`s Go, Eevee!, as well as for the main characters of Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness and Pokémon Conquest. It is also the rival`s starter Pokémon in Pokémon Yellow, although Professor Oak originally intended to give it to the player.
Eevee is a mammalian, quadruped Pokémon with primarily brown fur. The tip of its bushy tail and its large furry collar are cream-colored. It has short, slender legs with three small toes and a pink paw pad on each foot. Eevee has brown eyes, long pointed ears with dark brown interiors, and a small black nose. Eevee is rarely found in the wild and is mostly only found in cities and towns. However, Eevee is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure that is easily influenced by its environment. This allows it to adapt to a variety of habitats by evolving. Eevee is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Extreme Evoboost.
In Pokémon: Let`s Go, Eevee!, the player starts with a special Eevee known as a Partner Eevee. The Partner Eevee has purple eyes and a lighter shade of fur. These design elements likely taken from the anime, which implemented similar traits starting in the Advanced Generation series. The marking on the tip of a female Partner Eevee is heart-shaped. Before Pokémon Sword and Shield, this trait was unique and wasn`t found on other female Eevee. Partner Eevee has higher base stats and access to moves that normal Eevee do not. Partner Eevee is the only Pokémon capable of performing Bouncy Bubble, Buzzy Buzz, Sizzly Slide, Glitzy Glow, Baddy Bad, Sappy Seed, Freezy Frost, Sparkly Swirl, and the Partner Power, Veevee Volley. In Pokémon Sword and Shield, the unique pattern is present on all female Eevee as a true gender difference.
As Gigantamax Eevee, it has become larger and more fluffy. The fur collar becomes longer with several triangular furs pointing straight up. The right ear has three red clouds surrounding it like a circle. Due to the fur becoming fluffier and luxurious, any enemies caught in it will lose the will to fight due to being enamored by its presence. Due to Gigantamaxing, Eevee becomes even more playful and rambunctious, desiring to play with its opponent and often unintentionally crushing them with its size.
Gigantamax Eevee is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Cuddle.</description>

Its ears are as long as the Jolteon`s. It stores thermal energy from the sun, causing its body temperature to skyrocket to more than a range of 1600 degrees Celsius, releasing its flames from an internal sack. Its ability is `Flash Fire` which negates fire-type moves against it and increases its attack by 1.5 times damage if hit by a damaging fire attack.</description>

<description>Snorlax is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Munchlax when leveled up with high friendship. It also has a Gigantamax form.
In the Generation I and II games and their remakes, wild Snorlax can be found sleeping in inconvenient locations throughout Kanto. In order to catch one, a Trainer must first awaken it with music from either a Poké Flute or Pokégear set to the Poké Flute channel. A sleeping Snorlax makes a return in Pokémon X and Y, in which it is blocking the player`s way on Route 7.
Snorlax is a huge, bipedal, dark blue-green Pokémon with a cream-colored face, belly, and feet. Its body is composed of mostly its belly, as its limbs are comparatively small. Its head is large with small, pointed ears and two pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw. It has round feet, which both have three claws and a circular brown paw pad, and short arms with five claws on each hand. Snorlax`s bulk makes it the heaviest Normal type.
Snorlax is often found in mountains and forests. It wakes up only to eat, requiring 900 lbs. (400 kg) of food per day before returning to its slumber. It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it to eat even moldy food without feeling any ill effects. It can even handle thorny plants or Muk`s poison. It can also eat while it is resting. Snorlax is docile enough to let children and small Pokémon bounce on its large stomach.
Snorlax can show awesome power when prompted. As Gigantamax Snorlax, seeds and small rocks that were tangled in its belly fur goes through immense growth and a tree spouts upon its belly. The tree has three red clouds surrounding it like a circle. It almost never moves; even when in battle it only slightly lifts its body and attacks by flailing with its arms and legs. However, its attacks are very powerful — Gigantamax Snorlax is considered to be the strongest Dynamax Pokémon to have been discovered.
It is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Pulverizing Pancake and G-Max Move G-Max Replenish.</description>

<description>Dratini is a serpent-like dragon Pokémon with a white circle shape on its forehead. It has two developing wings at the sides of its head, which grow to be enormous as it evolves. Dratini are born small, and as they shed their skin, they grow larger. They have a massive amount of energy rapidly increasing inside of their bodies, hence, they have great strength which grows exponentially as they evolve. They were thought to be purely mythical creatures, but they were discovered to be real by a fisherman. They live in colonies in the ocean in limited numbers and fetch a high price as Pokémon to be used for battling. They can only be obtained by the most determined and skilled trainers, as demonstrated on various episodes of the original Pokémon series.
The episode in which Dratini first appeared ("The Legend of Dratini") has never been seen on American television, due to use of guns and humor considered "politically incorrect" to American audiences (Meowth dressed as Adolf Hitler, Jessie seducing a guard by dressing up as a schoolgirl).</description>

<description>Dragonair is the evolved form of Dratini. They look like desert serpents with a long, noticeable, light-blue and white body. They have a small horn on the forehead and two wing-shaped protuberances on the sides of the head which are often said to be ears, but are in fact wings, as evidenced in the short film preceding Pokémon: The Movie 2000. They have a blue orb placed at the neck and another two near the tip of the tail. Dragonair can discharge energy through the orbs to envelop itself in a gentle aura. This aura, which makes its body shine slightly and gives it a mystical appearance, is said to enable the Dragonair to control the weather in the immediate area and change it in a matter of minutes.
Dragonair live in large bodies of water such as the lakes or the sea. They store an enormous amount of energy inside their bodies, and seems to manifest itself in two distinct fashions. Even though they lack large wings, Dragonair have been seen flying with the wings on the side of the head greatly enlarged.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Mew is a Psychic-type legendary Pokémon. It was first introduced as a secret Pokémon in the first generation. Nintendo`s specialists in Pokémon have spoken, in Nintendo`s Pokémon-related speech in 2007, that Mewtwo is more powerful than Mew, therefore being a clone (better from the original: Pokémon Red and Blue and Yellow). Mew appears as a pink feline-esque Pokémon with large feet, big blue eyes, and a very long tail. Its skin is covered with a layer of fine pink hair. By nature, Mew is known to be a playful and kind Pokémon. Its DNA is said to possess the genetic composition of all existing Pokémon species, thus allowing it to use all known Pokémon techniques. In the anime, it is also capable of further teleportation, summoning giant pink bubbles of psychic energy (which serve various purposes such as closing itself in for protection, act as a cushion, or simply for Mew`s amusement of bouncing on), and rendering itself invisible.
In the first generation video games, Mew is mentioned in journal entries found in the Pokémon Mansion on Cinnabar Island stating that it was discovered deep in the jungles of Guyana, South America on July 5 (the year was not specified) and named on July 10, and that it "gave birth" to Mewtwo on Feb. 6. Mew was available at Kiosks during special events held by Nintendo after the release of Red, Blue, and Yellow. However, a glitch exists in these Generation I games that allows the player to capture a level 7 Mew.
Mew plays a role in some of the Pokémon anime films. In Pokémon: The First Movie, Mewtwo was created from a fossilized Mew hair found in the Amazon. A single Mew travels to where Mewtwo is holding its tournament in order to convince it to stop. It also made a short appearance in Mewtwo Returns (a special episode involving the whole of Team Rocket (including Giovanni) and Mewtwo, as well as various other characters.) In Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew, the backdrop revolves around Mew`s mysterious history and how this extremely rare Pokémon came to be so powerful. Also, at the beginning of the movie, a Pokémon "family tree" is shown. The first Pokémon on it is Mew, and the last is Ho-oh. Since Mew contains the genetic composition that is found in every species of Pokémon, Mew has the ability to transform into any Pokémon like Ditto. However, in the anime, Mew does not need to see the Pokémon in order to transform into it.</description>

<description>Cyndaquil is the Fire-type Starter Pokémon in Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal. In Pokémon Emerald you may get Cyndaquil after completing the Hoenn Dex. Cyndaquil are covered with a flame-resistant, dull-yellow fur with a rich streak of blue running from the tip of its snout over its head and spreading out to cover the majority of its back. There are also four spots of red fur on the back. When Cyndaquil is frightened or angry, it can focus its internal energy to produce blazing "spines" of flame from the spots. While it is a quadruped, Cyndaquil is more than capable of maneuvering on two legs. They are based on an echidna.
Cyndaquil are generally timid and not naturally aggressive, and are often seen curled into a ball for protection. This action leaves its back and special flame-emitting vent fur exposed. When predators and enemies stalk too close, Cyndaquil unleashes a furious flame from the vents as a deterrent. If provoked further, Cyndaquil will intensify its flames, creating a smokescreen that will buy it some time to escape.
Cyndaquil has made numerous appearances in the Pokémon anime, mostly under the control of Ash. His Cyndaquil often seemed to be very shy and relaxed, often sleeping. At first, it needed time to warm up and use flamethrower, but with some training from Ash, it is now able to use its flamethrower whenever it wants. It also possesses prodigious dodging capabilities, able to wear opponents down by simply evading long series of attacks over an extended period of time. Cyndaquil is currently at Professor Oak`s lab since Ash decided to make a fresh start when going to Hoenn, and therefore, left all of its Pokémon, except Pikachu, with Professor Oak.</description>

Their tan fur is slightly darker than Cyndaquil`s, while the blue streak has been lowered to cover their eyes. As per the family line, Quilava sport short, coarse fireproof fur and have special vents on their heads and lower backs. Though they do not have a tail, the lower vents are positioned as to give the illusion of one.
Quilava are noted in the Pokédex to turn their backs toward their opponents in battle as a sign that they are about to use their flame-based abilities in battle, or to intimidate foes by demonstrating their power. Quilava are noted for their speed, and can nimbly evade attacks while scorching their enemies. They can also create gusts of superheated air, albeit to the same effect.</description>

When Ledyba become part of a swarm, they become much more active and can cluster next to each other for warmth in cold weather. A Ledyba communicates with others through an aromatic fluid excreted from the points where its legs meet its thorax. By subtly changing the fluid`s scent, the Ledyba can convey a number of different feelings. The fluid can also help to determine a Ledyba`s location as well as its current feelings.

Male Ledian are shown having longer antennae than females.
Ledian is a nocturnal insect, active mainly during the night and sleeping in curled-up leaves during the day. Countless Ledian live in outdoor areas located a good distance away from the polluted atmospheres of cities, for the star-lit skies are always clearer in these clean lands than in the light pollution of urban areas. Ledian have an affinity to stars for good reason; They take their energy from the light of the stars in order to live healthily. When many stars are visible, the Ledian will sprinkle a mysterious, glowing powder whilst fluttering about.</description>

<description>Spinarak is a six legged spider-like Pokémon with a marking on its back that is similar to a face. It spins a web of fine silk and then waits patiently and with complete motionlessness until prey, such as a bug Pokémon, becomes ensnared in the sticky web. It then waits until nightfall, at which point Spinarak prepares and then devours the prey. The web can be called Spinarak`s "second nervous system" because the Pokémon is able to determine the type of prey that has become trapped simply through the vibrations that are created.
In the anime, there is a small town whose police force uses Spinarak to fight crime, honoring a Spinarak that had caught a criminal called the black arachnid in the past. This was shown in the episode Spinarak attack.</description>

Its habitat is the dark depths of the ocean floor. In the absence of any other light, Chinchou sees its surroundings and communicates by shooting positive and negative charged electricity particles between the tips of its antennae, creating an electric current and thus light. This can be said to be a form of bioluminescence. The charges Chinchou shoots between its antennae can also be used offensively, to stun its opponents with a flash of light or shock them with electricity.</description>

Their cheeks are pink, and they have small, plump bodies with short, jagged tails, and large ears. They are not skilled at storing electricity, so when amused or startled, they often discharge jolts of electricity strong enough to affect adult humans. This lack of control becomes more stable as they grow older. The electricity that they do manage to keep stored is limited by their small electrical pouches in their cheeks. When the air is dry or on stormy days, they charge much more easily, leaving the sound of crackling static electricity emanating from them. They play with each other by touching tails to set off sparks, which also acts as a test of courage. They run the risk of shorting each other out, and scaring themselves into a crying fit with the flash of sparks that emanates from them. In the anime, it is said that a Pichu cannot use electric attacks without hurting itself. This is a feature not prominently featured in the games.
Pichu first appeared in Pokémon Gold and Silver, and is one of many pre-evolutions introduced into the series. At one point, a Nintendo GameCube game called Pichu Bros: Party Panic was in development but never released, featuring Pichu as the main character. Instead, the game was integrated into Pokémon Channel as an important part of the story-line.</description>

<description>Cleffa is the pre-evolution of Clefairy, a small, bipedal creature, shaped like a five-pointed star. It has short pink fur, with a large brown patch on each of its two pointed ears. Between these ears is a large swirl of pink fur. It has two small eyes, no visible nose, and a small mouth. It also has a patch of darker pink fur under each eye. Cleffa first appears in Pokémon Gold and Silver, as one of the several pre-evolutions introduced into the series.
Cleffa love to stick their tongues out and are often seen hanging around other baby Pokémon such as Igglybuff. For unknown reasons, possibly due to its unusual star-shaped silhouette, when lots of meteors illuminate the night sky, sightings of Cleffa strangely increase. Some people believe that they came to the Pokémon universe on a meteor. If the impact site of any meteorite is found, this Pokémon is certain to be within the immediate area. On nights with many shooting stars, Cleffa can be seen dancing in a ringlike formation. They dance through the night and stop only at the break of day, when these Pokémon quench their thirst with the morning dew. Like Staryu, it is a Starshape Pokémon- consequently, scientists in the Pokémon universe are trying to find a connection between the two. In the same way its evolved form Clefairy loves the moon, Cleffa are fond of shooting stars.</description>

<description>Bellossom is a diurnal plant Pokémon. It evolves from Gloom if exposed to a Sun Stone. Bellossom`s petals can rotate, and they usually do when it is absorbing sunlight. The color of their leaves vary from a sickly brown and gray to a fluorescent yellow and red, depending on how much sunlight it has absorbed in the past few hours. When its petals are moving, either due to rotating or dancing, they rub together to make relaxing, bell-like sounds. The petals on its head also create a sweet scent.
It is also noted that a Bellossom will be even more beautiful if it was an especially rancid Gloom. The worse it smells as a Gloom, the prettier its petals will be as a Bellossom. Although naturally a peaceful and friendly Pokémon, it can be very territorial and violent fights can break out if there is an intruder or a challenger. Despite this, it is very social in areas outside of its self-determined territory, and the most common time to find a group of Bellossom together is when they all meet in one location to dance. It is said that these dances summon the sun.
Its Japanese name, "Kireihana", translates to "Beautiful" (kirei) and "Flower" (hana).</description>

<description>Sudowoodo is a bending, bipedal creature vaguely in the shape of a tree trunk. It has a double-pronged protuberance on its head, tiny feet, a simple face, and a pair of three-fingered hands where the fingers are green spheres resembling leaves on a tree. Although Sudowoodo pretends to be a tree, its body is made not out of wood, but rock. It uses this as a form of camouflage, hiding among forest areas to avoid being attacked by enemies. Additionally, its signature technique is Mimic, which allows it to copy enemy attacks. It earns its classification as the imitation Pokémon through these practices.
In the winter seasons, when trees are either white with snow or have had their leaves fall off from autumn, Sudowoodo is easy to spot as a fake because its hands remain green, making winter a more dangerous time for Sudowoodo to be in the presence of foes. Also, as a creature whose composition resembles rock, Sudowoodo hates water, so it will disappear and seek shelter when rainfall begins. In the video games, it often blocks areas until sprayed with water, which causes it to battle. In Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, the twig-shaped appendage atop a Sudowoodo`s head is larger on a male than it is on a female. The origin of its name is: Pseudo (False) + Wood.</description>

<description>Aipom resembles a purple squirrel monkey with its face forever frozen in a maniacal grin that can be described as rictus and a blank stare from its round eyes. On its thin tail is a three fingered hand-like appendage that is very dexterous. It provides both propulsion and balance while Aipom leaps from tree to tree. Aipom is not aggressive by nature and will attempt to tire its natural opponents through dexterous dodging of the opponent`s attacks in hope that the enemy will be discouraged and leave. Otherwise, if the enemy is persistent, the Aipom will try to retreat, but if it is unable to, it will attack by diving at its opponent from the trees.
In the anime, an Aipom steals Ash`s hat, and follows his group around until Ash battles and captures it. Ash`s Aipom is quite attached to him, getting incredibly jealous when it sees Pikachu on Ash`s shoulder. Aipom has the distinction of being the only Pokemon aside from Pikachu that Ash brought with him to Sinnoh, although inadvertently. Aipom seems to enjoy contests, and Dawn believes it prefers contests over battles. In "Throwing the Track Switch!", Ash trades Aipom for Dawn`s Buizel because both Pokemon seemed more interested in the other trainer`s training. In "Journey to the Unknown", Dawn`s Aipom evolves into Ambipom.</description>

<description>Quagsire has an appearance and habitat similar to that of a giant salamander. Quagsire live a carefree life in muddy ponds and rivers. It acts oblivious to its environment, accidentally bumping its head on the hulls of boats and bottoms of whatever body of water it swims in as it swims, but seeming not to care. Quagsire always bear an absent-looking facial expression. This is likely due to Quagsire`s easy-going nature. It hunts by staying still in the water with its mouth open, waiting for small prey to swim into its mouth. It doesn`t move, and therefore, doesn`t get hungry. It`s not uncommon that a fishermen`s hook will get caught in the gaping mouth of a feeding Quagsire. Trying to eat what it has caught, the Quagsire would try to swallow, and end up pulling the fishermen off his boat and into the water. Male Quagsire have larger fins on their backs. They wait at the bottom of lakes waiting for prey to wander into its mouth. It also loves eating cherries.</description>

<description>Espeon is an evolved cat-like form of Eevee that became available with the Japanese release of Pokémon Gold and Silver. The appearance of Espeon is said to resemble the Japanese mythological creature known as Nekomata which also displays the feline body with forked tail tip and solid colored eyes. An Espeon`s fur is used to sense air currents, allowing it to predict the weather, as well as the actions of its opponent in battle. Its forked tail quivers when this occurs. A red jewel rests on its head, and glows whenever Espeon uses its psychic abilities. Espeon are described as being very loyal to their trainers once they consider them worthy. They are also said to develop precognitive abilities in order to protect their trainers, Espeon become enabled to see into the future to identify potential threats. Eevee evolves into Espeon by having a high happiness level and leveling up during the day. A Sun Shard item can also be used in Pokémon XD, a Sun Ribbon in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue, Red, Explorers of Time, and Explorers of Darkness. Espeon`s name is derived from "ESP" and the suffix "-eon", as with every evolution of Eevee.</description>

<description>Murkrow is a small black crow with red eyes. The top of its head is styled as a witch`s hat and its tail bristles out like a broomstick. Murkrow is rather unpopular in the Pokémon world. Its dismal appearance and nocturnal nature have long caused it to be considered an omen of ill fortune to all who see it. If a Murkrow finds itself wounded, it fights back by leading its pursuer to dark mountain trails in an attempt to get him hopelessly lost in the darkness.
Murkrow is also attracted to bright, shiny objects, which it collects to stash in its nest. This, of course, leads to many arguments between Murkrow and Meowth, who both share a common love of stashing things - and taking from each other! It does not hesitate to steal such objects if necessary and has even been known to attempt to snatch rings off their owner`s fingers (and complete strangers too, for that matter). With the addition of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, it is revealed that some Murkrow are servants to its evolved form, Honchkrow, who spends all of its time preening and ordering the Murkrow around. Also with Diamond and Pearl`s release, Murkrow, like many other Pokémon, have gender differences. In this case, Males have a taller "hat" - technically, the crest that resembles a three-pointed witch hat - than females would. Murkrow can only be found wild in the Pokémon Diamond Version in Eterna Forest, while Misdreavus can only be found in Pokémon Pearl at the same location.</description>

<description>Misdreavus is a moderately-sized, corporeal apparition that somewhat resembles the disembodied head of a human female. It lacks a nose, has thick, flowing "hair", and large, yellow eyes with red irises. It appears to wear a necklace of red pearls. Misdreavus lives deep in dark caves. It projects frightening screeching and wailing noises, as well as creepy, sobbing cries, at enemy Pokemon it encounters in the caves, so as to build up a level of fright strong enough so that the Pokemon will flee. Misdreavus` pearl necklace apparently serves as its means for feeding by absorbing the fearful feelings of targets for nutrition.
In the event that a human, trepid or otherwise, enters a cave area inhabited by a Misdreavus, the Pokemon will attempt to drive him or her out by biting and pulling at the intruding human`s hair, which is used for defense.</description>

<description>Qwilfish is a porcupinefish-like fish that has a round body with many toxin-containing spikes and a teardrop-shaped tail. The spikes give it trouble swimming, but it also has defensive measures against predators. Qwilfish can swallow large quantities of water in very short notice, causing itself to inflate to a much larger size, which it uses to intimidate larger opponents. If the opponent isn`t scared, Qwilfish uses the pressure of the water it swallowed to shoot out its toxic spikes at, thus weakening, the opponent.</description>

<description>Slugma is a diurnal slug-like Pokémon made of lava. It usually lives in areas of great heat, because it requires heat to live. It can only be motionless for an amount of time if it stays near heated areas. If it strays from a heated area, it must remain in constant motion, or its skin will harden. If it stops moving in this case, it will die slowly from starvation. Despite this, Slugma has the ability to harden at will for protection.</description>

<description>Magcargo is a snail composed of magma with a shell on its back. The shell is actually a thin outgrowth of its skin that hardened due to cooling of the air, in spite of the fact that it lives in the heat of volcanic craters. The shell is brittle and fragile enough that touching it will cause it to break and crumble, though Magcargo "grows" back its shell passively in a short amount of time. Magcargo has a body temperature of approximately 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Since Magcargo is composed of molten lava, when traveling at its slow pace it leaves parts of its continually hardening body on the ground behind it, thus decreasing its physical size. To lose too much of its mass is potentially deadly, so Magcargo routinely restores its size and vitality by dipping its body into volcanic pools of magma.</description>

<description>Corsola is a dual-type Water/Rock Pokémon introduced in Generation II.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
In Galar, Corsola has a Ghost-type regional form. It evolves into Cursola starting at level 38.
Corsola is a small, pink, roundish Pokémon with branch-like growths on its back, which are similar to coral. There is a smaller, blunt horn on its forehead, and it has black, oval eyes. It has a white underside, which speckles towards the sides. Its four legs and two arms are blunt and stubby.
Found in the warm shallow waters of southern seas, Corsola requires clean water to live. If its habitat is dirty, the growths on its back become discolored and degenerate. However, when it is healthy, its growths regularly shed and grow back. It is able to regrow them over the course of a single night. It forms large social groups. Occasionally, these groups get so large that people may live atop them, as is the case in Pacifidlog Town. Corsola`s horn is a prized material, commonly used for jewelry and carving as seen in the anime. Smaller Pokémon like Seadra and Luvdisc are sometimes sheltered by Corsola`s branches, and even offer it protection from foes.
Galarian Corsola were wiped out by sudden changes in ocean temperature caused by a meteor impact, turning them into Ghost-types. Its body is a bleached white with half-closed pink eyes and a perpetual frown, and its arms and branches have a distinctly semitransparent appearance to them; the branches can be used to take root inside and drain the life force of others.
The branches cannot cause injures or pain, but they immobilize the victim until Galarian Corsola lets them go. They are commonly found in the remains of prehistoric seas, and while they can be mistaken for ordinary rocks, they will curse anybody who kicks them by accident.
In the Alola region, Mareanie and Toxapex are natural predators of Corsola. However, they do not fulfill those roles in the Galar region, having not realized the branches of Corsola are delicious.</description>

In the anime, Mantine protects Remoraid`s offspring, while the parent Remoraid help the Mantine in tough decisions. Mantine swims in open sea, participating in schools. Its large and well-developed wings enable it to briefly leap over the sea`s surface if it builds up enough speed, in a manner similar to some real aquatic species. Mantine is a filter feeder, like whales; its diet consists of most things that happen to enter its mouth while swimming.</description>

Individual members of the pack approach the intended target from different spots and begin the hunt. They then communicate their location to each other using special howls, ensuring that the victim is eventually surrounded and unable to escape.</description>

Houndoom is a feared predator among Pokémon, with its howl being likened to the howl of the Grim Reaper in legend. Just the sound of its howl is enough to send all other Pokémon which hear it hurrying back to the safety of their nests.</description>

<description>Smeargle is the painter of the Pokémon world, best known for its unique "Sketch" attack. It has a long tail that ends in a tuft of fur similar to a paintbrush. The tuft is continuously soaked by a special fluid secreted from the tip of the tail. The color of the fluid is predetermined for each Smeargle. The fluid is used to mark the boundaries of its territory and print its footprints on the backs of its fellows once they reach maturity. Over 5,000 distinctive marks left by the species have been found in the Pokémon world.
Smeargle has its "Sketch" technique, which is unique to Smeargle. When used, it will replace itself permanently with the last attack technique used by an opponent Pokémon against Smeargle. It learns Sketch every ten levels. There are a few attacks Sketch cannot copy, (Such as Chatots main attack Chatter) but it can learn nearly every attack in the game.</description>

Before Torchic`s legs develop fully, it stays with their Pokémon trainer, following behind with unsteady, hopping steps while it learns to walk properly. It attacks by spitting 1,800 degree fire formed in a special pouch in its stomach. This pouch constantly heats its body, allowing it to give "warm hugs." It dislikes darkness due to not being able to see its surroundings.
In the anime, May choses a playful Torchic as her starter Pokémon because she considers it to be cute. She often uses it in battles, but avoids using it in Pokémon Contests until it evolves.</description>

Combusken`s legs are both fast and powerful, and to keep them at peak physical condition, many run through nearby fields and mountains to stay agile and strong. By doing this, Combusken can kick up to 10 times per second, not giving up easily. Like Torchic, Combusken has a place within its body that stores and produces incredibly hot flames, It allows it to spew flames from its beak and to kick continuously until an opponent either faints or gives up.
In the anime, May owned a Combusken that evolved from her Torchic to protect Ash`s Corphish, and it later evolved into a Blaziken.</description>

When Pelipper spots its prey, it dips its large beak into the water and scoops it up. It then proceeds to swallow it whole. Pelipper also carries the eggs of its Wingull offspring inside its beak before and after they hatch. This provides the offspring with protection and, after they hatch, nourishment from the hunted food.</description>

Gardevoir has psychic powers including telekinesis and telepathy, and it also has the ability of precognition, enabling it to see into the future to detect incoming dangers. It moves by levitating itself, and can ignore gravity. Its powers are strong enough to the point where Gardevoir can disrupt the space-time continuum. By doing so, it can create a miniature black hole. Gardevoir has an unparalleled sense of concern for its Pokémon trainer, such that it will even give its own life for its trainer. The psychic powers that Gardevoir wields are at its height when it is protecting its trainer from a threat. In Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire and Pokémon Emerald, Wally uses a Gardevoir in the final battle in Victory Road.
Gardevoir also appears as a major character in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team.</description>

<description>Surskit is a bug-like species of Pokémon based on the water strider insect. It was introduced in the third generation of Pokémon media in the fictional Hoenn region. Surskit frequents lakes and ponds, and it has the ability to walk, or at least glide, on the water`s surface thanks to an oily substance secreted from the tips of its feet which modifies the water`s surface tension, thus allowing the water to support its weight. Surskit`s diet consists of the microscopic organisms that are found at the base of a lake ecosystem`s food chain. Surskit can also secrete a thick, sweet syrup resembling honey from the tip of its head. This sap is said to appeal to some species of Pokémon such as Heracross. Surskit usually secretes the syrup when it finds itself in danger. The exact reasoning behind this is unclear, but it may aim at attracting Pokémon which will drive the danger away to lick the syrup off Surskit`s head.</description>

It is thought that Makuhita regularly train in the secluded environs of a cave, and people around these caves have often reported hearing rumbling tremors from within the caves. Its body training is noted to always be accompanied by ample food consumption and sleep, for it is the goal of a Makuhita to gain enough weight and body mass to evolve into its bigger, fatter form of Hariyama.</description>

<description>Sableye lives in deep underground caves, where it leads a quiet life. It is a lithovore, meaning that its diet consists of rocks and minerals, which it uncovers from the ground using its sharp claws. When its body becomes saturated with substances derived from the rocks it eats, those substances crystallize and rise to the surface of its body, giving it a gem-studded appearance. Despite its hermetic lifestyle, Sableye is a cause of fear for many thanks to its eyes, which glitter eerily in the darkness of the caves it inhabits. In the Pokémon world, it is thought that a Sableye can steal a person`s spirit when its eyes shine that way. There is no attack type that is super effective on it, making it the first Pokémon without a weakness and the only such Pokémon until Spiritomb arrived in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.</description>

<description>Carvanha`s name originates from the words "carve" and "piranha". Its Japanese name is a portmanteau of 牙 (kiba), fang, and the English word "piranha". Another possible origin is "carnivore" which means meat or flesh eater. Referring to its evolution, Sharpedo, the name Carcharias (a genus of sharks) is possibly an influence to carvanha`s name.</description>

<description>Wailord is a gigantic, oceanic mammal with the largest known size of all Pokémon. Living in the vast oceans of the Pokémon world, Wailord swims languorously in pods of about four members or more, often at the surface so it can breathe through its upper nostrils. With huge mouths these Pokémon can eat massive amounts of undersea food, such as krill, in a single gulp. When chasing somewhat larger prey, Wailord herd them by leaping out of the water and making humongous splashes in what is often described as a breathtaking display. If a Wailord inhales to the maximum capacity of its gigantic lungs, it is able to dive close to 10,000 feet below the surface. Optionally by puffing itself up, it can float high on the ocean surface or beach on a shoreline if it wishes.</description>

<description>Torkoal exhales an always present cloud of smoke through its nostrils and through holes in its body and has a dark gray stone shell. It also consumes coal. Torkoal fills the hollows in its shell with coal and burns it - its strength is diminished without this supply. It will search through whole mountains to find it. If attacked, this Pokemon spouts thick black smoke in order to retreat. If this is not possible, this Pokémon needs more coal for energy. It lets off a sound that is similar to a locomotive`s horn when emitting smoke from its nostrils.
In the anime, Ash and friends help protect a Torkoal from the guardian of the place which consists of a Steelix. After saving it, Ash captures it. His Torkoal displays a large amount of affection for him and usually starts crying at random moments since it has low self esteem and usually does everything wrong, like diving into the ocean. Upon his return to Kanto to participate in the Battle Frontier, Ash left Torkoal and Glalie with Professor Oak.</description>

<description>Barboach lives in muddy areas of riverbeds. It probes this mud with its whiskers before deciding where to bury itself underneath the level of the mud, so that it remains motionless while its top whiskers are poking above the surface. The whiskers act as a superb radar system in this position, for Barboach detects its prey in the area using its whiskers to sense disturbances in the air.
Barboach`s body is covered with a slimy film, which is an important measure of discouraging both bacteria and predators from targeting Barboach. Whenever Barboach is partially submerged in mud, the film functions as a barrier to prevent germs in the mud from entering Barboach`s otherwise thin, unprotected body. Also, if a predator attempts to grab it, the Pokemon effortlessly slips out of its grasp as if it were a bar of wet, flexible soap like the real world Hagfish. It would seem that Barboach`s body depends on keeping its slimy coating layer thick and fluid with the influence of muddy water because the Pokemon`s body weakens if the coating dries up.</description>

Those that see it are said to forget their combative spirits right away; in particularly strong cases of anger, however, a Milotic`s body can glow a vivid pink and release a pulsing wave of energy that brings soothing calm to the restless spirits of the people and Pokémon involved.
The evolution of Feebas into Milotic is unique within the Pokemon video games, in that a Feebas will only evolve into Milotic when its Beauty condition is sufficiently high.</description>

<description>Castform is a small, rather unique Pokémon that resembles a cloud. It might be used like a satellite dish to sense upcoming weather changes.
It is distinct from other Pokémon in that its water-like cellular structure is affected by the weather, to the extent that its type and appearance change in extreme conditions. In intense sunlight, Castform becomes a Fire-type Pokémon that resembles an orange, stylized sun sitting atop a white cloud; in the rain, it becomes a Water-type and looks like a water drop sitting on a gray cloud; and in hail, it turns purple and is encased in a green, tornado-shaped cloud. In all other weather conditions, Castform retains its original typing and appearance. Castform`s mood is also influenced by the weather.
Like Porygon and Mewtwo, Castform is one of few human-made "artificial" Pokémon. It was created by the researchers of the Weather Institute in the Hoenn region as an experiment in weather forecast and manipulation. Its man-made nature is reflected in its uniform stats, all of which have a really average value.
It is the only Pokémon with the Forecast ability and one of two that learns the move Weather Ball (the other Pokémon capable of learning Weather Ball is Roserade via Move Tutor in Pastoria City). Both are influenced by the weather, regardless of how it`s set up (Castform does not personally need to change the weather for it to be affected).
Castform can naturally learn three weather moves which changes the typing of Castform and Weather Ball: Sunny Day (Fire), Rain Dance (Water), and Hail (Ice). It will become the type of the move, (having the same weaknesses and resistances), and Weather Ball will do that type of damage. It can also learn, by using a TM, Sandstorm. While Castform will not transform into a Rock-type during a Sandstorm, Weather Ball will do Rock-type damage. In Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, if Shadow Sky is used, Castform doesn`t change, but its Weather Ball damage is identical to Shadow Pokémon moves having no weakness or resistance. In all extreme weather, Weather Ball`s power is doubled.
Weather Ball also becomes even more powerful in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl because of the new attack changes. It is now a Special move regardless of its typing, so it depends on the Special Attack rating rather than the Attack rating (which was originally used for Normal- and Rock-type moves).</description>

<description>Relicanth is a rare and inaccessible Pokémon, as it inhabits the deep ocean floor. Once thought to be extinct, it was discovered in an exploration mission of the sea abyss. Relicanth proved to be extremely well-adapted to its environment; so much so, that according to researchers in the Pokémon world, it has not changed form in 100,000,000 years. Relicanth`s body is covered in rock-like scales which are tough enough to withstand the enormous hydrostatic pressures exercised on it at such extreme depths, as is the case with other dwellers of the abyss. It uses its multiple pectoral fins as a means of locomotion across the sea bed. It is based on the real fish, the Coelacanth.</description>

Even though this Pokémon`s shell is heavy, it makes up for it by drawing in its stubby legs and rolling around. This shell is very thick and strong, similar to bones. The shell protects disruption of its internal cell development. When it is finally ready for evolution, its shell sheds instantly. While in this stage of its evolution, Shelgon fasts in order to grow hardier from hunger. It grows tired easily due to its lack of food and its heavy shell weighing it down.</description>

<description>Kyogre is one of a trio of legendary Pokémon, alongside Groudon and Rayquaza. Kyogre represents Pokémon Sapphire and appears on the cover art for the game. Kyogre represents the primal force of the oceans; as such, it has the power to bring forth storms, constant rain and massive floods. It is part of the creation myth of the Pokémon world. According to legend, a titanic battle between it and Groudon created the oceans and the land, and the two were sealed beneath their respective elements. Despite being the creator of the oceans, Kyogre still came and helped Manaphy when it needed help as any other regular Pokémon would. Kyogre is similar to an orca or killer whale. It is a Water-type with the ability Drizzle, which makes the weather rainy until another weather move is used or a Pokémon with another weather altering ability is switched in.
In Pokémon Sapphire, Team Aqua tries to awaken and control Kyogre. It is awakened by a blue orb that the group actively seeks. They eventually awaken Kyogre, but they are stopped by the player in the video games. Kyogre made its first movie appearance in the ninth Pokémon movie, Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea. In the movie, Kyogre helps Ash, May, Pikachu, and Manaphy to protect the Sea Temple and defeat The Phantom.</description>

Drifloon and its evolution are the only two Pokémon that are ghost- and flying-type. Its classification as the `Balloon` Pokémon is shared with Igglybuff and its evolutions Jigglypuff and Wigglytuff as well as the water/poison Pokémon Qwilfish. The creature appears in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, and the episode "Drifloon on the Wind" where it belongs to a Nurse Joy and her two daughters, Marnie (Sayaki) and Paige (Mai).

<description>Bonsly is a small pot-like creature resembling a bonsai tree. The creature was introduced in 2004 in an issue of Coro Coro Magazine. Bonsly makes its proper and most playable debut in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, the game it was first advertised as being involved in.
Despite its tree-like appearance, Bonsly is actually made of rock. Bonsly often shed tears, though it has been found out that those are "fake tears", and that it is adjusting its body fluid level (appropriately enough, it can learn the move Fake Tears, which sharply decreases its target`s Special Defense) Wild Bonsly exist only in the Pearl Version, and upon learning how to Mimic, they evolve into the familiar Sudowoodo.
Its first anime appearance is in the eighth Pokémon movie, Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. However, its name is mispronounced in that movie; Bonsly is to be pronounced similarly to "bonsai", half of its namesake, the other being sly, for shedding "crocodile tears" Bonsly also appears in the "From Cradle to Save" episode, where Brock obtains it. Brock`s Bonsly eventually evolved into Sudowoodo.
Although regarded as a 4th generation Pokémon, it was included in the 2005 game Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, where the player must rescue one from the wreckage of S.S. Libra and reunite it with its trainer, a small girl. It also appears as a statue in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon as a reward.</description>

<description>Happiny are an exclusively female Pokémon that resemble Nurse Joy, with 3 round curls on their foreheads and a ponytail on top of their hair. The resemblance to Nurse Joy is probably linked to the fact its evolved forms (in the anime at least) work with Nurse Joy. Happiny like to carry egg-shaped objects in their pouches, imitating Chansey and Blissey, the Pokémon they may eventually become. This behavior is more than just play, however; a Happiny will evolve if it holds an Oval Stone upon leveling up during the daytime. In the Pokémon Diamond and Pearl games, Trainers are given a Happiny Egg to hatch and care for as they tour Hearthome City, home of Sinnoh`s Contest Hall. More Happiny can be hatched if their evolved forms hold Luck Incense during the breeding process in Solaceon City.
Happiny first appeared in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. In the episode "All Dressed Up With Somewhere To Go", Brock acquires an egg, which later hatches into a Happiny in "One Big Happiny Family!" there are rumours on internet forums saying that Happiny may evolve into Chansey and that this may bring about the end of Brock`s time on Pokemon breeding and traveling with Ash and co. If this was to happen then perhaps Max from the Hoenn series may return as the "informer" character having begun his own Pokemon journey. This however has no factual basis and is just a theory.</description>

<description>Munchlax is the pre-evolved form of Snorlax. It wolfs down its weight in food once a day, swallowing food whole with almost no chewing. It hides food under its long body hair. However, it sometimes forgets it has hidden the food there. Munchlax behaves quite opposite of its evolution, Snorlax, as it is somewhat hyperactive, though it is very similar with its eating patterns. It does not mind walking and running from place to place as it looks for food. Munchlax eats the most food of any Pokémon besides its evolution, Snorlax. It will eat nearly anything. It can rarely become full and will eat constantly, unlike Snorlax, who eats in between sleeping.
One can obtain a Munchlax by breeding two Snorlax with the mother holding a Full Incense, or by smearing honey on trees and waiting to see if it appears. However, it is the rarest Pokémon to catch by doing so. Wild Munchlax can only be found in honey trees in the games.</description>

<description>Magnezone, known as the Magnet Area Pokémon, is the evolution of Magneton, and has an appearance similar to that of a UFO. Magneton evolves from exposure to a unique magnetic field, which can only be found inside Mt. Coronet in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. This causes a mutation in the Magneton; one of the Magnemite that this Pokémon consists of has grown bigger than the other two; its pupil has dilated and turned red; and the screw on top appears to have been replaced by a yellow antenna upon evolution. The remaining Magnemite form the "shoulders" of Magnezone, and the screws on the top of their head have grown significantly larger. They also appear to have lost one magnet each. Magnezone has three horse-shoe magnets. Two are positioned in a fashion that resembles a pair of claws, and a third is positioned as a tail. Its body is surrounded by a thin metal rim. It is approximately three times heavier than Magneton. The body has a silver color like Magnezone`s pre-evolved forms. "Magneton must level up in Mt. Coronet in order to evolve"
In Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Darkness, a Magnezone serves as the police chief, taking away the outlaws the main character defeats.</description>

<description>Glaceon, known as the Fresh Snow Pokémon, is one of two evolutions of Eevee that is obtained from training it in a certain location, the other evolution being Leafeon. The location necessary to evolve Eevee into Glaceon is on route 217 in the Sinnoh region. There is an ice covered rock here, but it is also possible to level up anywhere in grass on route 217 to evolve. Being an ice-type, it prefers cold climates, and as a protective measure it freezes its fur completely. This freezing causes the hair to resemble "ice needles."
In the Anime, May`s Eevee evolved into a Glaceon prior to her reappearance in the episode 544 `Restaurant Seven Stars! Tag Battle for a Full Course!` and Bianca got a same Eevee and now evolved into Glaceon nicknamed Iceshocker.</description>

<description>Sakaki is the head of Team Rocket, and formerly served as the Gym Leader of Viridian City`s Gym, known officially as the Viridian Gym. He handed out the Earth Badge to Trainers who defeated him. As a Gym Leader, he specialized in Ground-type Pokémon, but his master plan includes collecting rare Pokémon of all types.
Very little is known about his past in any timeline; he is generally shrouded in mystery. However, certain things are known:
His mother was the head of Team Rocket before him. However, this is presumed to be canon in the anime timeline only, as the games have no precedent for this.
While Sakaki very rarely takes the role of antagonist, his agents often have him in mind during missions due to the chance of power, be it through promotion or other means. This gave him a unique series of appearances, mainly during the Hoenn saga, where Nyarth often saw how the Pokémon in each episode could be used to help Sakaki and win the trio promotions. These boss fantasies never show his actual personality and occasionally even show Sakaki in chibi form.
The only time Sakaki has been seen in battle was in The Battle for the Badge. He used powerful Pokémon against Shigeru but later left the Gym to deal with an unexplained emergency, leaving Satoshi to battle Musashi. By the time Satoshi returned from Hoenn, Agatha was in charge of the Gym until a new leader could be found. Sakaki`s reasons for leaving it have not been explained, though it is speculated to be linked with the events of the aforementioned episode.
Sakaki is one of the three most prominent figures speculated to be Satoshi`s father, alongside Professor Okido and Silver. There is no evidence to support this, though Diamondshippers see Sakaki`s avoidance of Satoshi mentioned above as suspicious. In Pokémon Live!, it was claimed that Sakaki and Delia had shared a relationship as teenagers, though it is also stated that someone else is Satoshi`s father in that particular canon.</description>

<description>Jessie is one half of of the Team Rocket duo that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokemon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
Jessie`s mother, Miyamoto, was a high-ranking Team Rocket agent. When Jessie was around the age of three, Miyamoto left on a mission to the Andes Mountains to record the voice of the elusive Pokemon Mew. However, Miyamoto disappeared, and Jessie was put into a foster home which had very little money. There were times when she had no choice but to eat snow because of a lack of more nourishing food.
When she was old enough, she left home to become a Pokemon nurse in Jouto. However, the school she was enrolled in was literally for Pokemon nurses (i.e. Chansey), so she failed to graduate and left, leaving behind a Chansey she had befriended there. It is assumed that she then traveled back to Kanto, where she enrolled in Pokemon Tech, a trainer`s school, met James, and subsequently failed and dropped out. After this, Jessie and James joined a bicycle gang in Sunny Town, where Jessie was known for swinging a chain above her head as she rode her bike (nicknamed "Chainer Jess").
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between Jessie and James after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Sometime before joining Team Rocket, and it is not known when, Jessie obtained a Contest Pass in the Hoenn region. Also during the years before Team Rocket, she had several boyfriends, all of whom left her and/or treated her badly. In "Xatu the Future", she revealed that she had once worked at a T.V. station as the Weathergirl. In "From Cradle to Save" is also revealed that she once was a ninja.
She has a long-standing bitter rivalry with Cassidy, another member of Team Rocket. Another member, Wendy, held a grudge against Jessie for failing to pay for a drink (making Wendy pay), but got her revenge when she added the charge to Jessie`s overall Team Rocket bill.
In the episode "Ignorance is Blissey", Jessie was reunited with her friend Chansey from the Pokemon nurse school; Chansey had since evolved into a Blissey.
Starting in Hoenn, Jessie has become a Pokemon Coordinator, entering every contest that she could. She frequently makes it to the battle round, but usually loses there. However, in "Borrowing on Bad Faith", she finally succeeded in winning an (unofficial) contest by using Ash`s Aipom, which she had saved earlier in the episode. And, in "Team Shocker!", she finally wins an official contest with her Dustox in at Solaceon City. Later she also won a ribbon with help of her Yanmega. She has Contest Passes to compete in the Hoenn, Kanto, and Sinnoh regions.
While Jessie`s role in the Pokemon anime has not yet ended, in Toshihiro Ono`s manga, "The Electric Tale of Pikachu", she ended up married to James and with child.
Jessie seems to have a special preference for snake-like Pokemon, owning both an Arbok and a Seviper. In "The Ninja Poke Showdown", she expressed a preference for Poison-type Pokemon in general.
For unknown reasons, she, James and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation.
In the Kanto contests, Jessie disguises herself as Jessebella (which is similar to James former fiancee Jessiebelle) wearing a red dress and glasses. Eventually, Ash, Brock, Max and May finds out her true identity at the last contest.
During the Kanto Grand Festival, Jessie dresses up as Jessadia (Japanese: キャンディ・ムサリーナ Candy Musalina). and wears glasses, long white socks, a yellow and orange dress, and has her hair in pigtails. She works there as an announcer and Lilian Meridian`s assistant; Lilian herself says she may not really like "Jessadia"`s style, but recognizes her talent. In the Latin American dub, she enters Super Contests under the name Jessiebella (referencing Jessiebelle again). Jessie currently still continues to use the Jessalina disguise while participating in Super Contests.
In "Pruning a Passel of Pals!" and "Strategy With a Smile!" she once again used her Jessadia disguise to report on the Wallace Cup.
Although Jessie had entered mostly every contest in Hoenn &amp; Kanto, she lost in every single one, whether it was the first match of the Battle Rounds or the finals. But in the Sinnoh Region, she has so far won 2 ribbons using her Dustox and Yanmega.</description>

<description>Meowth is a very unique Pokémon as it has many of the characteristics of a human. It walks on two feet, talks and is as smart as any human. Meowth is currently a member of Team Rocket and he travels around with Jessie and James trying to capture Pikachu and other rare Pokémon for Giovanni.
Meowth generally finishes his sentences with "Nyaa (ニャー)" which is the equivalent of "meow" in English. This helps people remember that despite his ability to talk like a human, he still has cat character traits.
Meowth is also known for coming up with his many schemes to try to capture Pikachu. While Jessie and James always agree with Meowth and think his plans are brilliant, they are generally foiled by Ash and his friends.
Long Con to Access Raimon City Pokémon Center
Meowth schemed with Jessie, James and Doctor Zager to figure out a way for them to infiltrate the Raimon City Pokémon Center where high-leveled Pokémon are stored in a vault that is protected by a security machine scan system that would only open if Nurse Joy (Isshu) or Nurse Joy`s Audino were scanned. Meowth pretended to be no longer part of Team Rocket making up a story that his made an error while executing a certain operation and when headquarters hear of his mistake, they told him he was fired.
Ash, Iris and Cilan believed him and allowed Meowth to travel with him. Pikachu though didn`t trust Meowth even though Meowth proved on numerous occasion that it should be trusted. Meowth`s plan was put into action when they arrived at the Raimon City Pokémon Center and as soon as Nurse Joy`s Audino was scanned to open the door, Meowth turned on Pikachu and the other and captured all the Pokémon in the vault. The long con had been a success and Meowth met up with Jessie and James below the Pokémon Center. Unfortunately, they weren`t able to get away as Ash and his friends realized that Meowth had just been conning them and they were able to stop Team Rocket.</description>

<description>James is one part of of the Team Rocket trio that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokémon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
James is mostly a comedic parody of bishounen characters; the English dub in particular tends to give him a melodramatic and even campy tone. He is somewhat famous for carrying a rose, though in more recent episodes he does not display it often. Mostly, his rose is displayed in the Team Rocket motto.
The only child of millionaires, James was forced to endure formal society. At a young age, he was forcefully engaged to a girl of whom he was terrified, Jessiebelle, all because his parents wanted to have a wealthy daughter-in-law. Thus, he ran away from home, leaving behind his beloved pet Growlie. He attempted to enroll in Pokémon Tech, a trainer`s school, but, along with his new friend Jessie, flunked out. Then, with Jessie, he joined the Sunny Town bicycle gang, where he was popular for being the only gang member to have to use training wheels (nicknamed "Trainer Jim"). Eventually James, Jessie, and the bike gang went their separate ways.
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between James and Jessie after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Since he is proficient in several activities, including Pokémon haiku and PokéRinger, it is possible that he developed his skills during his temporary separation from Jessie, but this is not known for sure.
In the episode "Holy Matrimony!", James returned to his home as a result of a trap by his parents, who pretended to be dead. He was reunited with his old pet Growlie and managed to avoid marrying Jessiebelle. Growlie stayed behind when James returned to Jessie and Meowth.
James has a tendency to be swindled by a Magikarp Salesman, who has on many occasions tricked him into buying a Magikarp or other useless Pokémon and items for large sums of money.
James also has a tendency to cross-dress, but has not done it since "Pros and Con Artists". He does, however, dress up like famous celebrities as well, such as Professor Oak, Juan, and Norman.
James loves rare bottle caps and has an impressive collection of them. In the episode "All That Glitters!" it is revealed that he has "drunk enough soda pop to float an aircraft carrier".
For unknown reasons, he, Jessie and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation. However in newer episodes the balloon is shown with `jets` attached to explain how they get from one place to another faster than walking.</description>

<description>The Beginning
Ash is the main character of the Pokémon anime. Raised in Pallet Town, he started his journey to become a Pokémon Master at the age of 10. On the day that he started his journey, Ash carelessly woke up late despite being told by his mother, Delia Ketchum to get to bed. He rushed to Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory only to find out that the beginner Pokémon - Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander - had already been given out to trainers who arrived on time. However, Professor Samual Oak mentioned that there was one more Pokémon available - Pikachu. Despite constantly hitting Ash with Electric-type attacks and refusing to return to its PokéBall, Ash decided to take Pikachu along with him on his journey to become a Pokémon Master. Pikachu is cold towards Ash at first and laughs at his failures; however, when Ash saves Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow, he begins to warm up to his new trainer and the two finally become friends. After the battle with the flock of Spearow, a Ho-Oh is seen flying towards a rainbow in the sky. The PokéDex reveals that the Ho-Oh is an unidentified Pokémon. Thus, the journey of Ash and Pikachu begins.
Captures in Viridian Forest
While making his way towards Pewter City and his first Kanto League Gym Battle, Ash came upon a wild Caterpie deep within Viridian Forest. Instead of using Pikachu to battle against the wild Pokémon, Ash took his chances and threw a PokéBall without weakining the Caterpie first. Luckily, he was able to catch the Pokémon without any trouble. The capture of Ash`s Caterpie marked Ash`s first capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Caterpie the second Pokémon to join his team.
The next day, while continuing the trek through the Viridian Forest, Ash came up on a wild Pidgeotto. He tried to just throw a PokéBall like he did with Ash`s Caterpie, but Pidgeotto swatted the PokéBall away. Misty informed that he must weaken the Pokémon first before attempting to capture it. He called out Ash`s Caterpie to battle against, but Misty quickly informed him that Bug-type Pokémon are weak against Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeotto. After Pidgeotto dealt significant damage to Ash`s Caterpie, Ash recalled it and sent out Pikachu. Pikachu was able to use its Thundershock to weaken Pidgeotto and allow Ash to capture it with a PokéBall. Thus, this capture marked Ash`s second capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Pidgeotto the third Pokémon to join his team.
Later on, while still in the Viridian Forest, Ash was approached by Team Rocket, who attempted to steal his Pokémon. After defeating Meowth, James`s Koffing, and Jessie`s Ekans, Ash`s Caterpie evolved into Ash`s Metapod.
Some of Ash`s greatest accomplishments have been at the various Pokémon Leagues. He was the victor at the Orange League and the Battle Frontier. He also competed in the Indigo League and the Johto Silver Conference where he placed admirably in both those competitions as well.
Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup
Ash participated in the Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup at the Kagome Town stadium. In the first round he was in the fifth match and faced off against Marris. The match was quickly showcased and Ash won the battle and advanced to the second round while Marris was eliminated from the tournament.
The Isshu League
Ash participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where he was matched up against Trip. Trip`s Serperior was sent out to battle Pikachu and Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior`s speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter Trip`s Serperior speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round. The two met in the Pokémon Center after the battle, and Trip vowed that the next time they met that he would win. The two shook hands and parted ways.
In the first main round, Ash`s opponent was shown on the match up electronic board but not much else is known about the battle. Ash`s Scraggy participated in the second main round of the Isshu League tournament where it faced off against a Darumakka. It was able to defeat it so that moved on to the next round.
In the third round, Stephan was matched up against Ash. Cilan noted that the two of them have a very direct taste and that it would be a good battle. It was only a 3 on 3 battle but the both of them gave it their all. The first two battles of the third round setup the final match up of Stephan`s Sawk vs Ash`s Krookodile, both of which were very injured from the previous battles. Both of them did their best to muster up their reserve strength but in the end a surprise move of Aerial Ace by Ash`s Krookodile was super effective against Stephan`s Sawk and it knocked it out to give Ash the victory while eliminating Stephan from the tournament. Stephan realized after the battle that the reason that Ash withdrew Waruvial after the first battle was because Ash knew that Stephan would definitely send out Dageki, so he didn`t reveal that it knew Aerial Ace and saved until the end.</description>

<description>The Beginning
On the morning that Ash was to start his Pokémon journey, he woke up late and by the time he reached Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory, all of the beginner Pokémon were already taken. However, Professor Samual Oak did have one Pokémon left, a wild Pikachu. At first, Pikachu did not like Ash and would refuse to enter his PokéBall. He would often laugh at Ash`s failures and refused to listen to him. However, after Ash proved his loyalty to Pikachu by protecting him from a flock of Spearow, and thus began to earn Pikachu`s trust and respect. The two have since become best friends and Pikachu never leaves Ash`s side.
Since the day Team Rocket first encountered Pikachu, it has been their sole goal to capture it. Day after day, their plan to capture Pikachu has been thwarted mainly due to Pikachu`s amazingly powerful Thunderbolt that keeps on blasting them off.
On numerous occasions, Pikachu has made it evident that he is happy being a Pikachu and has no desire to evolve into a more powerful Raichu. It has proven time and time again that it is a powerful and worthy opponent to any Pokémon that dares to battle it.
Gym Battle against Burgh`s Leavanny
Pikachu was then sent out to battle Burgh`s Leavanny. Burgh`s Leavanny managed to tie up Pikachu with String Shot but unlike Ash`s Swadloon who was able to break free, Pikachu ended up getting hit with a couple of Leaf Storm attacks and a Hyper Beam before it rolled into another of Burgh`s Leavanny`s Leaf Storm attacks to break the string off its body so it could attack. Freed from the String Shot, Burgh`s Leavanny tried to tie it up again but Pikachu managed to avoid it with its speed and then knocked Burgh`s Leavanny out with a combination of Iron Tail and Electro Ball.
Gym Battle against Elesa
Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy and was then matched up with Pikachu. Pikachu made quick work of Elesa`s Emolga and knocked it out with one attack, its Iron Tail.
Elesa`s Tynamo was the last Pokémon that she used in her gym battle against Ash. It was matched up against Pikachu who had just defeated her Emonga. Pikachu had a hard time defending against the fast Tackle attack that Elesa`s Tynamo kept hitting it with but Pikachu used its Thunderbolt to create a large dust cloud leaving only a small corridor for Pikachu to focus on it and so Elesa`s Tynamo couldn`t maneuver out of the way. Pikachu one hit K.O`d Elesa`s Tynamo with a Iron Tail. The loss gave Ash the overall victory.
Battle against Alder`s Bouffalant
Ash challenged Alder to a battle and he accepted though he had been walking all night and was actually quite tired. Alder sent out his Buffron to battle Pikachu but just as the battle started, Alder fell asleep standing up and didn`t give any orders to his Buffron. Alder`s Bouffalant stood still as Pikachu began hitting it with attack after attack until it Alder`s Bouffalant finally got mad at Alder and charged at him and set him flying into a tree. After that, Alder`s Bouffalant no longer wished to battle and Alder conceded the battle.
Gym Battle against Skyla
In Skyla air battle simulation, Ash`s Tranquill was matched up against Skyla`s Unfezant and since her Pokémon was the highest evolved form, she determined that her Pokémon would be the winner in that match-up. In the actual gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was up against Skyla`s Unfezant which was the match-up just after Ash`s Tranquill had defeated Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla`s Unfezant proved to be stronger and faster than Ash`s Tranquill, so Ash recalled it and set out Pikachu. Pikachu had a definite advantage over Skyla`s Unfezant with its electric attacks and it quickly knocked it out with its Electro Ball attack.
Ash Just after Pikachu ended up knocking out Skyla`s Unfezant, Skyla`s Swanna was sent out to battle against it. Skyla had been watching her grandpa`s battle videos and noticed that he used the move Aqua Ring to defend against Electric attacks. She used that same defense against Pikachu which nullified its Electric attacks. It`s Iron Tail also couldn`t hit it so high in the air. Ash then noticed the rings in the air and Pikachu jumped up on them and managed to hit Skyla`s Swanna but not directly. Pikachu was now up in the air though and Skyla`s Swanna had the advantage there and it quickly knocked Pikachu out with a powerful Brave Bird attack.
Battle Against Trip`s Serperior at the Isshu League
Pikachu participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where it is was matched up against Trip`s Serperior. Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter its speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round.</description>

<description>While Wobbuffet is technically Jessie`s Pokémon, it has been around so long that it has become a main character, appearing in almost every episode of the series since it debut.
Wobbuffet was first seen walking around with Benny, his previous trainer. Jessie traded her Lickitung for Wobbuffet and it has been with her ever since that day.
Wobbuffet rarely battles but when he does, his Counter and Mirror Coat moves have proved to be very effective. Unfortunately, Jessie`s tactics aren`t always sufficient to master Wobbuffet`s superior defensive skills.
Wobbuffet also randomly comes out of his Pokeball, especially during the Team Rocket motto. He is also seen blasting off with Jessie regardless if he was actually part of the action.</description>

<description>He is a Pokémon researcher that was once a competitive Trainer, and is generally considered the best in his field. As such, his role in the Pokémon games and anime is that of a mentor to young Pokémon Trainers, a source of information and an occasional plot device. Amongst other things, he is credited with inventing the Pokédex. He also hands out a Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander to beginning trainers (depending on which Pokémon the trainer chooses) to start their adventure in the Kanto Region. Although he is an expert on all matters relating to Pokémon, Professor Oak specializes in Pokémon behavioural science. He appears in Pokémon 4Ever as a child who was pulled into the future by Celebi. Additionally, it is apparent after Pokémon 3: The Movie that he knew Delia Ketchum since she was a child; this most likely is the reason he occasionally exhibits parental-type concern (mainly in the form of scolding Ash as he is doing something that is dangerous). He also creates poems centred around Pokémon and is known as the rhyming professor by Dawn.</description>

<description>Tepig is a Fire Pig Pokémon that resembles a pig and is one of the starter Pokémon for Pokémon Black and White versions. When hungry, it uses its flame to cook for its food. It blows fire from its nostrils, but this is replaced with smoke when it catches a cold. In an interview with Ken Sugimori, he stated that Tepig`s evolution would be Chinese style of design. Tepig`s original Japanese name is a portmanteau of "Pokapoka", a Japanese word that refers to the warm feeling that circulates repeatedly throughout a body, and "Buu", which refers to a pig`s sound.Tepig was the third Pokémon that Ash Ketchum caught in the Unova region. In the english version, he was voiced by Marc Thompson.
In the anime, Tepig was first seen in In the Shadow of Zekrom!, under the ownership of Professor Juniper, as one of the starter Pokémon to be chosen by Trip. One later appears as an unfortunate Pokémon that was left behind by its trainer in Battle Club, after being defeated in a challenge. Ash Ketchum befriended the Pokémon and captured it afterward. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Tepig, along with Oshawott and Snivy appear when Black accidentally drops his box containing the Pokémon. The Tepig eventually joins his team and is named "Poka", which is short for Tepig`s Japanese name, Pokabu. Tepig is Cheren`s starter Pokémon in the Pokémon Master Black &amp; White manga series.
The Escapist criticized Tepig`s evolution line for being another Fire/Fighting type starter. Game Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava criticized its name for possibly being a pun of "tepid", which means lukewarm. GamesRadar`s Carolyn Gudmundson criticized its evolutionary line; while she enjoyed the first form`s design, she felt that the final form was a disappointment, as well as the use of a combination of fire and fighting as its type, a type combination used for the last three fire starters. IGN`s Sam Claiborn chose Tepig as his starting Pokémon due to its final form which he described as a "bipedal pig demon".</description>

Whilst in the air Gengar uses Confuse Ray which makes Tauros attack the nearby rock and damage itself in the process. Ash quickly recalls Tauros and sends out Lapras in the water pool in the middle of the stage.
Lapras and Gengar battled each other and ended up eliminating each other when their attacks collided.
With Drake losing his third Pokémon there was a short interval whilst the battle field change into a sandy field.
Orange League Final - Vs. Ash Ketchum (Sand Field)
The interval ended and Drake began by choosing Venusaur whilst Ash brought Tauros back into the battle who had now recovered from Gengar`s Confuse Ray. Ash`s first move was to have Tauros stamp its feet to use Fissure, however, the soft sand absorbed the move. Drake took advantage of the situation by having Venusaur use Solarbeam but knowing Solarbeam takes a while to charge up, Ash have Tauros charge straight towards Drake`s Venusaur and flip it into the air just before it fired. Venusaur managed to adjust itself mid-air and fire the Solarbeam at Tauros. The impact was close to Tauros and knocked it down but it managed to recover and get back to its feet quickly.
Venusaur struck Tauros with one of its Vine Whip attacks but Tauros manage to avoid any further strikes and successfully land a Take Down move on Venusaur and eliminate it from the battle.
Drake sent out Electabuzz and Ash decided to give Tauros another rest and switched in Bulbasaur.
Tauros was switched in again after Ash recalled the eliminated Squirtle. Tauros charged into the middle of the field whilst Dragonite flew up and use Body Slam. To Drake`s surprise Ash told Tauros to stand its ground and endure the hit, which it does so successfully and even manages to throw Dragonite to the floor using its horns.
Dragonite get up and uses Thunderbolt which proves too much for Tauros and eliminates it from the battle leaving Ash with one Pokémon left.
After Ash had won the battle against Drake he called out all of his Pokémon that participated in the battle on the stage as Drake presented him with the Winner`s Trophy. Then Ash, Pikachu, Tauros, Lapras, Squirtle, Bulbasaur and Charizard all had their handprints set in stone to be remembered in the Orange Island Hall of Fame.</description>

Kanto Pokémon League Tournament
Round 4 - Vs Ash Ketchum - Grass Field
Despite looking like a weak opponent Jeanette`s Bellsprout managed to KO both Ash`s Bulbasaur and his Pikachu. Ash turned to Muk who he transferred from Prof. Oak just before the battle.
Due to Muk`s slow speed and bigger size it could not avoid Bellsprouts attack but thanks to its slimy and elastic body it was simply able to absorb them and not feel any damage. Bellsprout continued to launch a number of ounches, kicks and throws but still Muk absorbed them all. After repelling a Razor Leaf attack Muk smothered Bellsprout with its body and after a few seconds of struggling Bellsprout was defeated, giving Ash the victory and earned him a place in the final 16.
Please with its victory it gave Ash a hug which forced Ash to the ground. Ash laughed and praised Muk for giving him the victory.</description>

<description>Kanto Pokémon League Tournament
Round 4 - Vs Jeanette Fisher - Grass Field
Ash selected Bulbasaur as his first Pokémon whilst Jeanette choose her Beedrill. As the faster Pokémon, Beedrill charged at bulbasaur at full speed, however Bulbasaur mananged to evade and return a Razor Leaf attack. Once again Beedrill used its superior speed, avoiding the Razor Leaf attack whilst also getting itself in a good position to use a Twin Needle atttack on Bulbasaur. Despite being on the backfoot, Bulbasaur managed to dodge the Twin Needle attack and Beedrill`s Stinger. After jumping backwards, Bulbasaur created enough space to be able to use its Leech Seed attack which struck Beedrill on its attacking stinger. Beedril was stuck in Leech Seed forcing it to the floor and Ash had bulbasaur finish it off using a Tackle attack which gave Ash the Initial Advantage in the battle.
Like Beedrill, Scyther had an advantage in speed and used this by quickly trying to attack Bulbasaur with its blades. After beeing unsuccessful, Jeanette order Scyther to used a Swift attack which managed to hit Bulbasaur a few times and was useful in deflecting its Vine Whip attack. Jeanette ordered Scyther to use a Double Team attack to which Ash had Bulbasaur to attempt to hit the real Scyther. The attempt failed and Scyther was able to land a few strikes by charging at Bulbasaur and managed to evade Bulbasaur`s counter of a Razor Leaf and Vine Whip attack. Ash had Bulbasaur use its Vine Whip once more but told it to swing the vines towards all of the copies which Double Team created, knowing that Bulbasaur would have to hit the real one in the process. The plan worked and Scyther was struck by Vine Whip, eliminating it from the battle.
Jeanette released her final Pokémon of the round which was a Bellsprout. Her choice suprised her a few people including Bulbasaur, as by apperance alone Bellsprout could be considered a weak Pokémon.
Ash had Bulbasaur charge at Bellsprout but managed to flip it above its head using its own momentum against itself. Ash was stunned by Bellsprout`s agility. Bulbasaur was angered at being tossed aside so easily and charged once again at Bellsprout, but like before, was thrown away using its own momentum. Bellsprout took advantage of Bulbasaur being on the floor and thrown it towards Ash`s podium, showing great strength and eliminated Bulbasaur from the tie.
Ash quickly rushed Pikachu into battle to try and finish Bellsprout off.
Orange League Final - Vs. Ash Ketchum (Sand Field)
Bulbasaur was Ash`s fifth choice Pokémon in his winner`s trophy battle against Drake. Bulbasaur`s first opponent was against Drake`s Electabuzz.
Bulbasuar manage to shake of Electabuzz`s initial Thundershock attack and returned a Razor Leaf attack which struck Electabuzz, although, whilst being hit by Razor Leaf, Electabuzz manage to use a Thunderbolt attack that Bulbasaur quickly dodged.
Bulbasaur uses Tackle and causes some light damage to Electabuzz but taking advantage of how close Bulbasur was, it manage to hit Bulbasaur with a Thunderpunch which eliminated it.
After Ash had won the battle against Drake he called out all of his Pokémon that participated in the battle on the stage as Drake presented him with the Winner`s Trophy. Then Ash, Pikachu, Tauros, Lapras, Squirtle, Bulbasaur and Charizard all had their handprints set in stone to be remembered in the Orange Island Hall of Fame.</description>

<description>Charizard evolves from Charmeleon during a battle with Aerodactyl but still remains disobient to Ash.
Kanto Pokémon League:
Fifth Round - Vs Ritchie.
Ash gambled on using a disobient Charizard and he was trailing in the battle and his other Pokémon were tired.
Charizard originally appeared like it was not going to do anything but after Ritchie`s Charmander narrowly missed with a flamethrower, Charizard decided to fight back with a flamethrower of its own with panicked Charmander and forced Ritchie to recall it.
Pikachu was Ritchie`s third and final Pokémon in the battle and was against Ash`s Charizard which had just forced Charmander to be switched. Charizard trembled the ground with a couple of stomps making Pikachu lose its balance and then blew Pikachu away using a gust from its wings. Seemingly thinking Pikachu was not a worthy opponent, Charizard took a nap in the middle of a battle and despite Ash pleaded with it to battle, it was eliminated. This gave Sparky the victory over Charizard and put Ritchie into round six.
Ash angrily recalled Charizard into its ball.
Orange Islands.
Ash called upon Charizard to battle Tad`s Poliwrath which had a reputation of being a very strong Pokémon. Charizard refused to listen to Ash`s orders and Poliwrath shoots a water gun on Charizards tail making the flame much smaller, then a subsuquent Ice Beam hits Charizard and freezes it. The battle left Charizard very injured and Ash had to keep its tail flame alive much like he did when he first found it as a Charmander.
Despite an intial struggle, Charizard saw how much Ash cared for him and once it reached full health in the morning Charizard became friendly with Ash and even obeyed Ash during Battle.
Charizard then went on to defeat Tad`s Poliwrath in a re-match.
Orange League Final - Vs. Ash Ketchum (Sand Field)
Ash chose Charizard to battle against Electabuzz and ordered it to use Flamethrower against Electabuzz, who quickly jumped into the air and landed a Thunderpunch onto Charizard and follwowed up by shocking Charizard with an electric attack. Charizard managed to release himself from the electricity by firing a Fire Spin and then Charizard flew towards Electabuzz quickly making sure it could not use it Thunderbolt attack. Charizard got a good grip on Electabuzz and flew into the air and used Seismic Toss on it which eliminated it and left Drake with one Pokémon left.
Drake`s final Pokémon was his prized Dragonite who he sent out to battle Ash`s Charizard.
Charizard moved first by using a Flamethrower attack but Dragonite countered by using Water Gun which cuts through the Flamethrower and hits Charizard, who then takes to the skies whilst avoiding Dragonite`s Ice Beam.
Dragonite then takes to the sky itself showing great speed as it does so. Dragonite and Charizard exchange Ice Beam and Flamethrower attacks respectively but it is Dragonite who manages to clip Charizard wing using Ice Beam which send Charizard spinning to the ground. Charizard recovers and flies close to Dragonite in an attempt to use a Seismic Toss attack, however, Dragonite avoids and gets a good grip on Charizard which gives it the opportunity to use a Slam attack.
Charizard gets up quick although it is clearly tired but it has enough stength to launch a Dragon Rage attack. Dragonite uses the same move, the attacks collide and both Pokémon are sent flying backwards. When the dust settles both Pokémon are standing but exhausted from the previous battle, after a few deep breaths Charizard falls to the ground and is eliminated.
After Ash had won the battle against Drake he called out all of his Pokémon that participated in the battle on the stage as Drake presented him with the Winner`s Trophy. Then Ash, Pikachu, Tauros, Lapras, Squirtle, Bulbasaur and Charizard all had their handprints set in stone to be remembered in the Orange Island Hall of Fame.</description>

<description>Chansey enrolled at a school that was designed specifically for Chansey. It struggled at first but managed to befriend a Jessie who was taking the same course despite being a human. Jessie helped Chansey in its study and started to do well on the course unlike Jessie who could not stay awake during the Chansey`s Sing ability, which was used to lull restless Pokémon to sleep.
Just before Jessie left the college, the Chansey that she made friends with, which had just graduated managed to catch up with Jessie and tried to persuade her to finish the course. Jessie explained that she would not be able to finish the course and so Chansey snapped its graduation medal in half and get one half to Jessie as a token of their friendship.
During the next few years Chansey evolved into a Blissey and manage to land a nursing position in a Pokémon Centre in Happy Town in the Johto region despite remaining slightly clumsey and over-eager to help at times. Some time later it was reunited with Jessie when they met in a Pokémon Centre in Johto. Blissey tried helping Jessie by giving her the food that was stored in the Pokémon Centre.
Blissey was caught on the Pokémon security cameras taking food from the Pokémon Centre`s storeroom and faced losing its position as a nurse.
Jessie did not want Blissey to lose its dream job which it worked hard for so James, Meowth and herself claimed they tricked Blissey into giving the food away and even attacked Blissey to make it look convincing.
Ash Ketchum made Jessie, James and Meowth blast off but not before Jessie ensured the events at the Pokémon centre will be kept a secret. Blissey and Jessie kept their pieces of the graduation medal and remained friends.

<description>Trubbish is known as the Trash Bag Pokémon. It is said that a trash bag that is thrown away chemically reacted with waste to become this Pokémon. It likes dirty places such as waste deposits.
Despite finding Black and White`s Pokémon to be well-designed, IGN`s Audrey Drake found Trubbish and its evolution to be contrary to this. IGN AU`s Cam Shea mocked it, jokingly stating that nothing was cuter than an "anthropomorphic bag of garbage"; he jokingly suggested that they make similar Pokémon called "Mediwastical" and "Stinkydiaperino".</description>

<description>Garbodor is a Poison-type Pokémon introduced in Generation V.
It evolves from Trubbish starting at level 36. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Garbodor has the appearance of a pile of trash spilling out of a large, torn garbage bag. It has a round, lumpy body that is mostly tan with blue and pink lumps. Its head has the appearance of the tied end of a garbage bag that has been ripped open and trails down like a cape. It has two appendages that look like clumps of garbage coming from its head. Its large, round eyes have small pupils, and when it opens its mouth, its large, triangular teeth can be seen. Garbodor has two long arms made of garbage; one held together with piping, with fingers also made up of piping material, and the other held together with rebar. It has one finger on its left hand and three on the other. It also has flat, dumpy feet.
Garbodor is able to spray poisonous gas and filth from its fingertips, but only from its right hand. If that filth is blocked, its arm can swell up, causing it considerable pain and discomfort. It also finishes off opponents by subduing them with its left arm and spewing an awful-smelling toxic gas from its mouth. Garbodor prefers to live in unsanitary places such as garbage dumps. Garbodor inhales garbage, which then becomes part of its body. The toxic liquid from its right arm is so virulent, it can kill a weakened foe instantly. Alola was once home to many Garbodor, but the population shrank precipitously after Grimer was introduced to its habitat. This is said to have made the remaining Garbodor population stronger than its counterparts from other regions. Alolan Muk preys on Garbodor.
As Gigantamax Garboodor, its size has increased with an altered look. The sclera in its eyes are dark pink. The feet disappear, with the lumpy body expanding. Several discarded toys appear on Garboodor. The toys are as follows: toy car, blocks, toy airplane, toy cruise ship, Substitute doll, Poke Doll, Master Ball, fish skeleton, and toy train. The spikes on its shoulder becomes longer. The right arm becomes bulkier. There is dark blue, pink, and light green spots all across its body. Three red clouds float around the head.
When Gigantamaxing, its toxic gas becomes thicker. This result in the gas taking a solid shape of discarded toys. Gigantamax Garbodor releases the gas through its mouth and fingers. Should the gas engulf someone, the toxin will seep deep in the bones.
Gigantamax Garbodor is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Malodor.</description>

<description>Herdier, known as the Loyal Dog Pokémon, is a dog-like Pokémon with particular similarities to a Yorkshire Terrier. Its face sports an abundance of cream fur, forming a "mustache" and a three-pointed crest of fur on its head. Its ears are large and perked, and it has a shaggy dark blue pelt on its body and tail. Its limbs are orange-brown. The black fur that covers its body like a cape is heavy, and softens the impact of attacks. Faithful to its trainer`s instructions, it has helped trainers raise Pokémon since long ago.
The Escapist commented that while much of the Pokémon in Pokémon Black and White look weird, "I will readily admit to wanting to hug that Yorkshire Terrier one, though. It`s just too cute!"</description>

- If Purple Nectar is used on Oricorio, it will change into Sensu Style, where it becomes Ghost/Flying-type.
Oricorio is an avian Pokémon that can change between four markedly different forms. All forms have a light pink beak, thin legs, and dark eyes with white pupils. The feet have three toes in front and one in back, and the beak curves downward.
In its Baile Style, Oricorio is covered in red feathers with two lines of black feathers across each of its wings and tail. Its plumage resembles a frilly flamenco dress. On the back of its head is a white ball with thin, spiraled extensions on either side that resemble earrings. Its eyelids are purple, and it has a long tail. Baile Style Oricorio is very passionate and exudes power when it dances. It throws off downy fluff when it dances that it can ignite to perform a fiery dance attack.
In its Pom-Pom Style, Oricorio is primarily yellow. Most of its body is pale yellow with a line of longer feathers around its waist like a skirt. Its lower body and short stubby tail are covered with short, white feathers. Fluffy balls of darker yellow feathers cover the end of its wings like pom-poms, and similar, smaller puffs cover its ankles. In the center of its chest is a yellow, v-shaped marking, and there are fan-shaped markings on the sides of its eyes. The markings around its eyes are echoed by three large, pale yellow feathers on each side of its head, which are tipped with bright yellow. Pom-Pom Style Oricorio`s dancing charges its feathers with static electricity. While charged, its feathers can be used to attack and unleash electric shocks. A friendly Pokémon, it will also use its dancing to cheer up people who are feeling glum.
In its Pa`u Style, Oricorio has pink feathers. Its main body is a dark pink, while most of its other feathers are varying shades of pink. A fan of three feathers tips each wing: two light pink with a whitish-pink on in the center. On top of its head is an arrangement of feathers resembling a headdress: a ring of fluffy, light pink feathers with larger, paler feathers standing up from the center. There is a larger, similar group of feathers around its waist like a skirt. Pa`u Style Oricorio can be difficult to deal with due to its laid-back nature. It uses its dance to focus its mind and increase its psychic power. The dance is also said to be an offering of thanks to its guardian deity.
In its Sensu-Style, Oricorio`s feathers are mainly purple. The tips of its wings broaden into a fan shape, and it has a fan-shaped crest on top of its head. At the base of its crest are four feathers with light blue tips. There are two of these feathers on each side, resembling ornamental hairsticks. On the side of each eye are small, light blue markings that resemble eyelashes. The edges of its wings, fans, head crest, and long tail all have a double border of pale purple with a light blue on the outer edge. Sensu Style Oricorio is a calm and collected Pokémon. Through its dance, it draws in nearby spirits and borrows their power to fight. Its dance reminds people who migrated from Kanto of their homeland.
Oricorio is the only known Pokémon that can learn Revelation Dance.</description>

<description>Cutiefly is a dual-type Bug/Fairy Pokémon.
It evolves into Ribombee starting at level 25.
Cutiefly is a tiny Pokémon with comparatively large wings. It has a pale yellow body with a white face and tail. It has large eyes with spots resembling pixels in them, a long brown nose, and two tiny transparent tufts on its head resembling antennae. The wings on its back are wide and flat. They are white with brown loop markings toward the bottom and have a white tuft of hair between them. It has four spindly legs with round feet.

As a result, Cutiefly tends to gather around beings feeling strong emotions. This Pokémon can be found in fields and meadows, but is sometimes attracted to towns or buildings by the emotions of living beings.</description>

<description>Ribombee is a dual-type Bug/Fairy Pokémon.
It evolves from Cutiefly starting at level 25.
Ribombee is a tiny, insectoid Pokémon with a large head, slightly smaller body, and thin arms and legs. It is covered in fluffy, yellow hair with a white face, hips, and a tuft of hair on its back. It has big eyes with a small, brown square speck in the lower half. Over its eyes a white hairs similar to eyelashes and it has two black antennae. Around its neck is a brown scarf with a needle-like projection on the front. Two wings nearly as large as its body sprout from its back. The wings are clear with three brown loop designs near the base. Its four thin limbs have bulbous hands or feet.
Ribombee uses its fluffy hair to hold pollen it collects from flowers. Rain causes its hair to become dirty, so it only visits fields if the weather will remain clear. The pollen and nectar its collects is used to form balls called "Pollen Puffs". Pollen Puffs have a variety of uses. These balls can be used as food, to attack and paralysis or dizziness, or even relieve tiredness with a soothing effect. The Alolan people sell Pollen Puffs as valuable supplements.</description>

<description>Rockruff is a Rock-type Pokémon.
It evolves into Lycanroc. The form it evolves into depends on the game it evolves in.
- In Pokémon Sun, Rockruff evolves into Midday Form Lycanroc when leveled up in the day starting at level 25.
- In Pokémon Moon, Rockruff evolves into Midnight Form Lycanroc when leveled up at night starting at level 25.

There are tales of it reuniting with its Trainer after becoming lost by following the faintest traces of scent. This Pokémon is very sociable and will greet others by rubbing them with the rocks around its neck. As it ages, Rockruff becomes wilder. Once it is close to evolving, it will begin to howl when the sun goes down. It has been said to leave its Trainer`s side and return once it has evolved. A persistent Pokémon, it will keep going until it outlasts foes that are even more powerful.</description>

<description>Lycanroc is a Rock-type Pokémon.
It evolves from Rockruff. The form it takes upon evolving depends on the game it was evolved in.
- In Pokémon Sun, Rockruff evolves into Midday Form Lycanroc when leveled up in the day starting at level 25.
- In Pokémon Moon, Rockruff evolves into Midnight Form Lycanroc when leveled up at night starting at level 25.
Lycanroc is a canine Pokémon resembling a wolf. It has two possible forms: a Midday Form and a Midnight Form.
In its Midday form, Lycanroc resembles a quadruped, light brown wolf. It has a white underbelly that extends up around its muzzle and eyes in a mask-like marking. It has pointed ears with dark brown tips and pink insides, big blue eyes, and a triangular, dark brown nose. There are four sharp fangs in its mouth: two in the upper jaw and two in the lower. Large tufts of brown fur extend from the sides of its head; three tufts on each side. A bushy, white mane covers its neck. Four dark brown rocks poke out of its mane, creating a shape similar to a stylized sun. The lower portions of this form`s legs are white, and each foot has three dark brown claws. It also has a long, fluffy white tail.
In its Midnight Form, Lycanroc instead resembles a slouched, bipedal wolf or werewolf. It has short red fur with white on its lower legs, and a white streak that covers its face, underbelly, and tail. It has pointed, button ears with black tips, three large tufts of fur on each side of its face, a triangular black nose, and a mouth full of sharp teeth. While the sclerae, irises, and pupils of its eye are visible, they all glow a pinkish red and no distinctive colors are visible. A mane of fur covers its back and shoulders, sweeping forward over its head to form a crescent moon shape. On either side of its body, just below the shoulders, two small rocks resembling claws poke out of the mane. A single, bigger stone projects out of the front of the mane over its head. Each of this form`s paws has three black claws, and it has a stubby tail covered in long fur.
In order to avoid needless fighting, the Midday Form prefers to live alone and does not form a pack with others of its kind. However, it is a fiercely loyal partner to Trainers that accept it during its unruly stage. In battle, it darts past opponents while attacking them with the rocks in its mane. These swift movements leave many foes bewildered.
In contrast, Lycanroc`s Midnight Form is thrilled by battling, and becomes more excited the stronger its opponent. This excitement is what causes its eyes to glow. Its strategy consists of closing in on its opponent and encouraging attack, then countering with a powerful blow that knocks out its opponent. Trainers that can draw out its power earn its trust, but it despises those that it disagrees with or who try to force it to fight.
Accelerock is the signature move of Lycanroc`s Midday form.</description>

<description>Wishiwashi is a Water-type Pokémon.
While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Wishiwashi can change forms with its Schooling Ability if it has reached level 20.
Wishiwashi is a fishlike Pokémon. Even though an individual Wishiwashi is small and weak, the people of Alola still fear it and call it the demon of the sea. This is because of Wishiwashi`s powerful School Form, formed when a Wishiwashi is in danger and calls on its friends by making its eyes shine in an SOS signal.
In its Solo Form, Wishiwashi resembles a small fish. It has large, light blue eyes with irises that resemble puddles of water and dark blue eyelids. The head and tail are both white. There is a line of white teardrop-shapes on each side of its body with the teardrop nearest the head being slightly larger. The top half of its body is dark blue and has a short, rounded dorsal fin. The lower half of its body is gray with two pectoral fins.
In its School Form, Wishiwashi resembles a large fish roughly formed from various smaller fish with glowing eyes. Starting with its head, its body is divided into four bands that each becomes a slightly darker shade of blue. A ring of bright blue glowing spots lines the front edge of the two middle bands. The centers of its "eyes" are formed by a single white fish with glowing eyes for pupils. Surrounding the white fish is a dark blue recess, and at the rear edge of the "eye" is a raised white area for eyelids. Above each eye is a single, dark blue fish shape. Wishiwashi`s mouth gapes wide open, apparently unable to close fully due to gaps on each side. Its lips in the front are lined with glowing spots, and many more spots dot the inside of its mouth.
On each side of the School Form`s body, in the second band, there is a pair of dark blue fish-shaped recesses. Wishiwashi is able to fire fish-shaped torpedoes from this area. Its pectoral fins are the same color as its head, and have three finger-like projections. There are glowing spots at the base of each "finger" and at the base of the fins themselves. On top of its head are two short projections shaped like fishtails, one behind the other. Additionally, Wishiwashi has a large dorsal fin that is darker around the base and has two glowing spots at the tip. The third section of its body has a ring of four spike-like fins around it. Three spikes encircle the tip of its tail, each with a two glowing dots at the base. Dark fish shapes float freely a short distance from the end of each spike, all with two more dots on them. Finally, the tip of its tail is a rounded teardrop-shape with a single dot on each side.</description>

<description>Mudbray is a Ground-type Pokémon.
It evolves into Mudsdale starting at level 30.
Mudbray is a quadruped, equine Pokémon resembling a small donkey. It has a dark brown coat with a cream-colored underbelly, muzzle, and circular markings on each cheek. A short, teardrop-shaped blaze extends up from its muzzle, and it has long, pointed ears with pink insides. Its large eyes have horizontal pupils. Black bangs hang over its face before turning into a stiff mane along its neck. Additionally, it has a short, black tail. Thick, cream-colored mud surrounds each black hoof.
Because it was hunted nearly to extinction when it lived all over the world, it is believed to run wild only in Alola. This Pokémon boasts immense strength for its size, and is able to drag or carry loads up to 50 times its own weight. If Mudbray has a place where it can frolic in the mud, it is happy. However, it becomes stressed and may become disobedient if denied this pastime.</description>

<description>Fomantis is a Grass-type Pokémon.
It evolves into Lurantis when leveled up in the day starting at level 34.
Fomantis is a small, plant-like Pokémon. It has large, dark pink eyes with slightly darker pupils. Tufts of light green hair surround its head. A particularly large tuft in front slightly overhangs its face. A small, dark green bulb sprouts from the center of its head. Around its neck is a collar of short, dark green leaves. Extending from its collar are four lighter green leaves with white tips: two in the front and two in the back. In the front, these leaves act as scythe-like arms. Its main body is pale pink with a thick, dark pink stripe down the front and back. It has a stubby tail and two short legs.
In order to achieve evolution, Fomantis stores up energy gathered by photosynthesis. It is nocturnal, so during the day it spreads its leaves wide to catch the sunlight. During the night, it spends its time searching for a new spot to sleep for the next day. It will not stay in the same spot for more than a day due to the danger involved. If anything bothers it while it is gathering sunlight, Fomantis will fiercely attack it. Though it excels at long-range attacks, it will rarely use those that require it to use its stored photosynthetic energy.</description>

<description>Lurantis is a Grass-type Pokémon.
It evolves from Fomantis when leveled up in the day starting at level 34.
Lurantis is an insectoid Pokémon with some plant-like features. The top half of its head is pink, while the bottom half is white. It has light red eyes and two green antennae with a small green lump between them. There are four extensions to the top half of its head: two on the top with red tips that resemble ears, and one on each side with white tips that are similar to stylized hair. It has a light pink body with short extensions around the waist and a green abdomen and neck. Its thin, white arms end in large, red scythes white along the bottom rim and a single green claw are the tip. There are vertical, pink-and-red stripes down its legs, which have small, pointed green feet. The coloring and shape of Lurantis`s body and arms give it the appearance of wearing a long-sleeved dress, while its legs are similar to pants. Four red, wing-like appendages sprout from its back, each tipped with white.
Lurantis both looks and smells like a flower, a trait that it exploits to lure in foes so it can spring a surprise attack. Its brilliant coloration and elegant moves earn it acclaim as the most gorgeous Grass-type Pokémon. Maintaining its appearance requires detailed grooming. If a Trainer does a good job caring for it, Lurantis will have an easier time trusting them than a lazy Trainer.</description>

It evolves into Shiinotic starting at level 24.
Morelull is a small, white Pokémon similar to a mushroom. It has large, black eyes with pale green half-circle markings on the outer side. Small bumps ring the top of its head, similar to hair.

In addition to locomotion, its roots are also used to make communicate with other Morelull. When in danger, it scatters spores that burst into bright, glittering sparks. The pulsing light of the spores can induce drowsiness. It is rumored that once, when a group of Morelull were disturbed and all threw out their spores at once, a plane passing overhead suffered a near brush with disaster.</description>

While fleeing danger, Bounsweet skips along in a way that does not convey its desperation. As a result, no one ever comes to help it. It has been known to drive away enemies by rotating its calyx, but it becomes dizzy afterward.</description>

The oil changes the flower so they emit a soothing fragrance that affects both Comfey and its allies. This aroma can also help with the treatment of people and Pokémon at hospitals.</description>

<description>Sandygast is a dual-type Ghost/Ground Pokémon.
It evolves into Palossand starting at level 42.
Sandygast is a Pokémon formed from sand. It is mostly a mound of whitish sand dotted with gray pebbles. A tunnel through its center acts as a mouth, and a small depression above that has two pebbles for eyes. A red shovel with a white handle is stuck blade first into the top of its head. On either side of its main body is a smaller mound reminiscent of a stubby arm.
Sandygast is born from grudges that seep into the sand, such as from Pokémon that suffer defeat in battle. It can suck the life force of people or Pokémon through its mouth. Apparently, in the Alola region, sticking a hand into Sandygast`s mouth is a way of proving one`s courage. A person who grabs Sandygast`s shovel falls under its control. It uses this power to make children add sand to its body so it can become bigger. A Sandygast that loses its shovel may replace it with something like a branch or a flag, but it is said to keep searching for its lost shovel.</description>

<description>Palossand is a dual-type Ghost/Ground Pokémon.
It evolves from Sandygast starting at level 42.
Palossand is a Pokémon resembling a yellowish sand castle with gray pebbles along the base. It has a square main castle for its body, two round towers for arms, and the top of another round tower with a conical point rising up from the body. A tunnel through the center of the main body creates a mouth. There is a line of five alternating blue and pink seashells over the top of its mouth. The central tower has six windows: three in the front, one on each side, and one in the back. The two outermost windows in front of the central tower have tiny pebbles in them and appear to act as eyes. The two side towers have crenellations along the top with a ring of windows underneath. Palossand`s main body has crenellations around the central tower. A ring of alternating pink and blue seashells surrounds the central tower just below the point. In the peak of its tower is a red shovel stuck handle-first into the top.
Palossand controls adults to make them build it a sand castle, which provides it a disguise and defense. However, Palossand is able to replenish any sand it loses on its own. The shovel on its head rotates when Palossand searches for prey and is believed to function as radar. It enjoys the life force of Pokémon. By creating a sandy vortex, it will capture small Pokémon and absorb their life force. Traces of its victims` ill will are left where Palossand passes, and this is said to be the genesis of new Sandygast.</description>

<description>Pyukumuku is a Water-type Pokémon.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
Pyukumuku is a marine Pokémon with an ovoid, black body. Its face has two beady, pink eyes and a white mouth shaped roughly like a star or Daimonji. This Pokémon is capable of spitting its organs out through its mouth. The white organs typically take the shape of a fist or stay in the same shape as its mouth. Two lines of three pink spikes run down each side of its back. The middle spike of each line is about twice as long as the others are. A fluffy white puff forms its tail.
Pyukumuku tends to find a spot it likes and stay there, even returning to the same spot if moved. Once all the food in its favorite spot has been consumed, it will continue to stay there to the point of starvation. Its body is coated with a viscous fluid that allows it to stay on land for a week without drying out. If stepped on, it will expel its fist-like organs and particularly hates having its mouth or spikes touched. Tourists dislike Pyukumuku due to its appearance and lifestyle and can easily step on buried Pyukumuku. This creates a need for part time jobs on beaches chucking this Pokémon back into the sea. However, people in Alola have already taken to throwing the Pokémon back to the sea where it can find food when thin. The fluid that coats its body is beneficial to people as a moisturizer.</description>

<description>Togedemaru is a dual-type Electric/Steel Pokémon.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
Togedemaru is a spherical, rodent-like Pokémon. Most of its front is white, while its back is primarily gray. It has black eyes, a short pointed snout with a black nose, and a circular, yellow marking on each cheek. Scattered across its back are yellow and brown triangular markings, which this Pokémon is able to extend straight up when attacking. There is a tail-like needle on the back of its head. The needle is gray with a yellow tip and is shaped like a lightning both. Additionally, it has stubby arms and legs.
Togedemaru uses the needle on top of its head to attract and gather electricity. Groups can be seen gathered with their needles standing upright, waiting to be struck by lightning on stormy days. Some Trainers use its ability to absorb electricity as strategy in battle. The opponent is coaxed into unleashing an Electric-type attack, and then has that power turned against it. Togedemaru can also curl into a ball to make its fur stand up in a ball of prickles.</description>

<description>Mimikyu is a dual-type Ghost/Fairy Pokémon.
While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, it changes appearance when hit by an attack.
Mimikyu is a small Pokémon whose body is almost entirely hidden under a veil. Its beady black eyes are visible through holes in the body of its disguise, and the fringe of an amorphous foot or lower body appears to be visible under the hem of its veil. Occasionally, it will also extend a black appendage from under its veil. The veil itself resembles a Pikachu. The cloth is yellow with black tipped ears. The Pikachu face appears to be drawn with crayons, consisting of black eyes, red cheeks, and a squiggly black mouth. Mimikyu also carries a small stick resembling a lightning bolt to create a tail for its costume.
Mimikyu is always covered by its disguise. Since this Pokémon is weakened by sunlight, it is rumored that the veil is used for protection. It is believed that seeing its true form will cause a mysterious illness. Mimikyu`s disguise is modelled after Pikachu because of the popularity of Pikachu-styled merchandise. This lonely Pokémon thought that this disguise would allow it to make friends with people.</description>

<description>Bruxish is a dual-type Water/Psychic Pokémon.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
Bruxish is a fish-like Pokémon covered in colorful scales and fins. The front of its body is light blue with large, dark purple lips. Its mouth is full of sharp teeth. The upper half of its body is mostly light purple, while the lower half is mostly yellow. The purple portion of its body is dotted with light blue spots. The yellow underside extends up around its eyes, which are light purple with light blue pupils. Its eyelids are dark purple with long, light blue eyelashes. Its fins are all dark purple, light blue, or a combination of the two colors: the pectoral fins are mostly dark purple with a short line blue line along the bottom, the dorsal fin is light blue, the ventral fin is dark purple, and the tail fin is dark purple with a light blue, heart-shaped marking in the middle. On top of its head is an protuberance with a dark purple bulb at the tip. The bulb is able to open like a flower, which reveals a light blue orb in the center.
This Pokémon buries itself on the seafloor, leaving only the growth on its head exposed. By emitting a low level of psychic power, it serves as radar to detect prey. Additionally, the protuberance can emit a strong psychic power. Opponents bathed in this power are stricken with terrible headaches and fall unconscious. When emitting this power, Bruxish grinds its teeth. This sound is enough to send nearby Pokémon fleeing immediately. In the Alola region, lifeguards allow this Pokémon to remain in their area to prevent other, dangerous Water types from gathering.</description>

<description>Dhelmise is a dual-type Ghost/Grass Pokémon.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
Dhelmise is a Pokémon made up of an anchor and ship`s wheel, held together by a mass of green seaweed. The anchor is a rusty brown color and mottled with blackish spots. The seaweed, which is Dhelmise`s true body, partially envelops the thick, curved bottom of the anchor in a zigzag fashion, leaving empty spaces that look like sharp teeth. The seaweed continues upward to cover the anchor`s entire thin shank, as well as what appears to be a round, nose-like hub on the top. The ship`s wheel, colored lavender with yellow details, is affixed to the back of this hub by its center and able to rotate freely. The noticeably damaged wheel features six spokes and four yellow handles, as well as two lavender stubs where the other handles should be. A simple compass, resembling an eye, is set into a disc-shaped component on one side of the wheel; mirroring this is an identical disc on the opposite side, though nothing is set into it.</description>

<description>Tapu Koko is a dual-type Electric/Fairy Pokémon.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
It is the guardian deity of Melemele Island.
Tapu Koko`s head and torso are black with white markings on its chest, just above its eyes, and on top of its head. Extending from the top of its head is a large, orange plume with bristles along the back. There is a yellow marking covering the top bristle and half of the bristle below it. The bottom of this crest goes all the way to its neck, where it divides its face in half and creates a beak-like nose. It has small, blue eyes with yellow markings behind them. The lower half of its body is orange with four pointed projections: one short spine on the front and two short spines in the back, with one longer spine between them. These spines resemble a bird`s tail feathers. Its thin arms have round, yellow structures encircling its shoulders. On each arm is a shell that appears to be half of a bird mask, and its hands end in two large claws to create a beak for the mask.
The mask itself is mostly yellow with black, orange, and white markings. There are three white triangular markings with black edges on the top of each half of the mask, which create diamond-shapes when the mask is closed. The `eyes` consist of a white diamond connected to a slightly larger orange diamond, which is inside a larger yellow diamond. Each of these shapes is edged in black. On each half of its beak is an orange triangle with a white rim. There are wing-shaped structures on each side, toward the back. Tapu Koko is able to pull the mask together and hide its upper body inside, creating the impression of a stylized rooster.
This Pokémon is called the guardian deity of Melemele Island. It`s known for protecting its home, but it is fickle and will not necessarily help people in need. However, it is very curious, and may come to play or battle with people or Pokémon that interest it. It is able to store electricity by closing itself inside the shells on its arms. It has an explosive temper, but it instantly forgets what enraged it in the first place.
In the anime
Tapu Koko is the guardian deity of Melemele Island. It watched Ash a couple times during his first day in Alola. After the battle with Skull Gang, he spotted it but no one else did. Later that night, it appeared again and Ash followed it. Tapu Koko presented Ash with a Z-Ring which he accepted.
Kapu-Kokeko is very fickle and even though it is called a guardian deity, it does not always help out the people of Melemele Island, but sometimes pulls pranks or inflicts punishments. Additionally, on rare occasions, it reportedly also gives mysterious gifts to humans it takes a liking to like the Z-Ring given to Ash.
The next day, it appeared at the Pokémon School and took Ash`s hat. He quickly followed it into the forest where Tapu Koko challenged Ash to a battle. Tapu Koko is a Pokémon that is positively brimming with curiosity and ever since the olden days, there have been instances of it challenging islanders to Pokémon battles or to Alolan sumo wrestling matches. Pikachu battled it and difference in power between the two was initially too big. Tapu Koko then came and activated the Z-Ring and the Electric-Z on Ash`s arm but he didn`t have the slightest clue what he was supposed to do. He managed to fire off Sparking Gigavolt which Tapu Koko was able to defend and then fled the battle.</description>

<description>Tapu Lele is a dual-type Psychic/Fairy Pokémon.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
It is the guardian deity of Akala Island.
Tapu Lele has a black torso and pink curly hair. Its eyes are blue with pink lines at the middle of the iris. Its arms are thin, and its digitless hands are separated by thick pink "bracelets". Its shell has markings similar to a face and have small, butterfly-like wings at the back. The top is cone-shaped and resembles a hat of some sort. When closed, the shell resembles a bug with a curled mouth at the bottom.
The guardian of Akala Island is known to scatter glowing scales, which affect others by stimulating and healing their bodies; however, these scales are also dangerous if too many are touched at once. For this, some consider it to be cruel for the way it destroys others as it scatters its scales for its own amusement. An old legend says that Tapu Lele ended a war between Alola`s islands by healing the tired warriors with its scales, but rumors point to a more disturbing truth behind this story.</description>

<description>Nihilego is a dual-type Rock/Poison Pokémon.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
It is one of the Ultra Beasts and is known by code name UB-01 Symbiont.
Nihilego is an Ultra Beast which resembles a jellyfish. It is mostly white and has tentacles shaped like the hair, dress, and legs of a girl. On top of its head is an object that looks like a sun hat. This "hat" has six pointed stars around the crown, and the brim has a blue edge. The ends of the "hair" fly out, resembling arms, and the outer tentacles of the "dress" have two bubbles inside.
Nihilego is a parasitic organism, capable of injecting a neurotoxin that manipulates the thoughts and actions of the host. This neurotoxin stimulates intense feelings of excitement while causing a loss of inhibitions, which acts to forcibly bring out any latent potential within the host at the expense of its mental stability. At the same time, it seems to subvert its host`s personality and instincts in a manner that benefits Nihilego directly at the expense of the host and others. Its exact levels of intelligence are unknown, but according to the Aether Foundation`s research it seems to act mainly on a self-preservation instinct. It has been observed behaving like a young girl, though the exact reasons for this are uncertain.
As seen with Lusamine in Pokémon Sun and Moon, Nihilego is capable of physically possessing its hosts in addition to manipulating their minds. In this "merged" state, the "hat" loses its stars, developing several iridescent spots across its surface; the host`s body is visible within the "hat", with their legs dangling beneath it. Its eight tentacles become long and flattened in appearance, and what appear to be eyeballs with colored diamond-shaped "pupils" cover their surface, along with smaller multi-colored dots. Four of the tentacles are connected to the "hat" via frilly white structures; these tentacles have four spines protruding from them that can be used similarly to hands. The remaining four tentacles each terminate in a single smaller spine.</description>

<description>Solgaleo is a dual-type Psychic/Steel Legendary Pokémon.
It evolves from Cosmoem when leveled up in Pokémon Sun starting at level 53. It is one of Cosmog`s final forms, the other being Lunala.
Solgaleo takes a special form called the Radiant Sun phase when it uses Sunsteel Strike.
Along with Lunala, it was initially revealed in May 2016, but officially revealed on June 2, 2016.
Solgaleo is the game mascot of Pokémon Sun, appearing on the boxart.
Solgaleo is a large, white Pokémon resembling a white lion. It has a blunt muzzle with a blue-gray nose and pale blue eyes. The top half of its face is a deep blue area that shows a constantly changing starscape. Four yellow spikes frame Solgaleo`s head like a crown and two more pairs of spikes adorn either side of its lower jaw, and each spike separates large tufts of Solgaleo`s mane. Solid ridges - red nearest Solgaleo`s head and yellow farther away - poke out of each tuft along the middle, except on the tufts on its cheeks and chin, with the topmost part wrapping around the tip of the tuft. Overall, its mane creates the impression of a stylized sun. Around each leg is a dark orange band, and there is a black spot on each foot. It has three black toes on each foot with long yellow claws. At the tip of its tail is a large black spot with a thin yellow rim.
When Solgaleo enters its Radiant Sun phase, a light blue symbol appears on its forehead and the starscape turns to streaks of light. The fur on its body glows a pale yellow and all other parts of its body except its nose turn bright yellow.
Known as the "beast that devours the sun," Solgaleo has long been honored as an emissary of the sun. Its body is capable of holding a vast amount of energy and glows when active. Solgaleo can create Ultra Wormholes to travel to and from Ultra Space. Solgaleo along with its counterpart Lunala can create Cosmog.
Solgaleo is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Sunsteel Strike.</description>

<description>Lunala is a dual-type Psychic/Ghost Legendary Pokémon.
It evolves from Cosmoem when leveled up in Pokémon Moon starting at level 53. It is one of Cosmog`s final forms, the other being Solgaleo.
Lunala takes a special form called the Full Moon phase when it uses Moongeist Beam.
Along with Solgaleo, it was initially revealed in May 2016, but officially revealed on June 2, 2016.
Lunala is the game mascot of Pokémon Moon, appearing on the boxart.
Lunala is a large Pokémon resembling a skeletal, legless bat. It has a short snout, dark pink eyes, and a deep blue area on its upper head that shows a constantly changing starscape. A rigid, raised hood wraps around its head in a crescent shape and drapes around its neck as well. The outside of the hood is yellow, while the inner part that curves around Lunala`s head is a pattern of deep blue and white streaks. Its torso resembles a ribcage with a slightly curved spike on each shoulder and three spikes extending from the bottom toward its tail. Its massive wings resemble a bat`s wings with the skeleton exposed, except that Lunala`s wings have a total of seven "finger bones": four running through each wing, one running along the edge to the outermost tip, and two pointing upwards that may act as claws that are more functional. The four "bones" through Lunala`s wings are only visible in segments. The skin of Lunala`s wings is an iridescent deep blue, and a blue light source appears to glow from behind its ribcage. A large, pale yellow crescent connects the outermost tip of each wing to the next two inner tips, and the remaining two innermost tips are adorned by yellow, four-pointed stars. The bottom of Lunala`s tail is also lined by a yellow crescent, with a ridge running up the middle of the tail towards the ribcage.
When Lunala enters its Full Moon phase, a light red symbol of an eye appears on its forehead and the starscape turns to streaks of light. The skin of its wings glows a bright, light blue. It spreads its wings wide so that the yellow parts on each wing are arranged in a circle with the outermost point of the four-pointed stars disappearing in the transformation.
Known as the "beast that calls the moon," Lunala has long been honored as an emissary of the moon. This Pokémon constantly absorbs light to convert into energy. When it spreads its wings to absorb light and glitters, it resembles a beautiful night sky. Lunala can create Ultra Wormholes to travel to and from Ultra Space. Lunala and its counterpart, Solgaleo, can create Cosmog.
Lunala is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Moongeist Beam.</description>

<description>Team Skull is the villainous team in the Alola region.
Team Skull appears in Sun and Moon. As revealed by some of their members, Team Skull is composed of misfits who failed the Island challenge. They steal Pokémon from people, but unlike previous villainous teams, they do not have a specific goal other than to cause trouble.
Team Skull originated from a group that coalesced around one of Alola`s kahunas. This group provoked the wrath of the four island deities and was struck down. The survivors became the first members of Team Skull. At some point, Team Skull took over Po Town on Ula`ula Island, driving away the original residents.
At some point, Lusamine became the secret benefactor of Team Skull, and they, in turn, started to carry out her orders.
After Guzma is rescued from Ultra Space by the player, he disbands Team Skull and its members go their separate ways. Guzma returns to his parents` house on Melemele Island, while Plumeria takes up residence in a camper on Route 13 and later challenges the Alola Pokémon League. One Grunt becomes an apprentice chef under Mallow in Konikoni City, while two others in the Po Town Pokémon Center offer a Skull Tank for sale in order for them to make enough money to leave. Others are taken by Hala to train in Iki Town, deciding to become a rescue team and dubbing themselves "Team Reskull".
Team Skull makes their first appearance in Alola to New Adventure!, where three Team Skull Grunts were seen harassing Kiawe in front of the Pokémon School. Though the three Grunts outnumbered Kiawe and Ash, they emerged victorious though the combined efforts of Ash`s Pikachu and Kiawe`s Turtonator. More Grunts appeared in a flashback in SM005, where they were harassing a Popplio on the beach until Lana intervened by freezing them solid with her Ride Pokémon, Lapras.</description>

<description>Ash`s Rockruff initially resided at Professor Kukui`s home on Melemele Island. It became friends with Ash and Pikachu when it greeted them by nuzzling the rocks on its neck against them. It also enjoys eating Alola Plate, the traditional home cuisine in the Alola region.
At night, it would leave the professors home to go train at Scratchmark Hill with other Pokémon. Ash and the Professor stayed out of sight as they wanted to see where Rockruff was going when they were away from the home. After training with Rockruff for the dojo battle, Professor Kukui suggested that Ash get Rockruff because he was the one that it trusts the most because he helped it master Rock Throw and win the battle against Magmar. Ash took out his Poké Ball and caught Rockruff.
Ash`s Lycanroc (Dusk Form) is the evolved form of Ash`s Rockruff. It evolved on Akala Island at the Ruins of Life at dusk. A rare natural phenomenon that occurs at sunset and sunrise called a Green Flash occurred and triggered the evolving process. It evolved into a surprise form of Lugarugan that aren`t in any books or zukan.</description>

He received the dex from Professor Kukui to support him in his travels.
It`s known as the Rotom Pokédex because unlike a normal electronic dex, it`s inhabited by Rotom, a Pokémon with the power to reside in various electronic appliances. The Rotom Pokédex sparkles with its own personality and shows the current location and the next destination. The Rotom Zukan has been programmed to communicate with humans and comes with many languages built in. It also gives advice on where to go next, based on the conversations he had with others.</description>

<description>While searching in the forest to get Pokémon, Rocket Gang first encountered Mimikyu. Moments later Ash and his classmates arrived who were also looking for Pokémon to catch. Both groups attempted to get Mimikyu.
Not much is known about this Pokémon beyond the fact that it wears an old rag that looks just like a Pikachu and its actual appearance is unknown. It is said that scholars who tried seeing what was underneath died from the shock. Meowth decided to look under the Pikachu-shaped piece of cloth Jessie`s Mimikyu was wearing and he ended up going into some kind of delusional state that his consciousness suddenly faded and when he came to, he was walking through a dark tunnel. He was then joined by a group of super cute Pokémon but then the surroundings suddenly turned really creepy and he fell into a bottomless pit. Jessie and James threw water on Meowth before he died.
Jessie`s Mimikyu absolutely hates Pikachu. Mimikkyu doesn`t take on the appearance of a Pikachu because it likes it and it actually the appearance of Pikachu is what Mimikkyu hates the most in the entire world. Since it hates Pikachu, Mimikkyu decided to fight alongside Rocket Gang.</description>

<description>Ash`s Rowlet was obtained in the forest near the Pokémon School on Melemele Island. It is an easygoing glutton that still exhibits incredible amounts of power when fighting for its friends. It enjoys roosting in Ash`s backpack and is often seen there while traveling.
It hatched from an egg with a group of Pikipek and despite the Pokémon type difference, it became a well liked family member of the nest which also included a Trumbeak and a Toucannon. It would often go on food scavenges with the flock at a certain time of the year. It had mistaken a wind chime for a berry and it had to go out again to find food but the second time it went out it mistook Mallow`s Bounsweet for food as well. Ash though took pity on it and gave it some food including a watermelon which Rowlet took back to the nest and was congratulated for bringing. Ash though wanted to catch the Rowlet, so he followed it back to the nest. When Ash decided that it should stay with its family in the nest instead of trying to catch it, Toucannon nudged Rowlet out, telling it to go with Ash. Moments later, it let itself be caught by the Poké Ball.</description>

Only those who pass the earlier trials they`re given by Hala can attempt his Grand Trial. It`s also his duty to solve the problems that occur on Melemele Island.
Ash wanted to get Z-Crystals and Professor Kukui suggested to him that he go on the Island Pilgrimage and pass the Grand Trials issued by the Island King Hala. They met him on the road cleaning up the lumber that was blocking it. Hala noticed that Ash was wearing a Z-Ring that he made. One day, he noticed that one of the Rings had disappeared and he intuitively knew that it was Tapu Koko`s doing. Hala then gave him the task of figuring out how to solve the disturbance caused by wild Ratta and Koratta. Under the guidance of King Hala, Ash and his Pokémon challenged and passed their first trial by getting the Yungoos and the Dekagoos to help out.</description>

It did not undergo ordinary, run-of-the-mill training as Hala works with all his Pokémon to unlock their potential.
During the Grand Trial battle against Ash`s Rowlet, Crabrawler was at a disadvantage due to the types. Rowlet was able to use the smokescreen from Leafage to surprise Crabrawler and Peck it from behind to have a successful counterattack to all the previous attacks. That was the turning point in the match as Ash`s Rowlet won the match but fell asleep while flying as it got too tired from battling.</description>

<description>Both the English and Japanese closed captions for SM24 do not give a name for her and just list her as Lana`s Mother. She is the mother of Sarah, Harper and Lana and lives with them in the Alola Region on Melemele Island.
Parents and Guardians were invited to the Pokémon School for Visitation Day. Lana`s Mother made her first brief appearance catching her kids who were running around the school and tried to calm them down by telling them they could go to the Pokémon School when they were older.
Despite her brief appearance in the episode, Lana`s Mother has spawned a huge popularity in the Pokémon Fanart community as well as in the hentai doujinshi market due to her scene in SM24 which featured her children rubbing up against her large breasts as she tried to wrangle them up.</description>

After witnessing that battle, Jessie noted that since they treat evil and justice as the same thing, that Lugarugan which is creepy and cool would be a perfect match for them. Musashi kept getting its name wrong though and kept calling it Luganga. Meowth said that Lugarugan was filled with extreme bloodthirst.</description>

At the request of Samson Oak and Professor Kukui, he was a special coach one day at the Pokémon School where he used to attend as a student. He was told there were some students at the school who were interested in Pokébase and he had a spare moment one day to teach them about the game. He played a couple rounds with them and was instrumental in beating Team Rocket in the second match.
Jessie was a very sensible hunk and wanted his autograph. She didn`t know anything about Pokébase but was just infatuated with his good looks. Oluolu agreed to give her an autograph if they beat the Pokémon School Pokébase. In the end, they lost that match but Oluolu gave her an autograph as a thank you for a nice game.</description>

During the match verses Team Rocket, the strategy of Team Rocket was to always hit the ball towards Oluolu`s Snorlax because it was always sleeping even during the game and it appeared to be very slow. That strategy seemed to work as Team Rocket scored a lot of runs during the game and the ball would bounce off of Snorlax`s stomach and onto the field. In the bottom of the 9th, the ball hit his bat and it used the Z-Move Pulverizing Pancake to quickly run around the bases and flatten Wobbuffet to score the game winning run at home plate.</description>

<description>The Master Fisherman of Akala Island has been a fisherman for 40 years or maybe even 99 years. His story kept changing every time he told it. Apparently, those that want to fish for the lunker known as the Lord of the Lake in a lake near Brooklet Hill need his permission to battle it. He has "scars" that are badges of honor that he received in mortal combat with the Lord of the Lake though they flaked off.
The master fisherman required that people asserted themselves if they are qualified fishermen to try to battle the Lord of the Lake and first catch a Hinbass as proof of their skills. Lana had caught a Hinbass before he could finish explaining the requirement.
He had "apparently" been a master fisherman for 99 years and in all those years he had never seen such an amazing battle before between Lana and what ended up being a School Form Wishiwashi.</description>

<description>Kiawe first encountered Marowak when it stole the Wela Crown during the Wela Fire Festival. It is said that when it is placed on a Pokémon`s head, it can become valiant and strong like Wela Volcano itself. Kiawe and Turtonator took up the task of retrieving the crown. Kiawe`s Turtonator was instrumental in battling Marowak but it lost the first match against because they were in a rush to get the crown back and Kiawe wasn`t paying proper attention to their opponent. He didn`t read Marowak`s actions and he just thought they could win as long as they unleashed a Z-Move but battling is all about watching their opponent closely and understanding them.
After a training session with Ash and Pikachu, they challenged Marowak and were prepared this time. Shell Smash was a risky move to use in the battle but was used as a setup move in combination with Inferno Overdrive to knock out Marowak and win the rematch battle. They were able to return the Wela Crown after Marowak gave it up.
Kiawe`s Marowak took the crown and wore it because it wanted to grow stronger. The rematch battle made Kiawe realize that and also that its heart burns with passion, just like his does. Marowak is kind of obnoxious but it wanted to become a partner with Kiawe and it was caught willingly after the rematch battle.</description>

The Mini-Noses` formation attack couldn`t be underestimated because the Magnet Bomb could deal heavy damage even if only one of them hit. In a Double Battle, the Mini-Noses` made the match a five against two which put Ash at an overwhelming disadvantage.
Probopass provided mostly support for Olivia`s Lycanroc which did most of the attacks during the battle. It got knocked out by Ash`s Rowlet using the Grass-type Z-Crystal and attacking with the Z-Move Bloom Doom.</description>

It used its the fan-like object consisting of layers of leaves bound together with its own fur to fight against them and managed to rescue Mallow`s Steenee.</description>

<description>Wicke is an member of the Aether Foundation where she is in charge of their Pokémon conservation efforts. She helped measured abnormally high amounts of Ultra Aura in the vicinity of the Altar of the Sunne at Poni Island the night that Ash had his Starcloud (Cosmog) dream. When she came to meet Ash and Starcloud (Cosmog), she told them that they had a wide variety of Pokémon conservation facilities and that Ash could safely entrust the Cosmog to them but he explained that he`d made a promise to look after the Cosmog.</description>

<description>Pikarla is a Pokémon Trainer who works in the Pikachu Valley with a bunch of Pikachu. She loves Pikachu`s and dresses up like one with a tail and headband ears. She gave Ash and his friends a set each to wear when they visited the valley. All the Pikachu in the Valley are her`s and she gets Pikachu all day long. Even though she has a lot of them already, she`s nowhere near done getting more Pikachu`s.
For all the guests to the valley, Pikarla has three rules they must follow while they are there:
Number one: Become a Pikachu in spirit!
Number two: Love all Pikachu!
Number three: Pikaspeak: Whenever you say something, add a "Pika" at the end!
Those who follow these rules can become residents of the Pikachu Valley, or "Pikafriends".
She has a Z-Ring which she uses with her Pikachu (Boss) but it is normally hidden behind her wrist scrunchie.</description>

<description>Pikachu went up to befriend all of Pikarla`s Pikachu in the valley but they put their guard up and it wasn`t till Kurin, a bold female Pikachu approached Pikachu. She and the rest of Pikarla`s Pikachu misinterpreted Ash`s Pikachu initial greeting as flirting and left it.
It can be easily recognized, as she has very curly bangs, so Pikarla called it Curly-chan because of that. It later came back and touched tails with Ash`s Pikachu to which Hoshi and Pikarla believed that Ash`s Pikachu gave her butterflies because it was now glossy and more appealing to her.
When Rocket Gang attacked, it was captured by them but Pikarla`s Pikachu (Boss) used the Z-move Catastropika to on them and Jessie`s Mimikyu to send the Rocket`s flying while releasing all the Pikachu at the same time. After being rescued by Pikarla`s Pikachu (Boss), she fell in love with him.
This Pikachu is voiced by Nicole Fujita who was voice acting for the very first time.</description>

<description>Pikarla`s Pikachu (Boss) is an alternately colored Pikachu that lives in the Pikachu Valley in the Alola Region. It has always had a crush on Pikarla`s Pikachu (Curly) and when it saw that Ash`s Pikachu was becoming friendly with Pikarla`s Pikachu (Curly), it got jealous. It`s also possible that it didn`t approve of an outsider.
It hit Ash`s Pikachu with electric shocks signalizing a duel which is one of the rules in the valley. Humans are not allowed to interfere in the battle and the first Pikachu to bite the other`s tail wins. Pikachu was a lot more experienced in battling and quickly won the duel with an Electroweb.
When Rocket Gang attacked, Pikarla`s Pikachu (Curly) was captured by them but Pikarla`s Pikachu (Boss) used the Z-move Catastropika to on them and Jessie`s Mimikyu to send the Rocket`s flying while releasing all the Pikachu at the same time.
