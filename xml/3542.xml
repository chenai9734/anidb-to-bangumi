<description>In the year 1755, three people were born in three different countries of Europe who were later brought together by a twist of fate: http://anidb.net/ch51684 [Hans Axel von Fersen], the eldest son of a Swedish nobleman; http://anidb.net/ch51681 [Oscar Francois de Jarjayes], a daughter of French General de Jarjayes; and http://anidb.net/ch51683 [Marie Antoinette], an Austrian princess who became the tragic queen of France. In the year 1773, Antoinette and Oscar went to Paris incognito in order to visit the masquerade at the Opera, and there they met Fersen in a fateful encounter.

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>elements</name>
<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>past</name>
<description>Anime that takes place in the past or clearly seems to take place in the past in case of an alternative universe. This category should almost always go together with one of its sub-categories, because the past can either be a depiction of a historical event(s) or not, in which case it would be alternative past.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Oscar Francois de Jarjayes was born the last of five daughters to the Commander of the Royal Guards, http://anidb.net/ch67413 [General François Augustin Regnier de Jarjayes]. She is raised by her father as if she were a boy in order to take his place and command the Royal Guards serving at the Court after he retires.
At the age of fourteen, as soon as her training in the basic military skills is complete, Oscar is given the task to protect the Dauphine http://anidb.net/ch51683 [Marie Antoinette] when she arrives at the French Court. Despite being raised as if she were a boy and dressing in males` clothes, Oscar is open about being female. Even as she embraces her femininity, she uses her male position to gain freedoms that she could never have as a lady of the court.</description>
