<description>* Based on the Baka Ja Katenai no yo (バカじゃ勝てないのよ) story that was featured in the manga`s fifth volume.
The Seirin players gather in the gym, bringing their past test results along. In the gym, http://anidb.net/ch39710 [Riko] and http://anidb.net/ch39711 [Izuki] explain that even though the actual results of the upcoming review tests don`t matter, they are used for a ranking, with the bottom 100 having to take a remedial class the next Saturday, coincidentally the same day when the final league of the Inter-High commences. Therefore, all the players must make sure to have good grades, or they won`t be able to play. After looking into the results, with http://anidb.net/ch39488 [Kuroko]`s ordinariness expressing itself in his grades too, the only problem that they find is http://anidb.net/ch39487 [Kagami]`s terrible grades. They decide to specially tutor Kagami at Riko`s house.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<description>What the anime is based on! This is given as the original work credit in the OP. Mostly of academic interest, but a useful bit of info, hinting at the possible depth of story.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kagami is a serious guy who grew up in America till 13. He hates how Japanese students plays basketball but decides to challenge "Kiseki no Sedai" since he believes that "You cant live a life without challenging strong opponents".
He starts to hate kuroko since he plays extremely badly, and calls him a "bluff guy". but he changes his mind after seeing his impact in game.
He turns on and tries harder when people make fun out of him and call him weak and often laughs when he looses to a strong person.
even though he and Kuroko get along, he often starts a fight with him since Kuroko`s calm attitude gets on his nerves.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kuroko (or Kurokochi as Kise calls him) is a short stiff guy who plays basketball worse than any amateur. But, he has one and only talent that makes him invincible: he has a great ability in misdirection and passing the ball, also due to his extremely small size and build (comparing to other players), he often gets ignored and therefore he can "hide" himself behind other regulars and distract them by ball movement so no one will notice he is there. the benefits of his invisible style, (as taiga calls it) makes him able to steal balls from players without them noticing he is around. He is known as the Invisible Phantom sixth of the famous group of middle schoolers, "Kiseki no Sedai".
His Weak point is that he looses his effectiveness after 40 minutes and other players will get used to his presence.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Shintarou was Kiseki no Sedai`s best shooter, none of his teammates remember him to miss a shoot.
He has a high keen to horoscopes and listens to oha saha horoscope every day and carries the lucky item they recommend. He believes that if you try hard, your fate will follow.
He shows a huge attention to his fingers and always polishes and adjusts his nails and keeps them bandaged.
Despite saying he dislikes Kuroko, he actually cares so deep about him (as his friend says) and always mentions that he highly respects Kuroko`s style of playing.
It seems that he envies Kagami for being Kuroko`s new "light".</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kise is a stunningly famous guy who was among Kiseki no Sedai. he has a great ability in copying the movement styles of his opponent. He works as a model for magazines due to his height and good looking face. unlike his manly looks, he has a childish manner comparing to his friends in the same age.
Kise started basketball in the second year of middle school and is less experienced comparing to other players from Kiseki and claims to be the worst one among them. He shows high respect among Kuroko and feels sorry for him to be among the weak team of Teiko high.
He believes that Basketball is the game of Size, but with all these, he tries to convince Kuroko to join their team.
His Weak point is that he cant copy Kuroko`s game style and also is unable to do much when he cant see the movements of his opponent</description>
