<description>The Earth lies darkened and deserted. Despite the best efforts of http://anidb.net/ch12488 [Hikaru], the evil-filled castle of Cephiro has taken over the world and stands in the centre of a lifeless Tokyo. Before the ice-witch http://anidb.net/ch12499 [Alcyone] can take her revenge on Hikaru though, she is rescued by http://anidb.net/ch12493 [Lantis], a young man who seals her into a magical maze where she is challenged to prove her powers while her friends are hunted down by Cephiro`s warlocks.
Fleeing through the silent city, http://anidb.net/ch12487 [Umi] and http://anidb.net/ch12486 [Fuu] must seek out the sleeping Mashin — godlike creatures that will fuse with them to form giant warriors of awesome destructive power. But the Magic Knights are afraid, untrained and alone... will even the Mashin be enough to save them from the evil acts of Cephiro?</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<tag id="2607" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2009-04-29">
<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>When a job needs to get done you need the appropriate clothing on the appropriate persons. That calls for preferably scantily clad young ladies. Spies will dress in sexy outfits, even when the mission explicitly calls for them to not to be noticed. Female warriors will charge into battle wearing armour that does not protect the vital organs. Bridge officers on a military starship will be issued go-go boots with their uniforms. Examples are the women in VanDread, AIKa or the most famous incarnation of that tag, the Strike Witches and their precursor the Sky Girls.</description>

<description>Asia is Earth`s largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometers, about 30% of Earth`s total land area and 8.7% of the Earth`s total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

<name>parallel world</name>
<description>A parallel world, parallel universe, or alternative reality is a self-contained separate reality coexisting with our own. Because "alternative reality" sometimes implies that the reality is a variant of our own, like for example a mirror world, we use the term "parallel world/universe" which is more general, without any connotations implying a relationship (or lack thereof) with our own world/universe (meaning a fictional world can just as well have an alternative reality, it doesn`t need to be our reality). To put it more simply, this category is to show if more than 1 world/universe/reality is present in the anime.
Multiple timelines of the same world/universe/reality are NOT considered parallel worlds. For example, in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate] the cast travels through multiple "World Lines", which are defined as parallel timelines of the same universe had various events occurred with differing outcomes.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<description>Hanami (花見, lit. "flower viewing") is the Japanese traditional custom of enjoying the beauty of flowers, "flower" in this case almost always meaning cherry blossoms or ume blossoms. 
From the end of March to early May, sakura bloom all over Japan, and around the first of February on the island of Okinawa. The blossom forecast (桜前線 sakurazensen, literally cherry blossom front) is announced each year by the weather bureau, and is watched carefully by those planning hanami as the blossoms only last a week or two. 
In modern-day Japan, hanami mostly consists of having an outdoor party beneath the sakura during daytime or at night. Hanami at night is called yozakura (夜桜, literally night sakura).

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Fuu is a very demure but very intelligent young girl (though this goes more for book-smarts than street-smarts) who hails from a prep school and is generally the voice of reason.
Always very polite and considerate, she frequently speaks formally, even to Hikaru and Umi, though she sometimes has her comic moments (occasional weird quips and her tendency to chat with Umi on off-topic matters). Still, she is a valuable friend and trusted ally.
Fuu adapts relatively easily to Cephiro, seeing it much like a role-playing game (a favorite pastime of hers). She is part of an archery club, so she shows skill with her initial weapon: a bow and arrow. But interestingly, Fuu`s Magic Sword turns out to be a huge broadsword that is taller than she is. Fortunately, its magic powers also make it light enough for her to wield.
Fuu is the second to revive her Guardian, and she has fallen in love with the mysterious swordsman Ferio.
She is the Magic Knight of Wind and her name translates to "Wind of the Phoenix Temple".</description>

She is quick-tempered and at first uncaring and selfish, though perhaps the best-suited for the task at hand, but is also the most reluctant. As Magic Knight Rayearth progresses, she starts to care for other people and better understand the Magic Knights` situation. Perhaps this is because she is a "privileged" girl.
Interestingly enough Umi is the first Magic Knight to revive her Guardian.
She is the Magic Knight of Water and her name translates to "Sea Dragon Blossom".</description>

<description>Hikaru is pretty much what you expect in an anime redhead: fire in her eyes, energetic and assertive almost to the point of aggressiveness. She`s a girl of action.
She`s also a girl of emotional extremes. She`s normally upbeat and happy all the time. Having a dog back home, she takes to the cute Mokona instantly. She is however vulnerable to bouts of deep depression, especially when something really shakes her to the core. She also looks a little young for her age and is a bit naive.
Hikaru is the most willing of the three (at first) to become a Magic Knight, and Hikaru`s magic sword is the most traditional, resembling a broadsword.
Her family runs a kendo dojo, so she`s the quickest to get into the swing of things.
Interestingly, though, she`s the last to revive her Guardian (Rayearth).
She is the Magic Knight of Fire and her name translates to "Light of the Lion Shrine".</description>

In the manga he is referred to as Guru Clef and is not turned to stone.
In the second series, he leads all of Cephiro until a new pillar can be found. He and all other magicians used their willpower to create a castle to hold the inhabitants of Cephiro. He almost lost his life when he used a strong spell to bring back all the Magic Knights from Lady Debonair and Innova.</description>

It is revealed that she was once a noblewoman of Cephiro, and had later used her power as the Pillar to prevent her younger brother Ferio from being punished for stealing something from her. He had forgotten she was his sister because, at his own request, she had used her magic to help him forget about her so he would not miss her or feel sorrow, and asked that she in turn forget him, so that she could focus her thoughts and prayers only on Cephiro.</description>

<name>Lantis</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Lantis is a powerful Kailu and the younger brother of High Priest Zagato. He makes his first appearance in episode 23 of the second season, his reasons for coming back to Cephiro after the destruction of the Pillar shrouded in mystery. In the beginning it is only revealed that Lantis is a traveler, having seen many worlds during his self-imposed exile from Cephiro, one of the most important, and last, being Autozam - one of the three invading countries. For this reason, he is regarded with suspicion by the people of Cephiro.
Brief flashbacks during the show, reveal to us that Lantis was Princess Emeraude`s Captain of the Guards before Lafarga. The time period is blurry, as Lantis himself tells Hikaru. With the added knowledge that in Cephiro those with strong hearts can live for extended periods of time, changing their appearances at leisure, his age can vary from several decades to several centuries. At the most 700 years, since Clef admits (at the beginning of the manga) that he himself is 745 years.
Lantis is a quiet and private man but undeniably strong, in heart, body and mind. Such is clearly hinted at by both Master Mage Clef (who believes that Lantis has enough power to equal that of his older brother Zagato and perhaps even surpass it) and Debonair (who makes no secret of the fact that his heart is `fearfully strong` and that she wants him for his power, going as far as to send Nova to get him for herself).
Lantis is a powerful mage - having learned from Clef, his former master - and wields a sword skillfully enough to be considered a talented swordsman. This makes him the only Magic Swordsman in all of Cephiro.
During the second season, he falls in love with Hikaru and she with him; together they face the possibility of imminent destruction of Cephiro - who still lacks a pillar and is slowly crumbling - and surpass the obstacles set out in front of them: Nova, Debonair and the three invading countries.
He shares a deep friendship with Eagle of Autozam - leader of one of the major three invading forces - and doesn`t wish to fight him for the sake of the pillar`s crown. It is later revealed that Lantis`s return to Cephiro was conditioned by his desire to stop the tragedy of Emeraude and Zagato from ever repeating again; his greatest wish is to destroy the Pillar system and he is willing to give his life to achieve his goal.</description>

<name>Primera</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Primera is a fairy who has acted as Lantis`s guardian ever since he saved her from a monster attack. She`s very jealous and possessive of Lantis and thus harbors a deep dislike for Hikaru. From the start, Mokona likes to tease Primera, causing her to greatly dislike Mokona.
When Hikaru and Lantis start to become friendly with each other, she pops up to stop them out of jealousy, but Mokona either chases her away or eats her and later spits her out. She can use low-level healing magic when necessary.
Primera makes an appearance in Tsubasa in the Hanshin Republic and is later mentioned in the country of Piffle, by Shogo Asagi. Rather than being tiny, she is the size of a normal human.</description>

<name>Zagato</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>When he is first introduced, he is seen as a terrible villain who has kidnapped the beloved Princess Emeraude, watching cruelly as Cephiro crumbles without its pillar. However, this image is far from the truth.
High Priest to Princess Emeraude and Clef`s right-hand man, Zagato fell deeply in love with the beautiful and kind Princess. Despite her best efforts to put Cephiro first and foremost, Princess Emeraude fell in love with Zagato as well. When Emeraude goes missing, Zagato came forth as having had kidnapped Princess Emeraude. In reality, Emeraude was so upset by her lack of will that she imprisoned herself in the water dungeon to avoid seeing Zagato. Zagato does not reveal this to the Magic Knights or Cephiro`s people, aiming to destroy the knights when they come after him.
The reason Zagato is this way is because of his deep love for Emeraude and equally deep hate for Cephiro`s Pillar System. The Pillar must devote every moment of their existence to praying for Cephiro and never seek happiness from anything except seeing the planet prosper. Zagato was tormented to see Emeraude chained down as such and even more so when she had to resist the love that had grown between them. He decides that instead of Emeraude returning as the Pillar and continuing to be a slave to Cephiro, he would rather have Cephiro cease to exist.
In the end of the first season, he is killed in battle by the Magic Knights in a final attempt to protect Emeraude; his last words tell her to "be free." His death caused Emeraude to become lost in her own grief and rage, causing her to be killed by the Magic Knights, who were only forced to.</description>

<name>Alcyone</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Alcyone is an ice sorceress who tutored under Clef and was brought up to attend to the Pillar.
However, she fell in love with the high priest, Zagato, and for this love became his servant, although the affection is entirely one-sided.
In the manga, she is killed after failing Zagato not once but twice. In the anime, she lives on until near the end of the second series; few after Zagato and Esmeraude`s deaths, she`s captured by the evil witch Debonair, who brainwashes her into becoming her slave.
Lantis captures Alcyone in battle, but she has lost her memories; when she recovers them, she reveals Debonair`s plans for Cephiro and Debonair`s location, but her former mistress kills her before she can finish.</description>

<name>Ascot</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Ascot is a Palu, a young child with the unusual ability to summon monsters, whom he considers to be his friends.
Although hideous, they have no ill will, but villagers still fear them. Thus, Ascot was driven away until Zagato offered to give him and his friends a home in exchange for serving under him.
In the anime, he destroys Presea`s house with his monsters, and essentially causes her death; later, he confronts the Knights again (their first encounter in the manga), but Umi slaps him for using his friends and causing them pain. This causes a change of heart in Ascot, and he then forsakes Zagato.
In the second series, he has used the power of his own will to make himself into an adult because of his love for Umi. Also, he still summons monsters but has learned other spells from Clef to avoid using his friends as living weapons.
In the anime he is able to tell Umi his feelings before she leaves to fight Tarta. Umi replies that she loves him as well, but just as much as everyone else in Cephiro, and that she didn`t have any romantic feelings for him. This saddens Ascot a bit, but he still tries to win her heart later on.</description>

<name>Eagle Vision</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Eagle Vision is a well-known and respected commander from Cephiro`s neighbouring country, Autozam, a technologically advanced world reliant on the mental energy of its citizens for its power.
It is clear right away that Eagle is an enigmatic and forceful tactician, and though a gentle and chivalrous gentleman, he is the leader of Autozam`s invasion of Cephiro. His father is the President of Autozam.
Eagle comes to Cephiro with hopes of duplicating the Pillar System back on his home world, and also wishes to actually become the Pillar for personal reasons. Eagle is in fact very sick and wasn`t even supposed to be alive by the time he made it to Cephiro. Eagle reveals to Hikaru that he wants to become the Pillar to spare Lantis` life and be in an eternal sleep with Cephiro.
In the end, Hikaru tells him it is unfair of him to leave all his loved ones behind and saves him, bringing him back to Cephiro and starting him on the road to restoring his health. In the anime, however, Eagle sacrifices himself in order to save the Magic Knights.</description>

<name>Mokona</name>
<gender>none/does not apply</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Mokona is a mischievous, nonsensical rabbit-like creature, with a striking similarity to a manju bun, with a red gem in his forehead above his eyes. From this gem he can produce a tent for the Magic Knights to sleep in, food, and other necessary supplies. Unlike the nearly identical Mokona Modoki/Soel from xxxHOLIC and Tsubasa Chronicle, he is unable to speak, and is limited to making `puu` sounds, however Fuu is somehow able to understand him.
This Mokona is quite distinct from Soel, even though they have nearly identical appearance. The dimension witch Yuuko hints that her Mokonas, Soel and Larg, were based on this original creature from Cephiro.
Mokona is named after Mokona, one of CLAMP`s artists.</description>
