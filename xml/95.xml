Together with her sword-swinging naive but kind-hearted sidekick, http://anidb.net/ch7616 [Gouri]; her hyper-enthusiastic protégée, http://anidb.net/ch7619 [Amelia]; and the overly-serious golem, http://anidb.net/ch7618 [Zelgadis]; there is nothing Lina cannot do!
Lina and company have decided to reverse the spell that turned Zelgadis into a golem. Unfortunately, the counter-spell is contained in a powerful spell book that Lina, Amelia and Zelgadis have to "acquire" from the less than charitable owners. But first, the gang`s got to beat a really nasty monster, defeat a gang of flexing, bodybuilding bandits, face Lina`s greatest fear and find a dragon to make dinner with.

<name>tsundere</name>
<description>Tsundere (ツンデレ) (pronounced /(t)sʌnˈdɪə(r)/ in English or /t͡sun.de.ɽe/ in Japanese) is a Japanese concept of a character archetype which describes a person with a conceited, irritable, and/or violent personality that suddenly becomes modest and loving when triggered by some sort of cause (such as being alone with someone). The inverse scenario, where a modest and loving person becomes conceited/irritable/violent, is also a tsundere.
The default state does not matter. The character can default to "tsuntsun" or "deredere"; the key concept is the fact that there`s a (generally very quick) flip from one mode to the other.
It can also describe a contradictory personality which is good-willed on the inside, but with a harsh attitude on the outside. Originally found in Japanese bishoujo games, the word is now part of the otaku moe phenomenon, reaching into other media such as anime, manga, novels, and even mass media.
Tsundere is a portmanteau of the two words tsuntsun (ツンツン), and deredere (デレデレ). Tsuntsun is defined as "aloof, morose, pointed", and deredere is defined as "exhausted, lovestruck". Tsunderekko (ツンデレっ娘) is a related noun, referring to a girl with a tsundere personality. Like nekomimi, tsundere is considered a moe-inspiring character trait. The concept has received increasing attention in Japan, with a tsundere cafe opened in Akihabara and tsundere-themed products released (like Tomy Co.`s portable television set), and the concept increasingly reflected in recent anime, from an extended discussion of the meaning of the concept and its origin on the internet in http://anidb.net/a4777 [Lucky Star]`s Lucky Channel segment to merchandise for http://anidb.net/a3651 [The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya] classifying the characters according to tsundere-ness. Another accepted definition of tsundere is a girl who has a combative attitude toward others but is also kind on the inside. She usually plays out as having an attitude toward the main character, usually a male, and often criticizing him in one way or another, but as the series progresses she eventually warms up to him and sometimes even falls in love with him.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>medium awareness</name>
<description>Medium awareness is the situational and generally temporary awareness characters in works of fiction have and display of the very fact that they are characters in works of fiction. For example, they may comment about the background music, quip about the script or narration, complain about the roles given to them by the writer or their lack of screen time, see the subtitles that appear on screen, inform the audience about the arrival of the commercial break, and even use medium effects as tools. The most common form of medium awareness is known as breaking the fourth wall, in which characters speak directly to the audience, either to it as a whole or to specific members of it. The "fourth wall" is the imaginary "wall" at the front of the stage of a proscenium theatre through which the audience sees the play; it is a metaphor for the boundary between what happens inside the work, to the characters, and outside it, to the audience.</description>

<name>large breasts</name>
<description>Large breasts are breasts a fair notch larger than average, as found in some adolescent girls or fully grown women; however, as anime has no upper limit to breast size, the definition applies somewhat differently. To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>

<name>magic circles</name>
<description>A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised.
Traditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for non-magical work such as meditation.
Generally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Lina Inverse is the primary protagonist and the only character appearing in the whole Slayers-franchise. She is an adolescent but very powerful sorceress, with a great love for money, treasure and food. In the anime and manga (but not in the light novel) Lina uses overly destructive magic recklessly, often with little provocation. She is reputed to be an evil, powerful, destructive, diminutive sorceress (the evil part is arguably not true, though one may consider her greed and general lack of concern for others unless they are in danger of being killed can be considered "evil").
Lina has gained many different nicknames, including "Bandit Killer" and "Dragon Spooker", neither of which she`s very fond of, though to her, her most embarrassing nickname is "Lina the Pink" which is her official title amongst the sorcerer`s guild.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Xellos is a mazoku and the priest of Greater Beast Zelas Metallium.
Xellos was created by Zelas during the Kouma War. The mazoku put a barrier over the peninsula and managed keep the enemy`s reinforcements out of the battle. Because of this, however, four of the five lords were unable to participate in the war anymore, so priests and generals were created in order to represent them. Because he is her only immediate servant, and he was created from a great deal of her power, Xellos is more powerful than all the other priests and generals of Ruby Eye Shabranigdu`s subordinates.
In the Kouma War, Xellos single-handedly killed thousands of golden dragons; he is feared and hated by them ever since. They refer to him as the Dragon Slayer, although he does not like this name, probably because it does not fit the "image" he wants others to view him as. After the war, before serving Hellmaster, Xelloss`s duty for a thousand years was to find stray copies of the Claire Bible and destroy them so that humans could not find an easy way to defeat mazoku (with Zanaffar), or utilise the power of the Lord of Nightmares.
Xelloss` true astral form is that of a simple black cone. He is able to divide his power into dozens of tiny cones that can inflict damage over a long period of time.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>When Lina Inverse destroyed the Dragon no Kiba (Dragon`s Fang) gang, and was later encountered by a small array of vengeful bandits, Gourry Gabriev jumped in to save her. Though Lina appreciated the offer, she initially opted against accepting Gourry as a bodyguard, but Gourry`s big-brotherly nature prevented him from acting otherwise. Gourry, dense as a brick, saw Lina as a younger girl in need of protection, and thus, he offered it.
Gourry is the owner of the most powerful sword known to man, the mysterious Sword of Light. The Sword of Light channels its users intentions into energy, usually taking the form of a gleaming blade of light. Gourry has learned how to utilize the sword`s energy in different forms, though, most notably the power of swinging it quickly downwards to form energy beam projectiles.
Gourry is the swordsman of the group, and acts the role very well. He`s single-minded in his protection of Lina, and even after helping Lina defeat Ruby-Eye Shabranigdu, he has resolved to follow Lina around wherever she goes. Supposedly, he has nothing better to do, and perhaps still sees himself as her guardian.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>When Lina Inverse overthrew the Dragon`s Fang bandit gang, one of Zelgadiss` men, Zolf, happened to be stuck inside. And, well, he got incinerated. Needless to say, Zelgadiss was mad. More importantly, though, Lina had gotten a very valuable Orihalcon statue, which was the reason Zolf was there to begin with. Zelgadiss wanted the statue in hopes that it could cure his chimaeric curse.
Only, it didn`t quite work out that way. Zelgadiss didn`t quite cure himself, even after the whole incident with Rezo, the Red Priest and Ruby-Eye Shabranigdu. So, he`s still searching for a cure, hoping to find one of the fabled Clair-Bibles in hopes to cure himself. The curse makes him 1/3 golem, 1/3 demon, and 1/3 human, which makes him impervious to most physical weapon such as swords and buckshot, but not to the physical impact of, say, a cannonball.
Zelgadiss is quite self-conscious about his appearance, almost ashamed of it. In fact, he`s a very quiet character all around, only speaking when necessary, and only interested in the shortest path to his cure. He also tends to get embarassed easily wherever the topic of romance is brought up.
Zelgadiss is a superb swordsman, having trained many long years. He often enhances his blade with the Astral Vine spell, one of many Shamanist spells at his disposal. He has more or less mastered the Spirit category of Shamanism, having learned its most powerful spell, the Ra-Tilt, among numerous other spells in other categories.</description>

<name>Amelia Wil Tesla Seyruun</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Amelia is the daughter of Philionel el de Seyruun, Crown Prince of the kingdom of Seyruun. Like her father, Amelia is a self-proclaimed Champion of Justice(tm) and is singleminded in her quest for truth, honor, and dignity. Also like her father, she`s a complete klutz and has no clue of what IS and ISN`T a true cause for justice.
Amelia has trained since birth for her cause; once convinced, she isn`t easily dissuaded from inflicting her particular flavor of justice on whoever she perceives to be an "enemy of the people". She thinks of Lina as a hero - a destructive hero, but nevertheless a hero - and wants to be just like her and every other good hero that comes along.
Amelia gets bored being royalty sometimes - she often follows her father Phil on journeys around the countryside. She often looks for trouble, simply so that she can right it. Whenever scouting out an area, she always includes a quick look for the highest place to stand.
...
Why does she always look for the highest place to stand, you ask? In case the enemy strikes, she wants to be able to strike back with a dynamic, triumphant pose of her own, terrifying the enemy with fear of justice. A lot of times, she ends up falling, too, she`s only a young girl after all. In fact, Amelia has the reputation of being one of the clumsiest characters in all of Slayers, topped only by Martina.
Amelia is also a budding sorcerer in her own right. Her specialty is white magic, however she also has reached the highest level of training in Shamanist Spirit magic, a testament to her quick learning time and eagerness to learn. She has even developed a spell or two of her own, most notably the Visfarank spell, which seems to be the glowing manifestation of justice as a pair of boxing gloves.</description>

<description>Phil is the Crown Prince of Seyruun, and presumably the only one trusted to take the throne after numerous assassination attempts. Phil, like his daughter, is dominated by his thirst for justice, so much that he has dedicated his life to being a pacifist. Or at least that`s what he says, he acts more like a pro wrestler sometimes.
Unlike most of the Seyruun royal family, Phil has no magical powers, but he does have a lot of brute strength. He uses this mostly in the form of oxymoronic, justice-themed physical attacks, such as "Pacifist Crush", "Kindness to All Creatures Kick", "Benevolent Giant Swing", and "Goodwill Towards Man Smash". His sheer brute strength is even enough to destroy lesser demons.</description>

<description>Sylphiel Nels Lahda is the daughter of Eruk, one of the nobles of Sairaag. Not too much is known about her, strangely; she just seems to show up in the oddest of places.
Sylphiel plays her role in society well - she has a very dignified manner of speaking. She is also a very kind soul, altruistic in a way. She has no wish to see any undeserving person harmed, and has dedicated her life to that cause. She has reached what many would perceive to be the highest point of White Magic, having learned the potent spells of "Resurrection" and an insanely powerful variant of "Recovery".
However, Sylphiel can`t cast any other magic worth squat, it seems. Shamanist Fire magic is almost completely beyond her grasp; it seems that she might lack the drive to even be capable of causing destruction. Then again, she can if she wants to - she knows a very powerful Black Magic spell, the "Dragu-Slave". In fact, she learned it simply by watching Lina cast it.</description>

<description>Hellmaster Phibrizzo was created during the Shinma War, and is over 5000 years old. Though the Shinma War has ended, the overall conflict between shinzoku and mazoku has not. Shabranigdu at some point created five subordinates of his own: Hellmaster Fibrizo, Chaos Dragon Garv, Greater Beast Zelas Metallium, Dynast Grausherra, and Deep Sea Dolphin.
Hellmaster Phibrizzo is the strongest of the five subordinates in service to Ruby Eye Shabranigdu, lord of the underworld, and controller of life and death. Hellmaster`s priest and general were destroyed in the Kouma War, and it is assumed that to create new ones would deplete much of his existing power.
Despite his power and eagerness to fulfill his master`s goals of destroying everything in existence, Phibrizzo rarely involved himself in the day to day matters of the world; he was more of the scheming type. He was known to patiently wait for hundreds or even thousands of years, and when everything was in place, unleash his plan to the most devastating effect. He was the one who ignited the Kouma War, which at first was a conflict between humans, to use the horrors of the war to awaken the piece of Shabranigdu in Lei Magnus, one of the Five Great Sages. He apparently succeeded, turning the war into one of the greatest conflicts of all time. However, in the end, Lei Magnus-Shabranigdu was sealed into ice, and Phibrizzo`s ultimate goal wasn`t achieved.</description>

<description>Chaos Dragon Garv was created during the Shinma War, and is over 5000 years old. Though the Shinma War has ended, the overall conflict between shinzoku and mazoku has not. Shabranigdu at some point created five subordinates of his own: Hellmaster Fibrizo, Chaos Dragon Garv, Greater Beast Zelas Metallium, Dynast Grausherra, and Deep Sea Dolphin.
Garv`s human form is a roughly middle aged man with long red hair wearing a trench coat and carrying a huge sword; his beast form is an enormous three headed red dragon. Although the exact details are unknown, this similarity to shinzoku in form is no coincidence: In the Kouma War, Ruby Eye Shabranigdu specificly required his assistance to defeat Aqualord Ragradia, although the Maou had a stronger minion, Hellmaster Fibrizo at his disposal.
The victory over the Aqualord came with a price for Garv, however, as Ragradia used the last amounts of his power to seal Garv into his human form. He hoped that similarly to Shabranigdu, Garv`s power would slowly diminish as he is reborn over and over again. But for inexplicable reasons, the result was the complete opposite: Garv became stronger with each rebirth.</description>

He soon became obsessed with fighting Gourry, to see who was the better swordsman.
He and Gourry eventually had a duel in Rezo`s lab, but after Gourry won in the end, Zangulus left on his way. He later reappeared towards the end of Slayers NEXT, looking for a rematch. However, since Gourry was being held prisoner by Hellmaster Phibrizzo at the time, Zangulus did not get a chance to properly duel him a second time. He did, however, help Lina and the others fight Hellmaster.
It was during this time that Zangulus met and fell in love with http://anidb.net/ch7879 [Martina Zoana Mel Navratilova], whom he married after the battle with Hellmaster.
Zangulus is a character created by the anime staff, as he does not appear in the original novels or the manga. He can still be considered a canon character, as the series` plot and cast was written, supervised and approved by Hajime Kanzaka.</description>

<description>Alfred Saillune is a member of the Saillune royal family. He is the son of Christopher Wil Brogg Saillune, who is the younger brother of the Crown Prince Philionel El Di Saillune. Alfred`s father had always been jealous of the fact that it was Philionel and not him who was the crown prince. Every time Alfred came to his father for advice, Christopher would usually just complain about his own circumstances. Not surprisingly, this resentment rubbed off on Alfred. Unlike his father, however, Alfred chose to act on his resentment, and begin a plot to seize the throne.</description>
