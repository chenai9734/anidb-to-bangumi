<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="467099">i never watched the original series it just felt way too dated these summaries on the other hand with their updated audio tracks i found are much easier to get into and i do recommend them as an alternative to the series so far i don`t feel lost in the plot as most summaries often do.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="738147">The original series can be very long winded and slow paced. This summary movie just wraps everything up. Movie`s pace is very smooth. It made me understand what the series is all about. I don`t feel lost or missing important plot components. Overall very nicely executed.</recommendation>

<description>In the year 0079 of the Universal Century, the Earth Federation and its space colonies are engaged in an apocalyptic war. The rebellious Principality of Zeon, using humanoid fighting machines called mobile suits, has all but vanquished the Federation. Now the Federation`s last hope is the prototype mobile suit Gundam. When a twist of fate makes young civilian Amuro Ray the Gundam`s pilot, his own battle begins - a struggle not only for the Federation`s survival, but for his own.
Note: This movie roughly corresponds to the episodes 1-13 of the first http://anidb.net/a715 [Gundam TV series].</description>

<name>robot</name>
<description>A robot is an automatically guided machine, able to do tasks on its own. Another common characteristic is that by its appearance or movements, a robot often conveys a sense that it has intent or agency of its own.
Not to be confused with android (human-like robot).</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>war</name>
<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<description>The Republic of Zeon was initially founded by Zeon Zum Deikun, who declared the colony located at the second Earth-Luna Lagrangian Point, named Side 3, independent from the Earth Federation in U.C.0058. For the next several years, Zeon Zum Deikun and his followers dealt with diplomatic issues surrounding their independence, chiefly the economic pressure applied to Side 3 by the Earth Federation, in their efforts to force Side 3 back into the Federation. During this time, Side 3 formed its first national guard unit. Unfortunately, for the Republic of Zeon, Zeon Zum Deikun unexpectedly died (almost certainly assassinated by the Zabis) in UC 0068, leaving Side 3 without a leader. After the end of the One Year War, the Republic was re-established with a pro-Earth Federation puppet government.</description>

<description>The unified world government that launched the space settlement program and now rules over both Earth and the space colonies. Its main decision-making body is the Earth Federation Assembly, which meets occasionally to pass new legislation.
Though not as cruel and aggressive as the Principality of Zeon`s leaders, the bureaucrats who rule over the Earth Federation are corrupt, weak-willed, and insensitive to the space colonists` desire for independence. After the One Year War, the Federation decides to concentrate its energies on reconstructing Earth instead of the space colonies, further increasing political tensions.</description>

<name>Haro</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Haro is the mechanical mascot of the Gundam science fiction anime metaseries, and is the only character that appears in more than one timeline.
The original Haro is a little robot companion built by the main character Amuro Ray. It is a cute testament to Amuro`s exceptional talent for machines. Haro`s features include a limited range of speech, and the ability to hover (in environments with atmosphere and low gravity) by flapping its ear-like appendage coverings. Haro can usually be found rolling behind Amuro`s next door neighbor Frau Bow. The ability to detect brain waves is also one of Haro`s functions; in one of the episodes, Haro actually claimed that the brain wave of Amuro was lowered/different.
In Zeta Gundam, a mass-produced Mk-II version of Haro ends up in the hands of that series` main protagonist Kamille Bidan, who initially suspects it to be the original. He repairs the robot, only to have it constantly address him as Amuro.
During the events of Char`s Counterattack, Amuro gives a "third-generation" Haro to Hathaway, the son of his captain Bright Noa.
Haro continues to permeate the Gundam franchise, having appeared in Gundam SEED as Lacus Clyne`s multi-colored horde of simple-speech robot pets, built for her by Athrun Zala. These Haros are roughly 1/4 the size of their Universal Century counterparts and are similar in function, however a few possess certain abilities such as unlocking doors. Lacus`s favorite Haro is a pink machine that she refers to as "Pink-Chan" (often translated as "Mr. Pink" or "Pinky"). Another notable Haro in Lacus`s collection is "Navy-Chan", a navy blue robot on which she paints a mustache bearing a distinct resemblance the facial ornament of the ∀ Gundam of the CC (正歴 Seireki) calendar system. The rest of Lacus` Haros have been seen in yellow, orange, blue, green, and black. The parody comic Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Club Yonkoma states that Athrun has built a total of 35 Haros for Lacus.
In Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Celestial Being had produced unknown numbers of Haros as an assistant of daily maintenance works. Currently at least 6 unique Haros have appeared in the animation production. The Haros in the series took much more maintenance and combat role than any other series` counterpart, usually seeing them operating with various machines, including mobile weapons.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>At the beginning of the Mobile Suit Gundam TV series, Sayla is a civilian of Side 7, who comes aboard the mobile suit carrier White Base along with other civilians include Amuro Ray, Fraw Bow, Hayato Kobayashi, Kai Shiden and Mirai Yashima. Sayla is a Newtype much like her brother Char Aznable.
Originally a medical student on Side 7, Sayla is almost immediately recruited as a soldier, and set to the task of watching over the civilian refugees. With the near total lack of experienced personnel to defend White Base (most original regular officers were KIA in Zeon`s Side 7 attack), Bright Noa assigns Sayla to the multiple positions of communications officer, medical officer, navigator, and finally combat pilot.
Soon after joining the ship, she repeatedly looks for her brother Casval, and takes every opportunity to learn information about him and make contact. When Bright picks up a suspicious briefcase (later revealed to be full of gold bars) intended for Sayla, he confronts her and she admits that her true identity as Artesia Som Deikun, sister to Casval Rem Deikun (better known as Char Aznable), and the only daughter of Zeon Zum Deikun, the founder of the Republic of Zeon.</description>

<description>Hayato, with his black belt in judo, would be the first to warn you not underestimate him just because of his size. After the attack on Side 7, the pint-sized Hayato joins the White Base crew and volunteers for pilot training, largely out of a sense of rivalry with his former neighbor Amuro. Though his fighting skills can`t compare to Amuro`s, Hayato is loyal, fearless, and determined.</description>

<description>Another of the White Base`s crew of civilian recruits, Kai is a confirmed coward and cynic - the smart-mouthed black sheep of the White Base crew. While his fellow pilots are struggling to save the ship, Kai can often be found cowering behind them, or mocking them from the sidelines. Still, he`ll do his part when he must, and as the series continues Kai begins to understand what he and his comrades are fighting for.</description>

<description>The jovial Ryu, a Federation Forces pilot trainee, is one of the only survivors of the White Base`s original crew. Ryu`s combination of good humour and military background lets him intercede between uptight captain Bright and the ship`s civilian pilots. Despite his training, Ryu is a fairly reckless pilot, often rushing into the middle of battle in a puny Core Fighter in an attempt to help out his fellow pilots.</description>

Given his youth and inexperience, it`s clear Garma owes his position to his family`s favour, and he is desperate to prove himself worthy of it. When his military-academy buddy Char Aznable drives the White Base into his territory, Garma is easily persuaded to risk his life in pursuit of this grand trophy.</description>

<description>Degwin is the patriarch of the Zabi family which rules the Principality of Zeon. Ten years ago, the revolutionary leader Zeon Zum Deikun - the man who led the space colonies of Side 3 to independence - expired under suspicious circumstances, leaving Degwin as his apparent successor. Degwin then established the Principality and led it to war against the Earth Federation. But now, after a year of conflict, the old tyrant has grown weary of the fighting, and his ambitious son Gihren has usurped much of Degwin`s power.</description>

<description>This Pegasus-class mobile assault carrier, the besieged home of our crew of young heroes, is the first Earth Federation warship designed to carry mobile suits into battle. Its decks can hold up to nine mobile suits and fighters, and its armament includes a main gun turret, two mega particle cannons, a battery of missile launchers, and countless anti-aircraft guns. Thanks to its Minovsky craft system, the White Base can survive the heat of atmospheric re-entry, and then float effortlessly across the surface of the Earth. The soldiers of the Principality of Zeon, unaware of its true name, give the White Base the nickname "Trojan Horse."</description>
