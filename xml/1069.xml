<description>It begins with a tournament, organized as a birthday present for Dollar Money, the son of Gyusan Money, the richest man in the world. The combatants are to fight simultaneously, until there are only four contestants left. At this point, the remaining four were to fight four "aliens", and whoever finished first was to fight Mr. Satan for the grand prize. The first half of the movie is mainly comedy, with Gohan, Mirai no Trunks, and Kuririn fighting their way through the tournament, becoming three of the four finalists. All the while Goku is watching his son from heaven, and Mr. Satan is engaged in his usual antics in trying to get away from "Those people!" The second half begins when, in the final rounds, the four "Aliens" have most obviously been replaced with REAL aliens- led by one named Bojack. Bojack had apparently tried to fight the gods some time ago, and was imprisoned in a star. Kaiou`s death during the Cell game freed him, and he was trying to get special revenge on the North Kaiou by taking his student`s planet first. Trunks defeats his opponent, but loses to Bojack, while Kuririn and Daisuke both lose to theirs- at the cost of Daisuke`s life. Gohan doesn`t finish his fight before all of the villains convene and introduce themselves, thus spawning one of the finest one-sided movie fight scenes yet, which lasts until everyone is trashed and Gohan is being crushed to death by Bojack. Goku, breaking the afterlife rules, teleports out of heaven in an effort to save Gohan. Gohan then goes SSJ2 and kills two out of the three henchmen, and Gohan then kills Bojack. The movie ends with everybody recovering in the hospital, a typical happy movie ending.
Note: Screened as a triple feature with http://anidb.net/a1084 [Yuu Yuu Hakusho (1993)] and http://anidb.net/a6624 [Dr. Slump: Arale-chan Ncha! Penguin Mura yori Ai o Komete].</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>henshin</name>
<description>Japanese for "transformation" (metamorphosis or disguise).
A "henshin anime" is any anime, where the characters or their costumes transform, such as Sailor Moon. The henshin switches on the character`s special powers, and is frequently accompanied by a costume change. Often the change of clothing is the only outward indicator that the character has changed and yet nobody seems to notice the hero`s true self.
Most henshin heroes have a special item which they use to change into their heroic form. These items are usually activated by a command phrase (which is often in Engrish, for some reason), triggering a transformation sequence.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Mr. Satan (known as Hercule in the English adaptations) is a flamboyant martial artist. After http://anidb.net/ch2103 [Gokuu] and his companions stop attending the Tenkaichi Budoukai, Mr. Satan starts winning them and becomes the reigning champion for many years.
On a Q&amp;A with mangaka http://anidb.net/cr1902 [Toriyama Akira] published in Super Exciting Guide - Character Volume on April 3, 2009, it is revealed that Mr. Satan is just a stage/ring name and that his actual first name is "Mark". While it seems like a common name, it is actually written out in katakana as マーク (maaku). If you rearrange the syllables, as you would with many names in the series to derive their puns, you end up with akuma (meaning "devil" or "demon"), which is in concordance with his daughter`s name being a pun on the English word "devil".
During the Cell Games, he attempts to fight http://anidb.net/ch24822 [Cell], but even after being swatted away, he is given credit for Cell`s death by the media. He is soon called a world hero, gaining great wealth and a city named after him. Though Gokuu and his companions find his inflated ego and arrogance very annoying, he becomes close to them after befriending the good http://anidb.net/ch41758 [Majin Buu] and by helping defeat Kid Buu by using his appeal to the people of Earth to get energy for the Genki Dama. His daughter, http://anidb.net/ch12209 [Videl], marries http://anidb.net/ch9915 [Gohan].</description>

In Bojack Unbound, Zangya fought Krillin at his battle zone, which was full of lava. She easily defeated him. Later, Gohan and the other Z Fighters fought Zangya and the rest of Bojack`s henchmen.
After Gohan killed Bujin and Bido, Zangya backed away in fear. Then Bojack attempted to distract Gohan by pushing Zangya in front of him and shooting an energy blast through her at Gohan, killing Zangya.</description>
