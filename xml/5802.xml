<description>* Based on Youkow Osada`s Ten no Haou - Hokuto no Ken Raou Gaiden manga spin-off, serialised in Comic Bunch.
Unlike most of the previous Fist of the North Star anime, this story focuses not on the protagonist Kenshiro, but on the early life of his oldest brother and frequent enemy Raou.

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>post-apocalyptic</name>
<description>An anime that takes place on future Earth (or it could be an alternative universe) after a major cataclysm has occurred. World War III, an alien invasion, plague, global warming or some other general disaster are common themes to build a post-apocalyptic world upon, where the effects were severe enough that mankind barely survived.
The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologised). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in an agrarian, non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of technology remain. There is a considerable degree of blurring between post-apocalyptic fiction and that which deals with false utopias or dystopian societies.</description>

<name>gore</name>
<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

After his mind was corrupted by Jagi, Shin challenged Kenshirou and defeated him, engraving the seven scars on his chest, subsequently taking off with Yuria by force.
He then forms the King organisation and builds Yuria the city of Southern Cross. However, he is unable to win Yuria`s love and after her failed suicide attempt, Shin entrusts her to the Nanto Goshasei for her protection. Sometime after, he is challenged by Kenshirou in his lair and is defeated. Refusing to die from Kenshirou`s technique, he takes his own life by jumping off the roof of his own palace, while maintaining that Yuria has died.</description>

<description>Souther represents the "Star of Leadership", which rules over the other Nanto stars. His fighting style is Nanto Hou-ouken ("South Star Phoenix Fist), the strongest of the Nanto Seiken, which is a purely offensive style with no defensive stance. Souther was orphaned as an infant and was raised by the previous Hou-ouken successor, Oogai, who trained him during childhood. During his final training lesson, Souther unwillingly killed his master, who intentionally allowed himself to be killed by Souther. Traumatised by the event, Souther disavowed all feelings of love and compassion. After the Nuclear War, he takes on the title of Holy Emperor and enslaves children with his army in order to construct the Holy Cross Mausoleum, a shrine to his deceased master.
Kenshirou challenges Souther, but his Hokuto Shinken techniques proves to be ineffective against him and is brutally defeated and captured. Kenshirou escapes and challenges Souther again. This time, he learns the secret of Souther`s immunity (he has dextrocardia, affecting the locations of his pressure points), and is able to defeat him.</description>

<description>Reina`s brother. Master of Suuzan Senpuu Kyaku "Songshan Whirlwind Kick". He and his sister left the Land of Asura to join Raou`s army and become his loyal followers. He lost his right leg at Cassandra and wears a prosthetic. After he was struck with a fatal attack by Gaiya which gave him a mere two months to live, he came up with a ruse to scare Raou`s men out of any inclinations of desertion or rebellion. He made it look as if he had allowed an assassin into Raou`s palace and Raou subsequently killed him in front of his horrified troops.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Ryuuga is the elder brother of Yuria and the successor of the Taizan Tenrouken "Mt. Tai Celestial Wolf Fist" style, which allows him to scoop the chunks of his enemies` flesh while leaving them with a feeling of coldness. He represents the solitary star of Sirius (The Heavenly Wolf Star), which is neither, part of the Hokuto nor Nantou constellations. After the nuclear war, Ryuuga pledges his loyalty to Raou, believing that his tyranny will restore order to the world. However, he begins to doubt Raou`s methods when he meets his sister`s fiancée Kenshirou, the other Hokuto Shinken master.
Ryuuga decides to challenge Kenshirou by kidnapping Toki and keeping him captive in his castle. Kenshirou defeats him, only to find out that Ryuuga was already dying, having slit his own stomach before the battle.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Juda is the successor of Nanto Koukakuken ("South Star Crimson Crane Fist"), a style specializing in long range attacks.
Representing the Star of Enchantment, also known as the Star of Betrayal, Juda declares himself to be the strongest and most beautiful of fighters, willing to betray his own subordinates for his own self-gain. Juda trained alongside Rei while they were still learning Nanto Seiken and became envious that Rei`s elegant fighting style was given more recognition than his own among his peers. Seeking to avenge Mamiya`s honor (who was once part of Juda`s harem of female slaves), Rei challenges Juda to a match. After being defeated by Rei, Juda concedes that Rei is the more beautiful of the two and admits that he secretly admired Rei before dying.</description>
