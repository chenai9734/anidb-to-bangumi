<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="333496">Directed at 14-year old teenagers. Decent series but childish (moralistic) ending. !Do not read titels of yet-to-see episodes out of boredom! They spoil big time!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="77420">A very entertaining action show that gets bogged down by the 2nd half (around episode 30). Some characters are forgotten, others become boring and the plot really goes downhill culminating in a very lame ending. Still, the 1st half is worth it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="181147">Fun and violent!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="175387">A nice shounen anime to watch and wait for... +10 for recommendation ^_^</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="260343">It´s a good series but only up to the point it keeps track with the manga! It`s a pity it ends the way it ends (a made up poor ending that is simply pathetic).  If your new to soul eater you will love the anime. If your a true fan (Manga) don`t come near! Stick with the manga! XD</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="608137">Funny action anime, but it is incomplete, so you have to read the manga to see the rest of the story.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="208300">Very good anime for those who like action and ecchi! AA+ RECOMMENDED!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="18364">This series has a very unique artstyle, so I`d recommend watching it for that alone. Aside from that, it also has awesome action sequences, likable characters and some humor thrown in for good measure. That said, one of the antagonists, Medusa, is absolutely bland and flat as a character, so she just winds up being annoying. Additionally, the anime diverges from the manga at the very end, resulting in a pretty lackluster ending.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="528166">Give it a chance if you`re not sure on watching it.
First 30 or so episodes were great but the last bit felt as if they rushed through and that impacted the story.
Hopefully there will be a season 2.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="194080">Exactly what I have been looking for in anime for years, great charachters, amazing action that looks almost motion captured at times and an even amount of fan service to top it off.  Only problems so far is they have cut out a few awsome scenes from what I have seen in the manga, might have been due to time constraints, logic holes, or other difficulties, but whatever the reason panty interigation should never be removed!  Anyhow, pretty closely follows the manga and is one of the best if not my personal favorite anime.</recommendation>

Very amusing characters with diverse skills and attitudes.

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="36032">Excellent and unusual.&lt;br /&gt;The legend begins in the 12th century!</recommendation>

<description>* Based on a shounen manga by http://anidb.net/cr9469 [Ookubo Atsushi] serialised in Shounen Gangan.
Set in the Shinigami technical school for weapon technicians, the series revolves around three pairs of two characters with each having a weapon technician and a human weapon. They try to make the latter a "Death Scythe" and thus fit for use by the Shinigami. They must collect the souls of 99 evil humans and one witch to do this.
[i]Note: There were two versions of Soul Eater. The first was a normal version which aired on Mondays and the second was a "Late Show" version which aired on Thursday nights. The "Late Show" version had some extra scenes added during eye-catches and before the next episode preview but the main part of the show didn`t have any differences from the normal version.
The series was rebroadcast on TV Tokyo under the title Soul Eater: Repeat Show (ソウルイーター リピートショー) from September 30, 2010, featuring new opening and closing themes.[/i]</description>

<name>juujin</name>
<description>Kemono, "beast", is a genre of Japanese art and character design that prominently features anthropomorphic animal characters. It is used widely in visual arts, especially drawing and painting, and can be found in many manga, anime, and video game.
Anthropomorphic animal characters in the kemono genre are frequently called juujin, "therianthrope"; the kanji for juujin are also sometimes pronounced kemonobito, "beast-human". While their design differs from artist to artist, they generally employ animal traits considered cute and endearing; most kemono characters retain a fundamentally human personality, however, seldom behaving as the actual animals from which they have been anthropomorphized, and as such they are typically depicted living as humans do.
Juujin leans more on the human-looking side when compared to http://anidb.net/t2857 [anthropomorphism], which leans more on the animal-looking side.

<name>horny nosebleed</name>
<description>In Japanese media, healthy young men who have no other sexual outlet will often suffer nosebleeds upon seeing the naked female body, or even just a pair of well-filled panties.
The nosebleed is, of course, a visual shorthand/euphemism for sexual arousal. It is commonly interpreted that way for males and females, with little trickles of blood indicating mild arousal, and gushing fountains of blood indicating erection/extreme arousal in both sexes. It can also be interpreted as shorthand strictly for erections in males. In that case, when blood shoots from the nose explosively, and in ridiculous quantity, the implication would be an ejaculation.

<name>immortality</name>
<description>Immortality is the ability to live in a physical or spiritual form for an infinite or inconceivably vast length of time. Humans, whose life span is limited and who die of age, disease and external trauma, have long sought ways to extend their lives; the Epic of Gilgamesh, considered one of the first great literary works created by mankind, is primarily the quest of a hero seeking to become immortal. The advances of science, in particular medicine and engineering, and especially in the last few centuries, have helped people extend their life span and may yet continue finding ways to do so.
In fiction, immortals are not quite as uncommon as in real life, and the possible implications of endless or very long lives are often explored. Such implications include, but are not limited to: repeatedly accompanying the deaths of those dear to them; having to hide their condition from the mortals surrounding them; becoming disillusioned with their lives and being unable to kill themselves; and even staying forever trapped in the body of a specific physical age, that body most often being that of a child. As such, while many may wish for immortality, it may be little more than a curse for the few who have it.</description>

<name>vampire</name>
<description>A vampire is a mythological or folkloric nocturnal undead. Vampires use long fangs to penetrate the necks of people, usually young females, to drink their blood, both as a form of nourishment and to turn the targets into slaves.
In the classic vampire stories, they are thought to have no reflection in mirrors, are able to shapeshift into bats (sometimes also wolves or some form of fog), have unlimited lifespan and superhuman strength, reflexes and senses, and may only be killed by silver bullets, silver blades, a stake through the heart, fire, or exposure to sunlight; on the other hand, they cannot tolerate garlic, holy water, or Christian crosses (sometimes expanded to religious symbols in general).
In modern anime, these limitations are usually dropped, and they become far more powerful and fearsome opponents than usual. A human bitten, or sometimes even scratched, by a vampire typically becomes a slave, eventually dying as if poisoned, and becoming a vampire, ghoul, zombie, or other form of undead after death, often staying under the command of the vampire who originally bit them.</description>

<description>A catgirl (nekomusume, 猫娘) is a girl that has a cat`s characteristics, a form of zoomorphism.
They can appear either as normal girls without any obvious cat traits —such as eyes, ears, paws, or a tail— or as girls who have one or more of these traits. In the former case they are usually cats that have become human through the means of magic. The feline features are added for moe and/or sexiness appeal, with the most common features being cat ears and tail. Nya~, the Japanese equivalent of meow, is often used by girls acting cute and is not a trait exclusive to catgirls.
Not to be confused with characters who simply are wearing a http://anidb.net/t1622 [cat ears accessory] (nekomimi, 猫耳) as a fashion accessory. Catgirls with cat ears should also be tagged with http://anidb.net/t2541 [animal ears].</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>A mafia is a type of organized crime syndicate whose primary activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions. Secondary activities may be practiced such as gambling, drug trafficking, loan sharking, and fraud. The term was originally applied to the Sicilian mafia, but has since expanded to encompass other organizations of similar methods and purpose, such as in "the Russian mafia" or "the Japanese mafia", and is applied informally by the press and public, but the criminal organizations themselves have their own terms; for example, the original Sicilian and Italian-American mafia call themselves "cosa nostra", while the Japanese mafia calls itself "yakuza".

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<description>Japanese for "transformation" (metamorphosis or disguise).
A "henshin anime" is any anime, where the characters or their costumes transform, such as Sailor Moon. The henshin switches on the character`s special powers, and is frequently accompanied by a costume change. Often the change of clothing is the only outward indicator that the character has changed and yet nobody seems to notice the hero`s true self.
Most henshin heroes have a special item which they use to change into their heroic form. These items are usually activated by a command phrase (which is often in Engrish, for some reason), triggering a transformation sequence.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<description>Alcohol (or more scientifically, ethanol), is one of the world`s oldest psychoactive substances. It is traditionally found in the form of a beverage such as beer, wine, or liquor, although in some contexts it can be inhaled to produce similar or intoxication, and some people prefer another way of consuming beverage-form alcohol.
Alcoholic beverages are many and varied, due to production methods (fermentation or distillation), source materials (grains, fruits, vegetables, other plants), added substances such as flavorings, and many more ways of defining different forms of alcoholic beverages.
Alcoholic beverages are divided into three general classes: beers, wines, and spirits. They are legally consumed in most countries, and over 100 countries have laws regulating their production, sale, and consumption. In particular, such laws specify the minimum age at which a person may legally buy or drink them. This minimum age varies between 16 and 25 years, depending upon the country and the type of drink. Most nations set it at 18 years of age.</description>

<description>A person`s body is taken over by some foreign intelligence. It`s not brainwashing, because they still have control of their own mind — but that`s all they have. Either they`ve been reduced to a spectator in their own body, or their soul has been booted out of their body entirely. Either way, the rest of the cast will soon find he`s not himself.</description>

<name>talking is a free action</name>
<description>Time in comics is flexible. Each panel shows a single event, which is usually accompanied by a length of dialog, which must take some time to say. This disparity is usually accepted if it isn`t taken to extremes.
But often, characters will exposit when it`s most needed: at the story`s climax, when both the intricacies of the plot and the intensity of action hit their highest.
While the Heroes Outrun the Fireball, Mr. Exposition might explain why the Evil Overlord`s death caused the explosion. The Action Girl can deliver impressive lectures on why the monster`s Achilles` Heel will work, while still engaging in Waif-Fu. The Superhero can quip to his heart`s content and explain his abilities while dueling one insignificant mobster, or deliver a Kirk Summation during the course of a single Finishing Move. Sometimes even apparent mere mortals can give a lecture on what is happening when it would be a much better idea to simply run like hell.
Without stopping to breathe, apparently.

<description>Computer-generated imagery (CGI) or computer animation is the art of creating moving images via the use of computers. It is a subfield of computer graphics and animation.

Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another medium, such as film.</description>

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

Another use of narration comes in the form of a dominant voice belonging to one of the protagonists, intended only for the viewer and revealing the intimate thoughts to whom it belongs. This type of narration occurs frequently throughout the duration of the episode or movie.</description>

<description>Unimportant random/extra characters that appear mostly as part of the background are often drawn without much facial details, normally to save money, effort and manpower for more important parts of the show. Sometimes, they have almost or no facial details, meaning their heads only have indications of the presence of parts such as hair or mouth, or not even that. This can go as far as only drawing an abstracted silhouette of the whole body.</description>

Feelings of any kind towards other characters are best shown by calling each other`s name, loud, REALLY LOUD. For better effect at least twice or thrice. For lover`s couples and mortal enemies it is a requirement to run towards each other while calling each other`s name, unaware of the surroundings.</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

The basic purpose of the host varies on what the point was for it to have been hijacked in the first place. Sometimes it`s used as a disguise, other times it`s used as a decoy and destraction, even simply being used as a weapon and piece of armor that the possessor uses to cause sheer chaos and destruction, but sometimes... a host can be used for fetish fuel.</description>

<description>Maka is Soul`s meister. They live together in an appartment in Death City, though Maka seems to be the one doing most of the household chores such as cooking. Where Soul seems to be the brawn, Maka is the brain. She always tries to think of a way to beat their opponent by exploiting the opponent`s weaknesses. Maka and Soul make an efficient team, as shown at the start of the series when they had already claimed ninety-nine evil souls. Maka is a dedicated student at Shibusen, and scored highest of her class during doctor Stein`s test. Maka`s father is Shinigami`s current death scythe and her mother was a very powerful scythe meister. They are currently divorced. While she adores her mother, Maka`s relationship with her father is strained. She seems to hate him for constantly flirting with other women (which caused the divorce). Deep down she still loves him though.</description>

Soul`s personality mostly consists of what he considers "cool". Being a "cool" guy, he almost always uses the direct approach which most of the time fails, and even drives a motorcycle, which both he and Maka use for transportation. He sometimes becomes too driven by the idea of eating souls, which leads him to bicker with Maka, but in the end they remain friends and partners. He may be in love with her as he is "willing to die for his technician". He is also friends with Black Star because of their similar personalities, but at the same time they cannot match each other`s wavelength.</description>

Even though his parents and family were killed, Black Star bears no grudge over this. He accepts his parents` death because of the evil life they lived. The star tattoo on Black Star`s right shoulder sometimes causes him trouble, as it marks him as a Star Clan ninja who are still hated and feared to this day in some villages.</description>

<description>He is Patti and Liz`s meister and the Shinigami`s son. He is called Kid by his friends and family. He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder, which is represented as a complete obsession about everything being symmetrical and takes the idea of perfection to the extremes. To him, anything symmetrical is beautiful and if it is off by any measurement (a picture frame off by millimetre, or a pose that is slightly out of place), he will try to correct it right away, even if the situation calls for utmost attention. The biggest problem Kid has is with his hair because one side being completely black while the other has three white strips going across it. His hair was referred to by Mosquito as Sanzu Lines, and that since they have not connected Kid is not at full power, but with a reaction to BREW, Kid reattached the arm he lost to Mosquito and was shown to have one of the lines connect on the other side of his head. He also showcased new abilities, like upgrading the calibre of Kid`s shots from Patti and Liz from .38 to .42 and changing his guns to visually match the Israeli made Desert Eagle (which have the words Death Eagle engraved on them). Showing Kid anything that is too asymmetrical or mentioning his hair will send him into a state of massive depression (which normally takes encouragement from Patti and Liz to break). In the most extreme of cases, Kid will cough up blood and faint; this is usually set off by his hair being cut, or completely failing to make something symmetrical.</description>

<description>Shinigami, referred to with the suffix sama as a term of respect, is the God of Death himself (the Grim Reaper of Western legends). He is the leader of Shibusen and the most powerful character in the series—with the kishin Asura being the only other character shown to match him in power. Eight hundred years prior to founding Shibusen, Shinigami used his own soul to seal Asura under the school. He is therefore unable to ever leave Death City. Back then he wore a more skull-like mask and spoke in a much scarier manner, but changed to not scare the children of his school. Though he acts and appears like a joker, if provoked he will return to his serious and threatening demeanour.</description>

Even though he visits clubs, he is still insanely loyal to his ex-wife and daughter. He usually runs yelling about how much he loves Maka and her mother (he calls Maka`s mother Mama). He is extremely sad that his daughter hates him, but he still tries to be a good father by looking out for her in his own silly way. Spirit is consistently shown to be a warm, caring, sensitive, and kind-hearted man. Aside from his love for Maka, he is compassionate towards children in general.</description>

<description>He acts like a big brother or even a father to Angela. Mifune carries a giant holster full of katana with him wrapped in police tape saying `Keep Out`, along with a single one in a normal scabbard at his side. When his aura is visible in a later battle when he does not unwrap this tape (remaining around the holster) the `Keep Out` is visibly part of it, surrounding the sphere.</description>

<description>The first real witch introduced in the series. She is nothing more than a kid witch that is not very good at magic, which is the reason Mifune is protecting her. In the past she was often being kidnapped by Mafia families. Mifune, who was working for the Mafia boss Marlon was sent to kill her but he betrayed his boss by `kidnapping` her instead as to protect her. She cares for Mifune and calls anyone that fights with him a bully (even if he started the fight). Her animal theme seems to be chameleons due to her hat`s appearance and the entrance of her castle. The only magic she has shown is partial invisibility.</description>

When Crona finally tells Ragnarok to stop, Ragnarok seems surprised at Crona`s reaction. Ragnarok has taken to absorbing any soul, evil or not.</description>

<description>Excalibur is the legendary sword used by heroes and kings. He has a great power that is unmatched by any other weapon. Anyone can use Excalibur, even without matching his soul resonance. Unfortunately there are few who can put up with Excalibur`s personality. He has an incredible ego, and tends to go on long rants that seem to go nowhere. In exchange for his help, Excalibur demands his meister to perform a list of one thousand tasks (such as listening to Excalibur`s daily five-hour recital sessions). Unlike his weapon form Excalibur`s humanoid form is far from elegant, looking like a cartoonish anthropomorphic creature with a very long snout, dressed in a white suit and top hat (though wearing no pants) and carrying a cane. Excalibur often uses the word "fool", usually to stop other people talking and draw attention back to him.</description>

<description>The demon blade, Masamune, is an extremely dangerous weapon and Tsubaki`s older brother. He wanders around, possessing others to use him as their weapon to collect any soul he wants. He speaks using ancient words and likes to write haiku. He plays on the fears of others to possess and use them until he takes over their soul. He believes only the strong survive and the weak live only to serve the strong. He developed this way of thinking when Tsubaki inherited the family`s multiple weapon forms. He considers himself more worthy than her and believed that he should have gotten the multiple weapon forms. He later lets Tsubaki defeat and absorb him after he sees that she really does care about him. Which gives her his katana form and all of his abilities, simultaneously being the first soul that Tsubaki successfully absorbs. He now resides deep within Tsubaki in the form of a large deer.</description>

<description>Free`s actual name was lost during the years in Witch Jail but called himself Free as he escaped with the help of Eruka. He was placed in Witch Jail for taking Mabaa`s left eye, and above his left eye, instead of an eyebrow, it reads NOFUTURE. He has a silly personality. For example, he said he wanted to dig out of the jail using a spoon like in the movies, and started hitting his head on a tree when Eruka told him of a different yet cliché way of escaping (although he easily could have escaped on his own through conventional means). He is from the Immortal Clan therefore he cannot die (thus granting him a soul mixed of various parts), which is why Mabaa locked him up since she could not kill him. He uses ice magic and the iron ball still locked on his leg to fight. He is also a werewolf and constantly says, "Wolf wolves wolf wolves" when he is on the verge of unleashing a new spell. This form of chanting is comparable to that of the witches, who also base their spells around certain, similar words and themes (Medusa`s snakes, for example).</description>

He calls himself the "Skilled General Lightning King" a fact that annoys Black Star because they are two different titles `King` and `General`. He also has one-sided feelings for Kim, which he does not hide. Later in the series when he attempts to rescue Kim from Arachnophobia and displays his sincere adoration for her, Kim starts to reciprocate his feelings. He constantly studies, but claims that outside he is a beast. One notable feature he has is his hairstyle which is shaved except for the sides, which are styled into ox-like horns, he styles it this way every morning. His attacks focus on using Harvar`s lightning powers on contact. He can also perform anti-air and anti-ground attacks.</description>

Kilik also seems to be pretty agile, having the second best running time in Shibusen after Black Star. He seems to be on the brash side, as he tried to immediately find Kim after she fled Shibusen. His partners Fire and Thunder are earth shamans and can hear the earth`s voice. His attacks emphasize on the raw punching power of his elemental pots. He can conduct a Soul Resonance with one of the pots, to use a more powerful attack with that pot, or a Soul Resonance with both to attack the opponent with both fire and lightning.</description>

<name>Ashura</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The strongest and most dangerous antagonist in Soul Eater, and the first demon god, or kishin. He was supposedly a human who existed before Shibusen, although Shinigami wondered whether he was really human to begin with. Asura had strange habits, covering his head with long scarves and wearing five to six shirts on his body; all because he did not trust anyone. In appearance he is rather skinny, and each strand of hair on his head looks like an eye, the symbol for kishin. He was the strongest member of the "Eight Powerful Warriors," a group formed by Shinigami which predated Shibusen. Asura was greatly feared, having destroyed all of the witches of the East by himself. Asura was always fearful, so he became attached to power to protect himself and started taking the souls of people who were not listed. He even went so far as to eat his own weapon partner out of fear, resulting in his madness and transformation into the first kishin. Afterward, Asura`s very existence caused insanity and terror to spread throughout the world. To stop him, Shinigami ripped off Asura`s skin and used it to imprison him under Shibusen, then Shinigami rooted his own body and soul down to prevent him from awakening. Asura is eventually resurrected by Eruka and Free upon Medusa`s orders. Even partially awoken, he knocks out Black Star and Kid in a single blow and battles Shinigami on equal ground. Shinigami`s movements were limited by his connection to Death City, allowing Asura to escape. He flew to an unknown destination to regain his strength, but once again Asura is causing insanity and terror to infect the world.</description>

His weapon form, the guillotine, fits his title of "executioner". Justin has the ability to read lips, but due to his constant usage of earphones and Shinigami wearing a mask, he cannot understand Shinigami. He tends to pray and give thanks to his god, Shinigami, for everything, and also tends to speak loudly due to his constant use of headphones. He travels by means of a dune buggy with a coffin on wheels connected to it. He is coloured with blonde hair and he is wearing an ecclesiastical hat, usually worn by monks from European churches.</description>

An aura was seen coming from her hand, implying that her hand transforms into some sort of smashing weapon. Marie is partnered with Stein since her soul wavelength has a calming effect. This possibly relates to the fact that Frankenstein, on whom Dr. Stein is based, is frequently seen with a hammer, which implies that that is her weapon form. Her last name is derived from the legendary hammer of Thor, Mjöllnir. Her nickname is "Crushing Weapon Marie". She wears an eyepatch with a thunderbolt insignia, leading one to believe that she may use electricity.</description>

She was the student council president when Stein and the other Death Scythes were students, and scolded Spirit, for his endless flirting, and Stein, for his urge to dissect everything. She was said to have been a small, yet talkative child. She still treats the others as little kids like a teacher would (clapping to get their attention and telling them to line up and walk in a single file line) much to the embarrassment of the others. She is suggested to have a genius IQ, and is an extremely competent information gatherer and tactician, easily finding one of Arachnophobia`s labs. In weapon form, she takes the form of a crossbow-like sniper rifle and fires compressed soul wavelength with high accuracy, stating herself she can shoot a target up to 10 km away with only a 1 mm margin of error.</description>

Giriko is not very good at remembering faces, as seen when he does not recognize Maka when she infiltrates into Arachne`s castle with the other Shibusen students. He develops a rivalry with Justin Law, as the two have very conflicting ideas, he also calls Justin "Father" (this is a joke at the fact that Justin dresses like a Catholic priest).
