<description>Galo Sengen ("Galish Man GAL" in English / GAL男宣言 in Japanese) is a 2011 rap music video by the Japanese hip-hop group Policeman.
The animated music video became well-known for its humorous depiction of a Japanese youth culture known as "Gyaruo," which is characterized by the dark tanned skin, dyed blond hair and appreciation for dance music.
In the video, a group of men are satirically portrayed as http://anidb.net/t2475 [Super Saiyans], a type of superfighters from the Japanese manga franchise http://anidb.net/a231 [Dragon Ball], who transcend into the state of "galish" or "gyaru".

<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<description>Anime that imitate other stories (can be from TV, film, books, historical events, ...) for comic effect by exaggerating the style and changing the content of the original. Also known as spoofs. It can also refer to when whole elements of one work are lifted out of their context and reused.</description>

<name>comedy</name>
<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>
