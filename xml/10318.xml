<description>Diancie is the princess of Diamond Ore Country, located deep underground, where the Pokémon Carbink live together in peace. The energy source of this country is a giant diamond called the Sacred Diamond, which can only be created by princess Diancie. However, the current princess does not yet possess the power to create such a diamond, and the current Sacred Diamond`s power is soon going to run out, which would result in the end of the country. Diancie meets up with Ash and Pikachu, and they set off to search for the legendary Pokemon Xerneas, which possesses sacred power. On the way, they find the cocoon where the Destruction Pokémon, Yveltal, who was said to have once destroyed life in Kalos, lies in wait.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<description>Any anime that is based on a role-playing game aka RPG. A role-playing video game is a video game which includes elements of non-electronic role-playing games. The player assumes control of one or several fictional characters (a party) who have joined forces in order to perform quests and overcome a great number of challenges and enemies, usually monsters inspired by fantasy, and, to a lesser extent, science fiction and classic mythology. During the course of the game the characters, or avatars, which are generally defined by quantized characteristics, evolve and improve in that their various attributes increase, as well as by gaining more powerful artefacts.</description>

<description>Venusaur known as the Seed Pokémon, is the final stage in Bulbasaur evolution. The seed finally bloomed into a huge flower, vaguely resembling a Rafflesia. The flower constantly draws in sunlight for nutrition, characterized by vivid colors and a soothing aroma, and power, which is much more substantial in the summer. They are always on the move to absorb more sunlight, though they usually remain quiet and still while absorbing it. After it rains, the aroma is much stronger, which attracts other Pokémon. Female Venusaur have a seed coming out of the flower, possibly representing a pregnancy. Being the final form of Grass starter, Venusaur can learn Hyper Beam, Giga Impact and Frenzy Plant.</description>

<description>Charizard is a dual-type Fire/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Charmeleon starting at level 36. It is the final form of Charmander. It can Mega Evolve into two forms: Mega Charizard X using Charizardite X and Mega Charizard Y using Charizardite Y. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Charizard is the game mascot of Pokémon Red and FireRed Versions.
Charizard is a draconic, bipedal Pokémon. It is primarily orange with a cream underside from the chest to the tip of its tail. It has a long neck, small blue eyes, slightly raised nostrils, and two horn-like structures protruding from the back of its rectangular head. There are two fangs visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is closed. Two large wings with blue-green undersides sprout from its back, and a horn-like appendage juts out from the third joint of each wing. A single wing-finger is visible through the center of each wing membrane. Charizard`s arms are short and skinny compared to its robust belly, and each limb has three white claws. It has stocky legs with cream-colored soles on each of its plantigrade feet. The tip of its long, tapering tail burns with a sizable flame.
Charizard has two Mega Forms. Both feature a shorter snout, white, vertical slit pupils, and a bright underside reaching the lower jaw.
As Mega Charizard X, its body and legs are more physically fit, though its arms remain thin. Its skin turns black with a sky-blue underside and soles. Two spikes with blue tips curve upward from the front and back of each shoulder, while the tips of its horns sharpen, turn blue, and curve slightly upward. Its brow and claws are larger, and its eyes are now red. It has two small, fin-like spikes under each horn and two more down its lower neck. The finger disappears from the wing membrane, and the lower edges are divided into large, rounded points. The third joint of each wing-arm is adorned with a claw-like spike. Mega Charizard X breathes blue flames out the sides of its mouth, and the flame on its tail now burns blue. It is said that its new power turns it black and creates more intense flames.
As Mega Charizard Y, it becomes sleeker in appearance but retains its normal coloration. It has three pointed horns on the back of its head, the middle of which is longer. Its snout has larger fangs and a ridge on the nose. Its neck is shorter, but its torso is thinner and longer. It features longer digitigrade feet. Its hands are less developed, with extremely shortened fingers that are no longer separated from each other. Small wings develop on its wrists, while the ones on its back become larger, lose the wing finger passing through their membrane and end up with ragged edges. The back of its tail has a large spike at the base and three smaller ones near the tip, which now burns with a longer flame. Mega Charizard Y is said to have incredible flying prowess that is greater than a jet fighter.
As Gigantamax Charizard, it becomes larger and physically fit. The lower part of its body glows white with several yellow diamonds located on the lower belly. There are also diamond-shaped spots located on the front legs. The claws located on its hand and feet become longer and sharp. The feet become longer and digitigrade, retaining small glowing soles under the forefeet. The wings are transformed into literal flame wings extending to the shoulder blade and two flames located on the horns. The colossal, flamed wings were created from the energy of Gigantamaxing. The sclera of the eyes becomes yellow. The glow of a flame can be seen in the mouth, and the teeth grow, with the lower front teeth and three teeth in the middle now protruding when the mouth is closed. The flame on the tail extends out and has three red clouds surrounding it. The flames within Gigantamax Charizard burns hotter than 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit. When it roars, the temperature can climb to even higher lengths. The wings are capable of being hotter than magma which Charizard uses to burn its opponents.
Charizard flies in search of powerful opponents to battle, and its fire will burn hotter as it gains experience. Its fiery breath is capable of melting boulders, massive glaciers, and has been known to accidentally cause forest fires. In the past, Blast Burn was its signature move. Charizard typically inhabit mountains and valleys, such as the Charicific Valley in Johto. The anime has shown that only a weak Charizard would show off its power. It also showed that Charizard can swim underwater, with Pokémon Origins further showing that the flame on the tip of the tail can still keep burning underwater. The wings of Charizard can carry to an altitude of 4,600 feet.
Charizard is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Wildfire.</description>

<description>Blastoise known as the Shellfish Pokémon, is the fully grown and developed form of the Squirtle species evolution line. In the main Pokémon game series, a Blastoise is only acquired when a Wartortle grows past experience level 36 and evolves into a Blastoise. As a Blastoise, two sections of the hefty shell open up to reveal cannon-like spouts on the Pokémon`s back that can fire pressurized water at a target with enough force that even concrete walls and thick steel can be punctured. The spouts are also very accurate, since a Blastoise can strike distant tin cans with the water from its spouts!</description>

<description>Spearow is a small, bird Pokémon with short wings and a small, stubby beak. It is noted for being frail, but it makes up for that with its "Mirror Move" ability. It eats insects in grassy areas by flushing them out with its wings, and plucking at them with its beak. Its wings aren`t good for long distance travel or high flying, but it is able to fly at high speeds by flapping its wings very rapidly. It is very territorial, constantly buzzing about and calling with a loud cry that can be heard from half a mile away. It serves to scare away predators and keep in touch with other Spearow, which usually is used to alert them of danger. The golden spearow has golden wings and a golden beak, it also has a lighter color of brown feathers.</description>

<description>Sandshrew are a species of brick-skinned mouse-like Pokémon found in several regions throughout the Pokémon world. Despite its name, Sandshrew`s appearance borrows more from the armadillo or the pangolin than from the shrew; its primary means of defense when threatened is to instantly curl up its body into a ball, leaving only its tough skin exposed. When it is rolled up like this, Sandshrew has the potential to withstand many attacks, as well as being dropped from a great height (also similar to hedgehogs). Sandshrew`s natural environment is deep underground in arid, sandy locations with very little moisture, such as a desert. It chooses this habitat to keep its hide as dry and tough as possible, while the sand also provides it with good camouflage.
In keeping with its physical characteristics, Sandshrew has high Defense in the video games, but low Speed. From Ruby and Sapphire onwards, it has the ability Sand Veil, which increases its evasion during a sandstorm. Sandshrew also appears in the spin-off game Pokémon Snap.
A Sandshrew owned by A.J. is featured in the eighth anime episode, "The Path to the Pokémon League." It had many notable traits, such as the ability to withstand water and its knowledge of Fissure, which it used to dispatch Team Rocket.</description>

<description>Sandslash are a larger and stronger form that Sandshrew take when they gain enough experience to reach level 22. Generally they are a moderately large, bipedal hedgehog or pangolin-like creature with hard yellow skin, lengthy claws, and a back loaded with an assemblage of large brown spikes. These spikes are hardened sections of Sandslash`s hide that grow to form a natural self-defense when Sandslash curls into a ball. Each spike remains on Sandslash for one year, after which it falls off and a new spike grows in its place. Sandslash can be found in desert areas, particularly close to dry forests. Sandslash`s spikes serve a number of purposes to help cope with its environment, such as providing shade to protect it from the sun and heatstroke or using them offensively to harm both predators and prey. It uses its claws to climb trees, cut up food and dig, the latter being an activity that can cause them to break if done too quickly. It cannot run very quickly, but it is very quick with its claws.</description>

<description>Oddish are a weed-like Pokémon found in all regions throughout the Pokémon world. (with the exception of Pokémon Blue and Pokémon Leaf Green) Oddish looks like a small animated onion/turnip plant with a rounded body. Its body is blue or purple with two small feet and red eyes. On top of its head grows a large clump of 5 long green blades of grass. Its name likely came from the words "odd" and "radish".
Oddish is a nocturnal Pokémon, using moonlight rather than the sun`s rays for photosynthesis. During the day, Oddish avoids the sun`s heat and brightness by burying itself into the earth, leaving only the leaves on top of its head visible above ground. In this way it disguises itself as a plant, misdirecting its carnivorous diurnal predators.
While buried, Oddish nourishes itself by absorbing nutrients from the soil using its feet, which are said to temporarily change into a root-like structure for this purpose.
Oddish has been known to use its leaves as hands, such as one who used this to climb a rope net and tried to fly like a Hoppip.
If anyone pulls at Oddish`s leaves and tries to uproot it while it is buried underground, Oddish will react by shrieking in a cute, high-pitched voice. This mirrors the behavior of the legendary mandrake in a similar situation, although it seems that Oddish`s squeaks do not have the same dire consequences as a mandrake`s.</description>

<description>Tentacool (メノクラゲ, Menokurage?) is an aquatic Pokémon based on the box jellyfish. It drifts aimlessly wherever the ocean currents take it, sometimes ending up in shallow waters where it may be accidentally caught in fishing lines. Tentacool may also end up stuck on beaches when low tide comes; since its body is largely composed of water, it will shrivel up, risking death from dehydration if it stays out of the sea for too long. Tentacool has two main weapons. At the tips of its tentacles are toxic feelers, which it uses to stab anything it touches with stinging acid. Due to its excellent camouflage in the water, Tentacool can often remain undetected by swimmers right up to the moment it stings them. Tentacool`s gelatinous, watery body can also absorb sunlight and refract it within, producing beam energy it shoots from its crystal-like eyes.
Tentacool is available in all Pokémon games to date. It is extremely common, especially while surfing on sea routes, and is in almost every single body of water.
In the anime, Tentacool was featured in the episode "Tentacool and Tentacruel" in which a raging mob of the titular Pokémon attacked the Porta Vista resort. The episode was banned after the attacks on September 11, 2001 due to its scenes depicting Tentacools and Tentacruels destroying buildings at a seaside resort.</description>

<description>"Tentacruel" is probably a portmanteau of "tentacle", the reason for which is obvious, and the adjective "cruel", referring to its personality. The name may have something to do with the deep-sea jellyfish called Tentaculata. Its name was originally going to be Man-O-War, which refers to the Portuguese man o` war. The Japanese name, "Dokukurage," is a portmanteau, of 毒 doku (poison) and 水母 kurage (jellyfish). It resembles its pre-evolution Tentacool to a small degree - the "head" of Tentacool has now been made into a hat-like shape on top of a black orb containing its eyes and two very large hooks which resembles a long nose. Also, unlike Tentacool, it has up to 80 tentacles, most of which are hidden, leaving up to 14 exposed.</description>

<description>Farfetch`d is a dual-type Normal/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
In Galar, Farfetch`d has a Fighting-type regional form. Galarian Farfetch`d evolves into Sirfetch`d after landing three critical hits in a single battle, regardless of if it faints.
Farfetch`d is an avian Pokémon that resembles a light brown duck with a white underbelly. It has a flat, yellow beak, brown eyes, a V-shaped black marking on its forehead similar to a unibrow, and a three-feather crest on top of its head. Its wings are as big as its body and appear to be prehensile enough to substitute for hands. It has yellow legs with webbed feet and a stubby tail.
Farfetch`d is always seen carrying a leek stalk or spring onion. It carries this sprig in its wings, but sometimes chooses to hold it in its beak or feet instead. Unable to live without its stick, Farfetch`d will defend the stalk with its life. Losing it can leave Farfetch`d defenseless. Known uses for the stick include use as a weapon, nesting material, and emergency food source. It is selective about which sticks it will use and has been known to fight over good ones. Farfetch`d is found in temperate grasslands.
Galarian Farfetch`d is a deeper shade of brown, with a more prominent black mark on its head. As the leeks in Galar are much larger than those elsewhere, it carries its leek over its wing in order to better manage its heavy weight. It is renowned for its courage in battle.
Farfetch`d and its evolution Sirfetch`d are the only Pokémon capable of using the Leek item.</description>

<description>Rhyhorn is a rhinoceros like Pokemon with a rock like hide consisting of plates. Ryhorn stands on all four legs and evolves into Rhydon. Rhyhorn is a portmanteau of rhinoceros (which it resembles) and horn. Its spelling is also influenced by the rock rhyolite. Its Japanese name is a portmanteau of sai (犀), meaning rhinoceros and horn (ホーン). Rhyhorn are easily angered and will not hesitate to charge at what ever or who ever angered it. Rhyhorn are powerful enough to topple buildings with their tackle. Rhyhorn are prime examples of "more brawn than brains", as they often charge head first into things but forget why. In Gold, Silver, and Crystal, Brock uses a Rhyhorn to battle. There is also a Rhyhorn in the Brock Gym Leader set of the trading card game.</description>

<description>"Gold-" refers to the fact that it resembles a goldfish. The "-een" is most likely "queen," but it is possible that it is a simple feminine suffix (misspelling of "-ine"). The Japanese name plays on tosakin (土佐金), which is a kind of goldfish. In the original Beta version, it was known as Goldy. Goldeen evolves into Seaking at lvl33.It is considered to be one of the most beautiful Pokémon in the world. Its sharp horn can do serious damage, but it can`t fight on land.
Misty owns a Goldeen that is not really used for battles, but to look for things underwater.</description>

<description>Seaking is a goldfish Pokemon. The "sea" in Seaking`s name refers to the fact that it is a water-inhabiting Pokemon. "King" is probably a reference to its unevolved form`s name, Goldeen (a portmanteau of "gold" and "queen"). Hence, its name means "king of the sea." Its Japanese name refers to Azumanishiki (東錦) for one kind of "goldfish" and Ou (王) for "king". Seaking was originally called Neptune in the beta. Seaking is a goldfish Pokemon with a sharp horn, much like a narwhal. It uses the horn for boring holes in a rock for its nest. In spawning season, they can be seen swimming up rivers and streams.</description>

<description>Magikarp is a commonly found Pokémon that can survive in rivers, lakes,and oceans. Despite its adaptability, the Pokédex states that the Magikarp species has grown weaker over time, and it is one of the least viable for battling in the series. It eventually evolves into another, far more powerful Pokémon, Gyarados.
Magikarp is commonly thought of as the weakest Pokémon. They are only able to learn three moves: Splash (does absolutely nothing), Tackle (a weak attack), and Flail (which does more damage as Magikarp is more damaged.)
In the anime, Magikarp has appeared several times, most notably as the subject of a running gag in which a salesman attempts to trick Team Rocket into buying Magikarp in various guises. (This man also appears in Pokémon Red, Blue, Yellow, FireRed, and LeafGreen.) Team Rocket later adopted a Magikarp-shaped submarine.
Magikarp also appear many times in the video games. They can be found in almost any pond, river, lake, or sea. Many trainers have them, along with other weak Water Pokémon like Goldeen or Horsea. In Pokémon Pearl, one trainer named "Ander," found outside Lake Valor, possesses a Magikarp whose move "Quake" replaces the normal Magikarp`s equally useless "Splash".</description>

<description>Eevee is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves into one of eight different Pokémon through various methods. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Eevee is the game mascot and starter Pokémon in Pokémon: Let`s Go, Eevee!, as well as for the main characters of Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness and Pokémon Conquest. It is also the rival`s starter Pokémon in Pokémon Yellow, although Professor Oak originally intended to give it to the player.
Eevee is a mammalian, quadruped Pokémon with primarily brown fur. The tip of its bushy tail and its large furry collar are cream-colored. It has short, slender legs with three small toes and a pink paw pad on each foot. Eevee has brown eyes, long pointed ears with dark brown interiors, and a small black nose. Eevee is rarely found in the wild and is mostly only found in cities and towns. However, Eevee is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure that is easily influenced by its environment. This allows it to adapt to a variety of habitats by evolving. Eevee is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Extreme Evoboost.
In Pokémon: Let`s Go, Eevee!, the player starts with a special Eevee known as a Partner Eevee. The Partner Eevee has purple eyes and a lighter shade of fur. These design elements likely taken from the anime, which implemented similar traits starting in the Advanced Generation series. The marking on the tip of a female Partner Eevee is heart-shaped. Before Pokémon Sword and Shield, this trait was unique and wasn`t found on other female Eevee. Partner Eevee has higher base stats and access to moves that normal Eevee do not. Partner Eevee is the only Pokémon capable of performing Bouncy Bubble, Buzzy Buzz, Sizzly Slide, Glitzy Glow, Baddy Bad, Sappy Seed, Freezy Frost, Sparkly Swirl, and the Partner Power, Veevee Volley. In Pokémon Sword and Shield, the unique pattern is present on all female Eevee as a true gender difference.
As Gigantamax Eevee, it has become larger and more fluffy. The fur collar becomes longer with several triangular furs pointing straight up. The right ear has three red clouds surrounding it like a circle. Due to the fur becoming fluffier and luxurious, any enemies caught in it will lose the will to fight due to being enamored by its presence. Due to Gigantamaxing, Eevee becomes even more playful and rambunctious, desiring to play with its opponent and often unintentionally crushing them with its size.
Gigantamax Eevee is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Cuddle.</description>

<description>Furret live in colonies with tunnels much too small for normal Pokemon to traverse, yet it is a perfect fit for the slim build of Furret as it hides from the outside world at the surface by traversing through these tunnels like gophers. These tunnel colonies become very complex, especially if they are very deep, and can potentially stretch for miles. Occasionally, these colonies are found intertwined with Diglett colonies. The Furret evolves from Sentret at level 15.
Furret`s rudimentary paws and legs are deceptively nimble, making Furret a quick, unpredictable predator especially skillful at hunting Rattata, its main prey. Also, the fur of the Pokemon is thicker than it appears, and Furret can fluff up its fur to make itself look much stronger and larger than it actually is as an intimidation tactic towards potential foes.
Furret is based on a ferret or squirrel.</description>

<description>Noctowl is the second owl Pokémon, being the evolution of Hoothoot. It is a large bird whose plumage is colored in various shades of brown. Its round head has two piercing, red eyes and two large "eyebrows". These eyebrows help balance Noctowl while it is flying to increase its aerodynamics. When hunting, Noctowl puts its prodigious eyesight to good use to hunt down prey without fail. It is also very good at sneaking up to its victims unnoticed thanks to its supple, soft-feathered wings that allow it to fly without making any noise. When a Noctowl needs to ponder especially deep thoughts, it can rotate its head 180 degrees, which serves to increase its intellectual faculties.
In the anime, a shiny Noctowl has been part of Ash`s team during his travels in Johto. Ash frequently used his Noctowl to explore an area from the sky, or to puncture Team Rocket`s hot-air balloon. Ash used it in many battles throughout Johto, but it is currently living in Professor Oak`s lab since Ash decided to make a fresh start and leave all of his Pokémon except for Pikachu when he left for Hoenn.</description>

<description>Ampharos are powerful, bipedal creatures, after gaining the ability to stand upright full-time upon evolution from Flaaffy. Its sleek yellow body is marked with black rings around its neck, and tail. It has black markings along its horns as well as the orbs on its body. Ampharos has powerful light abilities, its main light sources being the large orbs on its tail and head, and because of this is often used as a beacon in lighthouses, and mythical legend says that these lights can even be seen from outer space. Before the introduction of modern technology, Ampharos` light was used to communicate between long distances, in much a similar way to smoke signals.</description>

<description>Marill is an aquatic mouse Pokémon. Marill`s tail floats like a buoy because it is filled with oil, which is less dense than water. When fishing at a fast-running stream, Marill wraps its tail around a tree. Since the tail is stretchy and flexible, it allows the Pokémon to get food and still stay safely anchored. Otherwise, when in a lake, it uses the buoy-qualities of its tail to keep itself suspended as the rest of its body dives underwater to feed on aquatic plants. Its fur is impermeable, which keeps it dry, and that allows it to swim through water at high speed without being slowed by the water`s resistance.
In the Pokémon Anime, Tracey, the Pokémon Observer from the Orange Islands, has a Marill which he uses on multiple occasions.</description>

<description>Azumarill is the evolved form of Marill. Azumarill resembles a blue, bipedal rabbit with a large, ellipsoid body, long blue ears with red insides, and a blue ball on the end of its thin, elastic black tail. The white bubble-like pattern on its lower stomach helps it to camouflage itself from potential predators when it is in the water.
Azumarill`s long ears act as sensors to identify sounds even in fast running rivers. Otherwise, when alone, Azumarill plays in water as a natural pastime, though it must roll up its elongated ears to prevent the sensitive sensory materials inside them from getting wet. The ball at the end of its tail can act as a sensor and guide it while under water. It can make thick, liquid balloons out of thin air with the saliva-water stored in its body. If it spots a drowning Pokémon in any body of water, it fashions such air balloons and jumps in to give the troubled Pokémon air balloons to help it breathe.
In the Pokémon anime, Paul owned an Azumarill which he used in a gym battle against Roark. Although it knew powerful Water attacks like Hydro Pump, it lost to Roark`s Geodude, which prompted Paul to give it to a Pokémon trainer passing by, being disappointed by its strength.</description>

<description>Hoppip are small, spherical creatures, with long leaves protruding from their head. They have small, gripping feet and ears disproportionate to their body, used to listen for winds. Hoppip have extremely petite and almost weightless bodies, and are susceptible to strong winds due to this. When a Hoppip feels a gale approaching, it will lock the leaves on its head with the leaves of other Hoppip, in an attempt to avoid being blown away. If a Hoppip is by itself when in heavy winds, it may grip the ground with its feet to prevent this. Despite the dangers Hoppip face in strong winds, they enjoy gentle breezes and can float in the calmest of winds, which can carry them across vast distances.</description>

They take advantage of their light weight and fluffy, buoyant cotton balls to take to the skies. They are very adept at catching the warm southern winds and navigating their way to any location in the world, typically overseas and until they encounter a cold air current, whereupon they will begin landing. While floating, Jumpluff release spores that propagate its offspring around the world. This method of reproduction is reminiscent of dandelions.</description>

Their simplistic face consists of mainly of a large mouth, primarily while open. They have purplish barbed antennae on the sides of their head. Three purple, though sometimes shaded blue or pink, gills are on its stomach. Wooper will usually live in cold water: however, they occasionally come out onto land in search of food. When doing so, they coat their bodies with slimy, poisonous film. Touching the slime with bare hands will cause a shooting pain. Male Wooper have two barbs on their antennae, while female Wooper have one barb. Males also have larger gills.</description>

<description>Murkrow is a small black crow with red eyes. The top of its head is styled as a witch`s hat and its tail bristles out like a broomstick. Murkrow is rather unpopular in the Pokémon world. Its dismal appearance and nocturnal nature have long caused it to be considered an omen of ill fortune to all who see it. If a Murkrow finds itself wounded, it fights back by leading its pursuer to dark mountain trails in an attempt to get him hopelessly lost in the darkness.
Murkrow is also attracted to bright, shiny objects, which it collects to stash in its nest. This, of course, leads to many arguments between Murkrow and Meowth, who both share a common love of stashing things - and taking from each other! It does not hesitate to steal such objects if necessary and has even been known to attempt to snatch rings off their owner`s fingers (and complete strangers too, for that matter). With the addition of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, it is revealed that some Murkrow are servants to its evolved form, Honchkrow, who spends all of its time preening and ordering the Murkrow around. Also with Diamond and Pearl`s release, Murkrow, like many other Pokémon, have gender differences. In this case, Males have a taller "hat" - technically, the crest that resembles a three-pointed witch hat - than females would. Murkrow can only be found wild in the Pokémon Diamond Version in Eterna Forest, while Misdreavus can only be found in Pokémon Pearl at the same location.</description>

<description>Ursaring is a large (although arboreal) bear with a yellow ring on its stomach. Ursaring eats food obtained from digging deep underground as well as berries from trees. Ursaring can hibernate through an entire winter without any food. Ursaring`s sense of smell is among the most developed of all Pokémon; it can detect subtle differences in scents. For this reason, Ursaring is sometimes used by police in the Pokémon universe, both as a strong enforcer, and as an explosive-sniffing Pokémon. If criminals are hiding in trees, it can use its claws to cut down the tree.
Its Japanese name, "Ringuma", originates from "ring" (ringu) and "bear" (kuma). In the anime, Ursaring is caught by Paul, after it is angered by Turtwig.</description>

<description>Remoraid is a Remora-based suckerfish that scavenges for food and has a somewhat symbiotic relationship with Mantine. Remoraid will attach itself to the underbelly of Mantine with its dorsal fin, eating scraps of food that Mantine drops as well as the parasites on them that causes them to itch. In return, the Mantine helps defend the Remoraid from enemies. When not scavenging for food, Remoraid will strike down its own prey with precise accuracy using fast streams of airborne water, which Remoraid shoots from its mouth using abdominal muscles. Remoraid can move faster through the water by blasting water from its mouth in the opposite direction of where it intends to move.</description>

<description>Delibird resembles the rockhopper penguin, or possibly a snowy owl. It has red and white plumage and is always pictured carrying a sack with it, giving it a Santa Claus-like impression, although its "sack" is actually a long wavery tail, like a ribbon. Delibird is said to make its home at the edge of steep cliffs. It spends all day searching for food, which it stores in its sack/tail and brings back to its chicks. Delibird are known to save the lives of many lost and starved mountaineers by sharing their food with them.
On the other hand, a Delibird under attack will fling its stored food at the opponent as a projectile weapon. This is perhaps the basis for its signature attack, Present, which is an attack only Delibird can learn, as well as the only attack Delibird can learn naturally (through leveling up). In the video games, Delibird is a relatively rare Pokémon; it appears in icy caves, during swarms in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, and as a Shadow Pokémon in Pokémon Colosseum. Delibird can also be caught in Icefall Cave on Four Island of the Sevii Islands, only in Fire Red.
Delibird`s anime debut was in the episode "Dues and Don`ts," in which a Delibird belonging to Team Rocket follows Jessie, James, and Meowth around under orders to collect the enormous debt the three have amassed during the years with constant requests for Pokémon-shaped mechas and other devices. This Delibird appears in several episodes in the series set in Johto. Another Delibird, a helper of Santa Claus, appeared in "Delibird`s Present," an episode of the Pikachu`s Winter Vacation 3 holiday special also shown as part of Pokémon Chronicles.</description>

<description>Smeargle is the painter of the Pokémon world, best known for its unique "Sketch" attack. It has a long tail that ends in a tuft of fur similar to a paintbrush. The tuft is continuously soaked by a special fluid secreted from the tip of the tail. The color of the fluid is predetermined for each Smeargle. The fluid is used to mark the boundaries of its territory and print its footprints on the backs of its fellows once they reach maturity. Over 5,000 distinctive marks left by the species have been found in the Pokémon world.
Smeargle has its "Sketch" technique, which is unique to Smeargle. When used, it will replace itself permanently with the last attack technique used by an opponent Pokémon against Smeargle. It learns Sketch every ten levels. There are a few attacks Sketch cannot copy, (Such as Chatots main attack Chatter) but it can learn nearly every attack in the game.</description>

<description>Zigzagoon is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation III.
It evolves into Linoone starting at level 20.
In Galar, Zigzagoon has a Dark/Normal-type regional form. It evolves into Galarian Linoone starting at level 20, which evolves into Obstagoon when leveled up at night starting at level 35.
Zigzagoon is a raccoon-like, quadruped Pokémon with bristly, zigzag-patterned fur. It has stripes formed by alternating layers of cream and brown fur. It has a brown head with spiky ears and a black nose. A black, mask pattern surrounds its brown eyes. The upper half of its mouth is jagged, and when it is open, there are two pointed teeth in its lower jaw. Its feet have three claws and pink paw pads. Its forefeet are cream-colored, but the hind feet are brown. Its brush tail is spiky and bristly.
In Galar, the oldest and original form of Zigzagoon have a more black and white patterned-fur. The red eyes are surrounded by a black spiked mask. The black feet contains three sharp white claws. It has a long pink tongue that is constantly standing outside of mouth with two lower teeth in between.
Zigzagoon is abundantly curious, as it wanders restlessly back and forth while rubbing its nose to the ground in search of something. It rubs its bristly back hair against trees to mark its territory, and plays dead to fool opponents in battle. Zigzagoon is found commonly in grassy fields. The Zigzagoon in Galar are known to be constantly on the move and never settling down. It is believed that the zigzag movements of the Zigzagoon from other regions originated from its Galar relatives. They enjoy battling to the point they often attempt to prove others into fighting it. While this succeeded with other Pokémon, humans instead mistaken it wanting affection, much to the Zigzagoon`s frustrations.</description>

In Galar, Linoone has a Dark/Normal-type regional form. It evolves from Galarian Zigzagoon starting at level 20 and evolves into Obstagoon when leveled up at night starting at level 35.
Linoone is a slender-bodied, quadruped Pokémon. Most of its fur is white, but it has several brown stripes. One long stripe stretches the length of its body before ending in an arrowhead shape on its forehead. The are additional stripes on each side of its bushy tail and on its cheeks. It has sharp, elongated claws and small pointed teeth. It has small, tuft-like ears, long cheek fur, and blue eyes.
Linoone can run up to 60 miles per hour, but has to stop before it can make a turn. It often fails to catch prey due to only being able to run in a straight line. When it sees prey underwater in ponds, it leaps in and uses its sharp claws to catch the prey. As shown in the anime, Linoone has an attraction to anything round, and will grab any orb-shaped object it sees if given the chance. It often carries a snatched object in its expandable cheek pouches and deposits it in any of a number of secret stashes it keep on its territory. Linoone tends to live in grasslands.
In Galar, Linoone has a black and white color scheme due to harsh environment in the region among with competition. This allows its survival instinct to improve, leading to the ability to evolve into Obstagoon. Its eyes are red while covered with a stripe shaped like a shooting star. It has longer claws with grey fur surrounding the front feet. It also has sharp teeth on the upper mouth with a long red tongue sticking out.
Galarian Linoone are know to be rash and fearless. It prefers recklessly challenging opponents that are stronger than itself. Linoone is known to use its long tongue to taunt opponents. Once the foe is fully enraged, Linoone will hurl itself at the opponent, tackling them by force. These traits make Galarian Linoone very popular among unhappy and angry youths in Galar, who have nowhere to take out their anger and frustrations on. By charging at up to 60 miles per hour, it can deliver powerful Tackles and Headbutts with enough destructive force to even knock away a car. Linoone can be thrown off balance should it miss, however.</description>

It migrates to other lands in search of warmth, flying over 180 miles a day on some occasions. It will courageously stand their ground against foes, taking on Pokémon like Skarmory with an equal footing. This gutsy Pokémon will remain defiant even after a loss. This however is in stark contrast to when it becomes hungry; it cries loudly. As a result of its relative youth, it sometimes becomes lonely and cries at night. It feeds on Wurmple that live in forests.
In the Pokémon anime, main trainer Ash Ketchum caught one and used it throughout the third-generation story arc, during which it evolved into a Swellow.</description>

If the trainer is cheerful and happy, Kirlia will also be happy, and will spin and dance. The happier the trainer is, the more beautiful Kirlia will become. Likewise, a heartless trainer will result in a weak and saddened Kirlia, and its powers will have decreased significantly.</description>

With huge mouths these Pokémon can eat massive amounts of undersea food, such as krill, in a single gulp. When chasing somewhat larger prey, Wailord herd them by leaping out of the water and making humongous splashes in what is often described as a breathtaking display. If a Wailord inhales to the maximum capacity of its gigantic lungs, it is able to dive close to 10,000 feet below the surface. Optionally by puffing itself up, it can float high on the ocean surface or beach on a shoreline if it wishes.</description>

<description>Buizel is a sea weasel Pokémon that uses a flotation sac that acts as an inflatable collar in order to float on the top of the water. When it dives, its sac deflates and it uses its forked tail to swim by rotating it like a screw. Males have two spots on their back, while females only have one.
In the anime, Dawn captures a renegade Buizel in the episode "Buizel Your Way Out of This." She later trades him to Ash for his Aipom. Later on in the the series Buizel is involved in an epic battle with a Lucario between Ash and Maylene at the Veilstone Gym and also learns the attack move Water Pulse.</description>

<description>Chatot can learn and speak human words (known as Chatter). The ability to learn human words is rare. It may or may not be able to comprehend what it is actually saying though, much like real parrots. If they gather, they all learn the same saying. It can also mimic sounds. When a Chatot learns its signature move Chatter, the trainer can record a custom call from the game menu. The sound is garbled to avoid the recording of obscenities. The player can trade this Pokemon for a Buizel in Eterna City.
Its head is shaped like a musical note and its tail like a metronome. Its body is covered with many multi-colored feathers giving it a resemblance to a black masked lovebird. Chatot can only be caught in the morning or during the day.
Chatot also appears in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time/Darkness as the second in command to Guildmaster Wigglytuff.</description>

<description>Jessie is one half of of the Team Rocket duo that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokemon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
Jessie`s mother, Miyamoto, was a high-ranking Team Rocket agent. When Jessie was around the age of three, Miyamoto left on a mission to the Andes Mountains to record the voice of the elusive Pokemon Mew. However, Miyamoto disappeared, and Jessie was put into a foster home which had very little money. There were times when she had no choice but to eat snow because of a lack of more nourishing food.
When she was old enough, she left home to become a Pokemon nurse in Jouto. However, the school she was enrolled in was literally for Pokemon nurses (i.e. Chansey), so she failed to graduate and left, leaving behind a Chansey she had befriended there. It is assumed that she then traveled back to Kanto, where she enrolled in Pokemon Tech, a trainer`s school, met James, and subsequently failed and dropped out. After this, Jessie and James joined a bicycle gang in Sunny Town, where Jessie was known for swinging a chain above her head as she rode her bike (nicknamed "Chainer Jess").
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between Jessie and James after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Sometime before joining Team Rocket, and it is not known when, Jessie obtained a Contest Pass in the Hoenn region. Also during the years before Team Rocket, she had several boyfriends, all of whom left her and/or treated her badly. In "Xatu the Future", she revealed that she had once worked at a T.V. station as the Weathergirl. In "From Cradle to Save" is also revealed that she once was a ninja.
She has a long-standing bitter rivalry with Cassidy, another member of Team Rocket. Another member, Wendy, held a grudge against Jessie for failing to pay for a drink (making Wendy pay), but got her revenge when she added the charge to Jessie`s overall Team Rocket bill.
In the episode "Ignorance is Blissey", Jessie was reunited with her friend Chansey from the Pokemon nurse school; Chansey had since evolved into a Blissey.
Starting in Hoenn, Jessie has become a Pokemon Coordinator, entering every contest that she could. She frequently makes it to the battle round, but usually loses there. However, in "Borrowing on Bad Faith", she finally succeeded in winning an (unofficial) contest by using Ash`s Aipom, which she had saved earlier in the episode. And, in "Team Shocker!", she finally wins an official contest with her Dustox in at Solaceon City. Later she also won a ribbon with help of her Yanmega. She has Contest Passes to compete in the Hoenn, Kanto, and Sinnoh regions.
While Jessie`s role in the Pokemon anime has not yet ended, in Toshihiro Ono`s manga, "The Electric Tale of Pikachu", she ended up married to James and with child.
Jessie seems to have a special preference for snake-like Pokemon, owning both an Arbok and a Seviper. In "The Ninja Poke Showdown", she expressed a preference for Poison-type Pokemon in general.
For unknown reasons, she, James and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation.
In the Kanto contests, Jessie disguises herself as Jessebella (which is similar to James former fiancee Jessiebelle) wearing a red dress and glasses. Eventually, Ash, Brock, Max and May finds out her true identity at the last contest.
During the Kanto Grand Festival, Jessie dresses up as Jessadia (Japanese: キャンディ・ムサリーナ Candy Musalina). and wears glasses, long white socks, a yellow and orange dress, and has her hair in pigtails. She works there as an announcer and Lilian Meridian`s assistant; Lilian herself says she may not really like "Jessadia"`s style, but recognizes her talent. In the Latin American dub, she enters Super Contests under the name Jessiebella (referencing Jessiebelle again). Jessie currently still continues to use the Jessalina disguise while participating in Super Contests.
In "Pruning a Passel of Pals!" and "Strategy With a Smile!" she once again used her Jessadia disguise to report on the Wallace Cup.
Although Jessie had entered mostly every contest in Hoenn &amp; Kanto, she lost in every single one, whether it was the first match of the Battle Rounds or the finals. But in the Sinnoh Region, she has so far won 2 ribbons using her Dustox and Yanmega.</description>

<description>Meowth is a very unique Pokémon as it has many of the characteristics of a human. It walks on two feet, talks and is as smart as any human. Meowth is currently a member of Team Rocket and he travels around with Jessie and James trying to capture Pikachu and other rare Pokémon for Giovanni.
Meowth generally finishes his sentences with "Nyaa (ニャー)" which is the equivalent of "meow" in English. This helps people remember that despite his ability to talk like a human, he still has cat character traits.
Meowth is also known for coming up with his many schemes to try to capture Pikachu. While Jessie and James always agree with Meowth and think his plans are brilliant, they are generally foiled by Ash and his friends.
Long Con to Access Raimon City Pokémon Center
Meowth schemed with Jessie, James and Doctor Zager to figure out a way for them to infiltrate the Raimon City Pokémon Center where high-leveled Pokémon are stored in a vault that is protected by a security machine scan system that would only open if Nurse Joy (Isshu) or Nurse Joy`s Audino were scanned. Meowth pretended to be no longer part of Team Rocket making up a story that his made an error while executing a certain operation and when headquarters hear of his mistake, they told him he was fired.
Ash, Iris and Cilan believed him and allowed Meowth to travel with him. Pikachu though didn`t trust Meowth even though Meowth proved on numerous occasion that it should be trusted. Meowth`s plan was put into action when they arrived at the Raimon City Pokémon Center and as soon as Nurse Joy`s Audino was scanned to open the door, Meowth turned on Pikachu and the other and captured all the Pokémon in the vault. The long con had been a success and Meowth met up with Jessie and James below the Pokémon Center. Unfortunately, they weren`t able to get away as Ash and his friends realized that Meowth had just been conning them and they were able to stop Team Rocket.</description>

<description>James is one part of of the Team Rocket trio that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokémon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
James is mostly a comedic parody of bishounen characters; the English dub in particular tends to give him a melodramatic and even campy tone. He is somewhat famous for carrying a rose, though in more recent episodes he does not display it often. Mostly, his rose is displayed in the Team Rocket motto.
The only child of millionaires, James was forced to endure formal society. At a young age, he was forcefully engaged to a girl of whom he was terrified, Jessiebelle, all because his parents wanted to have a wealthy daughter-in-law. Thus, he ran away from home, leaving behind his beloved pet Growlie. He attempted to enroll in Pokémon Tech, a trainer`s school, but, along with his new friend Jessie, flunked out. Then, with Jessie, he joined the Sunny Town bicycle gang, where he was popular for being the only gang member to have to use training wheels (nicknamed "Trainer Jim"). Eventually James, Jessie, and the bike gang went their separate ways.
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between James and Jessie after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Since he is proficient in several activities, including Pokémon haiku and PokéRinger, it is possible that he developed his skills during his temporary separation from Jessie, but this is not known for sure.
In the episode "Holy Matrimony!", James returned to his home as a result of a trap by his parents, who pretended to be dead. He was reunited with his old pet Growlie and managed to avoid marrying Jessiebelle. Growlie stayed behind when James returned to Jessie and Meowth.
James has a tendency to be swindled by a Magikarp Salesman, who has on many occasions tricked him into buying a Magikarp or other useless Pokémon and items for large sums of money.
James also has a tendency to cross-dress, but has not done it since "Pros and Con Artists". He does, however, dress up like famous celebrities as well, such as Professor Oak, Juan, and Norman.
James loves rare bottle caps and has an impressive collection of them. In the episode "All That Glitters!" it is revealed that he has "drunk enough soda pop to float an aircraft carrier".
For unknown reasons, he, Jessie and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation. However in newer episodes the balloon is shown with `jets` attached to explain how they get from one place to another faster than walking.</description>

<description>The Beginning
Ash is the main character of the Pokémon anime. Raised in Pallet Town, he started his journey to become a Pokémon Master at the age of 10. On the day that he started his journey, Ash carelessly woke up late despite being told by his mother, Delia Ketchum to get to bed. He rushed to Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory only to find out that the beginner Pokémon - Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander - had already been given out to trainers who arrived on time. However, Professor Samual Oak mentioned that there was one more Pokémon available - Pikachu. Despite constantly hitting Ash with Electric-type attacks and refusing to return to its PokéBall, Ash decided to take Pikachu along with him on his journey to become a Pokémon Master. Pikachu is cold towards Ash at first and laughs at his failures; however, when Ash saves Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow, he begins to warm up to his new trainer and the two finally become friends. After the battle with the flock of Spearow, a Ho-Oh is seen flying towards a rainbow in the sky. The PokéDex reveals that the Ho-Oh is an unidentified Pokémon. Thus, the journey of Ash and Pikachu begins.
Captures in Viridian Forest
While making his way towards Pewter City and his first Kanto League Gym Battle, Ash came upon a wild Caterpie deep within Viridian Forest. Instead of using Pikachu to battle against the wild Pokémon, Ash took his chances and threw a PokéBall without weakining the Caterpie first. Luckily, he was able to catch the Pokémon without any trouble. The capture of Ash`s Caterpie marked Ash`s first capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Caterpie the second Pokémon to join his team.
The next day, while continuing the trek through the Viridian Forest, Ash came up on a wild Pidgeotto. He tried to just throw a PokéBall like he did with Ash`s Caterpie, but Pidgeotto swatted the PokéBall away. Misty informed that he must weaken the Pokémon first before attempting to capture it. He called out Ash`s Caterpie to battle against, but Misty quickly informed him that Bug-type Pokémon are weak against Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeotto. After Pidgeotto dealt significant damage to Ash`s Caterpie, Ash recalled it and sent out Pikachu. Pikachu was able to use its Thundershock to weaken Pidgeotto and allow Ash to capture it with a PokéBall. Thus, this capture marked Ash`s second capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Pidgeotto the third Pokémon to join his team.
Later on, while still in the Viridian Forest, Ash was approached by Team Rocket, who attempted to steal his Pokémon. After defeating Meowth, James`s Koffing, and Jessie`s Ekans, Ash`s Caterpie evolved into Ash`s Metapod.
Some of Ash`s greatest accomplishments have been at the various Pokémon Leagues. He was the victor at the Orange League and the Battle Frontier. He also competed in the Indigo League and the Johto Silver Conference where he placed admirably in both those competitions as well.
Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup
Ash participated in the Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup at the Kagome Town stadium. In the first round he was in the fifth match and faced off against Marris. The match was quickly showcased and Ash won the battle and advanced to the second round while Marris was eliminated from the tournament.
The Isshu League
Ash participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where he was matched up against Trip. Trip`s Serperior was sent out to battle Pikachu and Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior`s speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter Trip`s Serperior speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round. The two met in the Pokémon Center after the battle, and Trip vowed that the next time they met that he would win. The two shook hands and parted ways.
In the first main round, Ash`s opponent was shown on the match up electronic board but not much else is known about the battle. Ash`s Scraggy participated in the second main round of the Isshu League tournament where it faced off against a Darumakka. It was able to defeat it so that moved on to the next round.
In the third round, Stephan was matched up against Ash. Cilan noted that the two of them have a very direct taste and that it would be a good battle. It was only a 3 on 3 battle but the both of them gave it their all. The first two battles of the third round setup the final match up of Stephan`s Sawk vs Ash`s Krookodile, both of which were very injured from the previous battles. Both of them did their best to muster up their reserve strength but in the end a surprise move of Aerial Ace by Ash`s Krookodile was super effective against Stephan`s Sawk and it knocked it out to give Ash the victory while eliminating Stephan from the tournament. Stephan realized after the battle that the reason that Ash withdrew Waruvial after the first battle was because Ash knew that Stephan would definitely send out Dageki, so he didn`t reveal that it knew Aerial Ace and saved until the end.</description>

<description>The Beginning
On the morning that Ash was to start his Pokémon journey, he woke up late and by the time he reached Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory, all of the beginner Pokémon were already taken. However, Professor Samual Oak did have one Pokémon left, a wild Pikachu. At first, Pikachu did not like Ash and would refuse to enter his PokéBall. He would often laugh at Ash`s failures and refused to listen to him. However, after Ash proved his loyalty to Pikachu by protecting him from a flock of Spearow, and thus began to earn Pikachu`s trust and respect. The two have since become best friends and Pikachu never leaves Ash`s side.
Since the day Team Rocket first encountered Pikachu, it has been their sole goal to capture it. Day after day, their plan to capture Pikachu has been thwarted mainly due to Pikachu`s amazingly powerful Thunderbolt that keeps on blasting them off.
On numerous occasions, Pikachu has made it evident that he is happy being a Pikachu and has no desire to evolve into a more powerful Raichu. It has proven time and time again that it is a powerful and worthy opponent to any Pokémon that dares to battle it.
Gym Battle against Burgh`s Leavanny
Pikachu was then sent out to battle Burgh`s Leavanny. Burgh`s Leavanny managed to tie up Pikachu with String Shot but unlike Ash`s Swadloon who was able to break free, Pikachu ended up getting hit with a couple of Leaf Storm attacks and a Hyper Beam before it rolled into another of Burgh`s Leavanny`s Leaf Storm attacks to break the string off its body so it could attack. Freed from the String Shot, Burgh`s Leavanny tried to tie it up again but Pikachu managed to avoid it with its speed and then knocked Burgh`s Leavanny out with a combination of Iron Tail and Electro Ball.
Gym Battle against Elesa
Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy and was then matched up with Pikachu. Pikachu made quick work of Elesa`s Emolga and knocked it out with one attack, its Iron Tail.
Elesa`s Tynamo was the last Pokémon that she used in her gym battle against Ash. It was matched up against Pikachu who had just defeated her Emonga. Pikachu had a hard time defending against the fast Tackle attack that Elesa`s Tynamo kept hitting it with but Pikachu used its Thunderbolt to create a large dust cloud leaving only a small corridor for Pikachu to focus on it and so Elesa`s Tynamo couldn`t maneuver out of the way. Pikachu one hit K.O`d Elesa`s Tynamo with a Iron Tail. The loss gave Ash the overall victory.
Battle against Alder`s Bouffalant
Ash challenged Alder to a battle and he accepted though he had been walking all night and was actually quite tired. Alder sent out his Buffron to battle Pikachu but just as the battle started, Alder fell asleep standing up and didn`t give any orders to his Buffron. Alder`s Bouffalant stood still as Pikachu began hitting it with attack after attack until it Alder`s Bouffalant finally got mad at Alder and charged at him and set him flying into a tree. After that, Alder`s Bouffalant no longer wished to battle and Alder conceded the battle.
Gym Battle against Skyla
In Skyla air battle simulation, Ash`s Tranquill was matched up against Skyla`s Unfezant and since her Pokémon was the highest evolved form, she determined that her Pokémon would be the winner in that match-up. In the actual gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was up against Skyla`s Unfezant which was the match-up just after Ash`s Tranquill had defeated Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla`s Unfezant proved to be stronger and faster than Ash`s Tranquill, so Ash recalled it and set out Pikachu. Pikachu had a definite advantage over Skyla`s Unfezant with its electric attacks and it quickly knocked it out with its Electro Ball attack.
Ash Just after Pikachu ended up knocking out Skyla`s Unfezant, Skyla`s Swanna was sent out to battle against it. Skyla had been watching her grandpa`s battle videos and noticed that he used the move Aqua Ring to defend against Electric attacks. She used that same defense against Pikachu which nullified its Electric attacks. It`s Iron Tail also couldn`t hit it so high in the air. Ash then noticed the rings in the air and Pikachu jumped up on them and managed to hit Skyla`s Swanna but not directly. Pikachu was now up in the air though and Skyla`s Swanna had the advantage there and it quickly knocked Pikachu out with a powerful Brave Bird attack.
Battle Against Trip`s Serperior at the Isshu League
Pikachu participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where it is was matched up against Trip`s Serperior. Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter its speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round.</description>

<description>While Wobbuffet is technically Jessie`s Pokémon, it has been around so long that it has become a main character, appearing in almost every episode of the series since it debut.
Wobbuffet was first seen walking around with Benny, his previous trainer. Jessie traded her Lickitung for Wobbuffet and it has been with her ever since that day.
Wobbuffet rarely battles but when he does, his Counter and Mirror Coat moves have proved to be very effective. Unfortunately, Jessie`s tactics aren`t always sufficient to master Wobbuffet`s superior defensive skills.
Wobbuffet also randomly comes out of his Pokeball, especially during the Team Rocket motto. He is also seen blasting off with Jessie regardless if he was actually part of the action.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Xerneas is a Fairy-type Legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation VI.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
Along with Chespin, Fennekin, Froakie, and Yveltal, it was the first Generation VI Pokémon to be revealed to the public on January 8, 2013 as part of the Pokémon Direct broadcast.
Xerneas is the game mascot of Pokémon X, appearing on the boxart. It is a member of the aura trio with Yveltal and Zygarde.
Xerneas is a quadruped, stag-like Pokémon with four pairs of antlers. Its coloration varies slightly depending on which mode it is in: Active Mode or Neutral Mode. Regardless of mode, its main body is always black with a blue stripe down its back and a short, bushy tail. Starting at its knees there is a blade-like trim around each leg, which forms a point under each hoof. There is an upside-down, V-shaped marking on its chest in the same color as the trim on its legs. Its head and neck are blue, and there are two large, tufts that extend onto its chest and curve upward. Its first pair of antlers extends onto its head and curves around the underside of its eyes. The eyes are black with X-shaped pupils. There is a short marking on top of its snout and an upward curving horn on each side of its head in place of ears.
In Active Mode, its markings, antlers, and the trim on its legs is pale gold. Its antlers have branches and bumps in many colors and there are multicolored spots on its back. In Neutral Mode, its marking and antlers are instead pale blue and the embellishments on its antlers and spots on its back are a darker blue.
Xerneas has the power to share eternal life. This occurs when the horns on its head shine in seven colors. As seen in the anime, if it expends too much life energy it transforms into a tree and sleeps for 1,000 years. Xerneas is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Geomancy.</description>

This particular Froakie is a bit different to the other ones the professor had given out. It refused to listen to its trainers during battle, it ran away from a trainer simply because it didn`t like its trainer and several trainers have returned it to Professor Sycamore lab.
Froakie though took a liking to Ash and it came to the rescue when Team Rocket was trying to steal Pikachu. It also accompanied Ash up the Prism Tower when they went after Garchomp. Finally, as Ash was leaving the lab, Froakie appeared with its Poké Ball, indicating that it wanted to travel with him. Ash agreed and he caught Froakie.</description>

<description>Ash`s Fletchinder was revealed in the 2nd opening and 2nd ending of the XY anime in Japan. Ash`s Fletchling evolved into Ash`s Fletchinder during a battle against Nami`s Talonflame.
Evolving into Fletchinder
Nami challenged Ash Ketchum to a sky battle and initially chose Ash`s Fletchling to battle her but Nami`s Talonflame thought it was too weak to battle against and wanted to battle Ash`s Hawlucha instead. Ash Ketchum made a deal with her that if Ash`s Hawlucha defeated her Fiarrow, that Ash`s Fletchling could battle it also. Nami ended up winning that match and Ash`s Hawlucha was defeated.
