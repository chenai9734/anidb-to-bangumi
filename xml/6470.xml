<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="474117">Would`ve been much better if they expanded the plot a little more and didn`t spend most episodes on character introductions.  The main characters barely get any show time nor development.  Athena/Sasha almost makes it worth spending time watching.</recommendation>

<description>When the painting overtakes the sky, the world will come to an end.
A Holy War, from ancient mythology, where the Goddess Athena and Hades have fought against each other while defending the earth repeatedly over the span of 200 years. The story takes place in 18th century Europe, 243 years prior to the original Saint Seiya.
Three small children, Tenma, Alone, and Sasha have all shared a very happy childhood together. Tenma who is quite aggressive but upstanding has moved to Sanctuary to become a saint. It is there that he is reunited with Sasha who is the sister of Alone and leans that she is the reincarnation of Goddess Athena. Alone who is kind, gentle and loves painting was chosen for the body of enemy King Hades. Tenma eventually becomes a saint of Pegasus and engages in a fierce battle with his best friend Alone, the King of Hades. Pegasus Tenma, King Hades, and the Goddess Athena and through the twist of their 3 fates merge together which unfolds a prologue to the original Saint Seiya.

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

Feelings of any kind towards other characters are best shown by calling each other`s name, loud, REALLY LOUD. For better effect at least twice or thrice. For lover`s couples and mortal enemies it is a requirement to run towards each other while calling each other`s name, unaware of the surroundings.</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<name>master-servant relationship</name>
<description>To some genres, this would suggest a genuine pairing where one person exists to serve another person, such as in some action/dramas where the pair becomes united by destiny as partners — fighting or battles between different pairs/partners will usually be a dominant part of the story.
In other genres, this suggests a relationship where one person may be occupied as or even forcefully treated as a servant or slave to the other who designates themself the master — these services usually apply anywhere from tsundere/romantic-comedies to ecchi or to the more extreme in hentai.</description>

The leader of the Sanctuary is Athena in her human reincarnation. But since Athena only descends down from Olympus as a human incarnation only once every roughly two hundred years, the charge was left mainly to the Pope, the highest rank of the Sanctuary, and her second in command, followed by 88 Saints and more soldiers.
The goal of the Sanctuary is to protect Athena and maintain peace of the world in secret, with least to no interference on most of the affairs around the world in which most of the world population can solve problems on their own. Sanctuary will intervene only when the things that threaten to destroy peace of the world cannot be handled by any other means but the power of Cosmo, most of them cataclysmic and are of divine forces.</description>

<description>Altar Hakurei is a character introduced in Lost Canvas, the Elder of Jamir. Master of Shion, Yuzuriha, Tokusa and Atla, brother of Sage. He survived, with his brother, the previous Holy War. Hakurei was originally entrusted to occupy the Pope`s seat, but gave it up to his brother instead and he moved in Jamir. He once prevented his apprentice Shion to defect Athena`s ranks in favor of Hades.
With the demise of his brother, he has taken over the Pope`s position, faking that Sage is still alive so not to break the morale of the Saints. In order to break the seal that cut down the Saints` power to 10% by using the sword blessed by Athena in the previous Holy War, Hakurei decides to go to Hades` territory alone despite of Shion`s objection. Hakurei easily defeats the foot soldiers and upon entering the church of Hades, he is confronted by Hypnos, who brings forward the defeated disciples of Hakurei, Shion and Yuzuriha. Using the ultimate attack Praesepe Returning Spirits Wave Hakurei summons the souls of the fallen Saints from the previous Holy War, among them Cancer Sage`s soul. Hakurei uses their power to form a massive energy ball, which distracts the attention of Hypnos. While Hypnos is nullifying the energy ball, Hakurei unleashes his living soul to seal the defenseless Hypnos. However, before Hakurei can break the seal using the blessed sword, Hades appears out of thin air and kills him.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Cancer no Manigoldo is the Gold Saint of Cancer and disciple of the previous Cancer Gold Saint, Sage. He was shown as being somewhat hostile and talking in an informal, almost humorous way. Manigoldo is bold, aggressive, arrogant and very confident, he believed that the dead of all eras are nothing but waste. When meeting Sage, he decides to train in the Sanctuary to understand the idea that "every person who is alive or dead is part of the universe."
Manigoldo was taught by Sage a large number of techniques related with souls. In direct relation to the oriental folklore pertaining the Cancer constellation, he has the ability to send souls to the entrance to the Underworld with his Praesepe Underworld Waves, with Praesepe Demonic Blue Flames Manigoldo creates an orb in his hand, igniting every soul nearby, thus incinerating the souls of his opponents and with Praesepe Soul Burial Waves Manigoldo uses stray souls nearby as gunpowder to create a great explosion. Apart from the attacks involving souls, Manigoldo can use a physical attack called Acubens in which Manigoldo uses both his legs as pincers of a crab`s claw to cut his opponent in half, hence the name.
During the series Manigoldo encounters Thanatos, a feat which proves too much and has him almost killed. With the aid of his master Sage, however, he proves to be a challenge for the god. In his last moments, Manigoldo launches a last-ditch attack against Thanatos` physical body, destroying it and in the aftermath being pulverized himself, giving Sage a chance to seal Thanatos away. After the death of Sage, the soul of Manigoldo appears in the Sanctuary and gives to Aries Shion the helmet of the Pope to give it to his teacher.</description>

Due to living in that very same poisonous environment, his blood too turned poisonous after excessive exposure. This led him to be considered as extremely cold because despite his striking beauty, he tends to avoid contact with people.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Non-existent in Kurumada`s original manga, Heavenly Lone Star, Behemoth Violate is the "shadow" within Alone`s shadow that guards him. This Specter has the ability to blend completely into darkness, as she presents herself gushing out from her master`s shadow and challenging Taurus Aldebaran, proving she is able to fight equally at Taurus` strength. She is also able to see through the shadows of others as seen later in the storyline, when she is depicted kneeling before Garuda Aiacos, as her right arm. Here she showed to be quite merciless, as she remained indifferent while splattered with blood and viscera when Aiacos slaughtered a nearby rebel Skeleton and a damned soul. Soon after, she was sent flying by Aiacos` Garuda Flap, withstanding its force and using it as a means to assault the Saints, freezing most of them with her mere presence, where she presented her first technique the Brutal Real, a titanic stomp which destroys completely the ground below Violate. She was stopped by Leo Regulus, whom she engaged in battle. Violate`s apparent physical power was confirmed when she lifted bare-handed the whole ship that the Saints were repairing. Violate manages to crush the Leo Gold Cloth`s fist, and paralyzes the Gold Saint embracing his body with a huge shadow, a technique called Shadow Sewing. When Regulus manages to see through her ability, it is explained that she merges the dead from the 8th prison of Hell into the shadow so they can grab the enemy to stop their movement. She is killed by Leo Regulus` Lightning Plasma after he used his superior Cosmo to make Violate lose her influence over the dead. She reappeared some time later trying to attack Aiacos, although she stopped her blow before even hitting him; later it was revealed that it was Hades who controlled the dead body of Violate.</description>
