<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The main protagonist of Accel World. Also known as Haru by his close friends, he is a short and fat boy with low self-esteem until he meets Kuroyukihime. Although he is generally smart and careful when it comes to everyday life, Haru tends to get reckless while protecting Kuroyukihime. He views her as a mentor, friend, and lover simultaneously, which has given him the utmost respect and loyalty toward her and her army. His non-accelerated avatar is a small pink pig that was originally forced on him by his bully, only keeping it because Kuroyukihime finds it "cute." While in Akibahara, Blood Leopard gives him a different avatar to fit in, taking the form of a small pink lizard.

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The main heroine and leader of the Nega Nebulus legion, her real name is unknown, although Sky Raker refers to her by the nickname "Sacchan". Her pseudonym is a Japanese word play with Snow White (Shirayukihime, 白雪姫, literally "White Snow Princess"). Beautiful and popular, she is also the Student Council Vice-President at Umesato Junior High School. She has been a Burst Linker since she was eight years old. Kuroyukihime was formerly the Black King, although she was driven into hiding after beheading the first Red King, Red Rider, while trying to defeat the other kings to reach level 10. She values Haru as more than a subordinate and is often the voice of reason to him when he is willing to go to extremes to protect her. Prior to her hospitalization, she confesses to Haru that she fell in love with him. Her non-accelerated avatar is her real-world self dressed in black and sporting red and black butterfly wings. She was apparently born on September 30, 2032 according to her forged identity in episode 9. She is estranged from her family since she injured her sister, who is also the White King, out of anger after learning that she was tricked by her.

<name>Kurasaki Fuuko</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kurasaki Fuuko is a "retired" Burst Linker associated with the element of wind. She is also the vice-commander of Nega Nebulus.
Sky Raker is Ash Roller`s "parent" (the one who gave him Brain Burst) and the only person in Accel World he shows respect towards. Before Silver Crow existed she was known as "the person closest to the sky" in the Accelerated World, gaining the nicknames "Astro", "ICBM" and "Icarus". She became obsessed with the desire to fly and as a result was abandoned by her friends and "parent." Eventually, she gets the help of her only remaining friend and master Black Lotus to reach level 8. Having spent several level up bonus points trying to obtain the ability to fly, she eventually asks Black Lotus to cut off her avatar`s legs to reduce her avatar`s weight and increase her will. She is introduced to Silver Crow by Ash Roller in the Unlimited Neutral Field to help him control his willpower and use the Incarnate System to fly without his wings. After meeting her in the real world, Haru realizes she has mechanical prosthetic legs. Sky Raker later rejoins Nega Nebulus before the Hermes` Cord Vertical Race and regains her legs near the end of the race.
Her Brain Burst avatar appears as a silver-blue robot modeled after her real world self, lacking legs below the knee and confined to a wheelchair she powers through the Incarnate System. She keeps the wheelchair even after she regains her legs. Sky Raker is one of the only Brain Burst avatars that wears clothes, in her case a wide-brimmed summer hat and dress. Sky Raker owns an Enhanced Armament known as Gale Thruster, a rocket pack that, while not granting true flight, temporarily allows for incredibly long jumps and midair dashes. She lends the Gale Thruster to Haru to help him regain Silver Crow`s wings. Later on, Silver Crow shows her that the Gale Thruster is for flying in space as wings become useless without air.
