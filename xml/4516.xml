<description>* Based on a shounen manga by http://anidb.net/cr509 [Watsuki Nobuhiro], serialised in http://anidb.net/cr5372 [Weekly Shounen Jump].
The story begins when high school student http://anidb.net/ch13975 [Mutou Kazuki] is killed one night saving a mysterious girl from a monster, only to wake up and find it was only a dream. However, he soon finds out how real that dream was when a giant serpentine monster attacks him and his sister. http://anidb.net/ch6850 [Tsumura Tokiko], the girl from his dream, explains that the monster is a homunculus. Kazuki had been attacked and killed by it when rescuing Tokiko, however the girl revived him by placing a kakugane medal in his chest.
The kakugane, Tokiko explains, is an alchemical device that when activated can give him the power to fight homunculi. Using this, Kazuki creates his own Arms Alchemy (busou renkin), an alchemic weapon in the form of a huge lance. Along with Tokiko and her own Arms Alchemy, Kazuki joins the fight against the homunculi and their master.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>adventure</name>
<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>comedy</name>
<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<description>Every anime has to have them, episodes in which the characters for whatever reason end up going to the sea, ocean, random island or the local pond.
Usually used for fanservice purpose as it gives the staff the opportunity to draw the characters in swimsuits and raise the DVD sales.
The cheap version is the http://anidb.net/t6046 [pool episode].
Other marginally less used variants of this are the http://anidb.net/t3444 [onsen episode] and the http://anidb.net/t2830 [furo scene], used when it is too cold for a beach/pool episode.

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A 17-year-old alchemy warrior that was assigned to take care of a homunculus problem in Kazuki`s town Ginsei City.
When Kazuki tried to save her from a homunculus she felt a sense of attachment to him and revived him with a Kakugane, intending to make sure that he never gets killed again.
Tokiko is very dedicated to her job, claiming that she hates all homunculi, and quit going to school in order to be more efficient.
This hatred comes from the trauma she suffered as a little girl, when all the people in her school were killed or eaten by homunculi. The incident also left her with a horizontal scar running across the bridge of her nose and across her cheeks.
As such, she is serious almost all the time, which leads to some awkward situations between her, Kazuki, and his friends. Though her scar could have been easily removed by the power of alchemy, Tokiko had decided to keep it as a reminder of her desire to kill all homunculi.</description>

<description>Mamoru Sakimori, better known as Captain Bravo in the series is Tokiko`s commander, who dresses in an outfit that covers every inch of his body except for his eyes. Though Tokiko assumed this was to protect his identity, Bravo actually has no qualms with showing his real appearance when he acts as Kazuki`s dorm supervisor. He claims that he does not use his real name because it is cooler that way. The truth is he abandoned the name after his first and last mission in the "Showusei Team", who only managed to save Tokiko. He acts as a father figure for Tokiko, after rescuing her as a child; then Kazuki, who trains him "without mercy" when Kazuki becomes a full Alchemist Warrior (both he and Kazuki claim to be "Masters of Special Training", Kazuki at receiving and Bravo at giving). He is the only character besides Kazuki who loves green vegetable juice. During the Muto Assassination arc, he tried to kill Kazuki but he later defends Kazuki when Kazuki defeats him. He was critically injured by Hiwatari when he gave up his silver skin to cover up Kazuki and Tokiko from getting killed by Hiwatari`s Blaze of Glory. Bravo remained conscious and controlled Silver Skin to prevent both Hiwatari and Kazuki from harming each other till Showusei appeared and stopped both raging warriors. True to his name, the captain has a tendency to say "Bravo" when applauding someone. He claims that he has 13 different attacks regardless of identity, such as Comet-Bravo Kick, and Charming-Bravo Kiss.</description>

<name>Victor Powered</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Victor Powered is a former Warrior Chief of the Alchemist Army. He served as the main antagonist in Buso Renkin. Victor is an extremely tall and muscular man with dark green eyes, thick brown eyebrows and long brown hair. After his Permanent Transformation, he is most commonly seen in bronze skin, luminous green hair, wears large fluffy crimson side indigo wristbands, khaki Native American style leggings and loincloth decorated with black leopard prints at the bottom and an indigo fundoshi underneath.
A hundred years before the start of the series, Victor Powered was the leader of the Alchemy Warriors. Originally, Victor used a regular Kakugane until he sacrificed himself to kill the leader of the homunculi of that era. In order to save him, his wife Alexandria transferred Black Kakugane I into his heart. However, Victor lost control of the power and killed everyone in the lab, as well as critically injuring Alexandria, much to his guilt. Forced to flee his home, pursued by Alchemy Warriors and the homunculus group led by his own homunculized daughter Victoria, who cried; after the sight of his daughter`s sorrow, Victor managed to destroy a large portion of both forces before escaping to Japan. While there, he met Chouno Bakushaku (later to become Dr. Butterfly), and the two men then struck a bargain: in exchange for Victor`s knowledge of Alchemy, Dr. Butterfly would heal Victor.
A hundred years later, during the series, the plan succeeds: Victor is healed and re-appears in LXE`s Ginsei High School attack. During this attack, Victor kills Kazuki a second time by crushing Sunlight Heart with his own Buso Renkin, Fatal Attraction. This damage to Kazuki`s Kakugane causes Black Kakugane III to awaken, saving Kazuki`s life. Victor then decides to spare Kazuki, and after departing, he travels around the world absorbing energy from those he passes by, eventually retreating to the Pacific Ocean to avoid harming more people. He is later attacked by the Alchemist Warriors and changes to Stage 3 of the Victor transformation, which gives him more power and greater ability to absorb energy, and destroys Sakaguchi Showusei`s Buster Baron (which was boosted by the Buso Renkin of the other "Victor Assassination" Squad members) with Fatal Attraction. Kazuki then confronts him and forces White Kakugane II into his body, but this only reverts him from stage 3 back to stage 2. As a last resort, Kazuki uses Sunlight Heart + to send both of them to the Moon. In "Buso Renkin Period," shaken by Kazuki`s determination to protect Earth, Victor uses Fatal Attraction to send Kazuki back, but Kazuki drags Victor along, returning both of them to Earth. Victor reverts to his human form after being given another white Kakugane, and he then asks to be turned into a homunculus to lead all the homunculi to the Moon.
Victor is generally a cold person who hates Alchemy Warriors for hunting him down, as well as using his own daughter as a weapon. During the 100 year interval, to cover up the Black Kakugane incident, the Alchemy Warriors entered fake information in their own database, claiming that instead of losing control, Victor betrayed the warriors and turned himself into a homunculus, then headed for Japan to join the LXE.
For most of the series, Victor holds Black Kakugane I, which manifests as "The Buso Renkin of Great Axe", Fatal Attraction, a gigantic war-axe that is capable of manipulating gravity. It can manipulate the gravity direction on larger or smaller scales. It can used to increase the gravitional pull on an object or reverse it. The axe can also be separated into two to be used as double tomahawks.

<charactertype id="3">Organization</charactertype>
<description>The members of the LXE (the League of Extraordinary Elects) serve as the main antagonists for the first half of Buso Renkin, and consist mainly of humanoid homunculi. The organization was formed by Dr. Butterfly a hundred years ago when he found Victor injured, and pledged to heal him in exchange for his alchemic knowledge. The LXE was formed specifically to protect Victor until the treatment was complete. While most of the organization are homunculi, the LXE also employs humans as "Familiars", who are lowest in their hierarchy. These Familiars either use their influence to protect the LXE, such as spying, controlling large crowds through propaganda, or other grunt work, with the aim of becoming a humanoid homunculus. When a Familiar`s work is completed, either in success or failure, he or she is devoured. Because all the members of the LXE are either human or humanoid, they can use Buso Renkin; however, according to Kinjo, very few members receive kakugane, typically only those high in the ranks. The Hayasaka twins were granted kakugane to defeat Kazuki and Tokiko.</description>

<description>Sakaguchi Shousei is the leader of the Alchemy Warriors in Asia. Before he became the leader, he was the captain of `Shousei Team`, which included Bravo, Hiwatari and Chitose.

<name>Nakamura Gouta</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Nakamura Gouta is a rookie among the Alchemic Warriors. He is jealous of the relationship Tokiko shares with Kazuki (a relationship he wishes for himself with Tokiko), and as a result finds himself disliking Kazuki. Yet despite all this, he cooperates with Kazuki and Tokiko as they try to uncover the conspiracy behind the Black Kakugane. Gota is a strategic planner and fights with variations of his Buso Renkin. As shown in his fight against Negoro, he was able to figure out Secret Trail`s secret and use it against Negoro. In "Buso Renkin After," he returns to the regiment with most of the alchemist warriors.</description>

<name>Hiwatari Sekima</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Hiwatari Sekima is Captain Bravo`s former teammate and one of the Warrior chiefs. He is the leader in charge of Re-extermination squad. He has a bad temper and threatens to kill people, almost never plans things out first, and is willing to use the same tactic the enemy uses to beat the enemy. During the Muto-Assassination arc he said, "Unreasonable things must be beaten with the same unreasonable tactics." After Maruyama, Negoro, and Bravo were beaten, Hiwatari appears in front of Kazuki and co. to kill them. While Bravo tried to stop him, he released a flame storm that engulfed the entire construction yard thus leaving only the two silver skins intact. He went in shock after seeing Bravo sacrificing himself to cover his Silver Skin around Kazuki and Tokiko, and is angered by how Kazuki wants revenge. The two of them engaged in a fierce battle, only to have each of their attacks shielded from the other person by Silver Skin fragments. They were then stopped by Sakaguchi Shousei, the Asia leader of the Alchemy Warriors. Hiwatari is also known as the Alchemy Warrior with the strongest offense with his Buso Renkin Blaze of Glory. Every time he laughs maniacally, it`s indication that he hides the fact he`s sad and mourning as pointed out in his flashback as well as by Shosei. He is one of few people that call Captain Bravo by his real name and shows great respect for him despite how different their ideals are.</description>

<name>Ikusabe Genji</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Ikusabe Genji has an extreme thirst to fight Homunculi, and is the record-keeper of `Most Homunculi killed` (332), even more than the number of homunculi killed by Hiwatari and Bravo combined. Ikusabe`s powers come from his Buso Renkin, the Jumonji spear Gekisen`s recovery ability, his special ability and habit to eat remains of Homunculi he`s killed to increase his power and stamina, and the times he can use the recovery ability. Unlike Negoro, Ikusabe cares more about the process of battling than claiming victory, and quit the mission to kill Kazuki when he was defeated by Papillon. In the anime, it is not shown that he eats homunculi, nor does he send Papillon to Kazuki and Gouta. Instead, he falls to the ground after Papillon defeats him.</description>

<description>Negoro Shinobu is No.5 of the Muto-assassination team, he is an extremely cold character. Almost always hidden inside his own `space` created by his Buso Renkin, the Secret Trail. His clothes and his hair are sewn into it as well. The opposite of Ikusabe, he cares about claiming victory more than the process of beating his enemies. He was later defeated by Gouta when he hid in his own space after being ambushed by Gouta`s Motor Gear, only to have the two chakrams hit him again as both chakrams had Negoro`s own blood. He is able to become completely unnoticed in a crowd of people.</description>

<description>Tateyama Chitose is the leader of the Muto-Assassination team. Like Bravo and Hiwatari, Chitose was part of the Shousei Team. She is depicted as a serious woman who specializes in scouting and chores, and who appears to like to cosplay, though she denies this. She initially has a long braid and frequently cries, but is depicted as maturing after the Shousei Team goes missing. She is an expert in paring apples. In the anime, she leads the team that searches for Victor, composed of Inukai, Busujima, Maruyama, and Shusui, but they are defeated and only escape when Chitose uses her Buso Renkin, Hermes Drive, to teleport everyone out. She attends Captain Bravo when he is in the hospital while recovering from his battle with Kazuki.</description>

<description>Busujima Hanaka is a mysterious person who is always shown masked until "Buso Renkin After." Busujima cares deeply about Hiwatari and worries about him. In "Buso Renkin After," she is revealed as an extremely shy girl, who wore her Buso Renkin mask because of her shyness. Without her mask, she is blond wearing a blue headband. She can guess the oxygen density accurately, which she tells to help Hiwatari. In the anime, she is part of the Victor Search Team sent to find and kill Victor, but they are easily defeated. They only escaped when Busujima releases a cloud of smoke, giving time for Chitose to teleport the others out.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Maruyama Madoka is No.4 of the Muto-assassination team. Maruyama is a bishounen that is usually under the disguise of a fat, chubby ball, until Tokiko cut open the disguise with her Valkyrie Skirt. He was able to shrink Tokiko to 34 cm in their first battle, then seemingly shrink her to nothing in their second battle, only to find Tokiko still has 4 cm remaining and went into his stomach. He was defeated as his guts were ripped out by Valkyrie Skirt. His special ability is that he can draw a circle without using a compass. In the anime, he, Inukai, Chitose, Busujima and Shusui were sent to fight Victor, but lost against Victor`s Buso Renkin, Fatal Attraction, and was forced to retreat. He does not use his fat man disguise in the anime either. He is a homosexual, as he is listed as liking feminine activities like day spas and make-up, and also dislikes women.</description>

<description>Inukai Rintarou is No.6 of the Muto-assassination team. Known to have a strong sense of pride, and rather die then getting defeated and left alive. Inukai uses the Buso Renkin "Killer Rabies," two mechanical dogs that are commanded by a dog flute. He claims that anyone not holding the flute will get killed when his dogs are in berserk mode. However, at one point, Gouta used this to his advantage and took Inukai`s flute, resulting in Inukai nearly getting killed by his own dogs. He can also imitate a dog`s bark. In the anime, he, Maruyama, Busujima, Chitose and Shusui were dispatched to take out Victor, but they were forced to retreat.</description>

Her body was paralyzed after Victor went lost control, a century before the start of the series, and she moved her own brain into a container in the Newton`s Apple All Girls Academy. She lives inside her daughter Victoria`s Buso Renkin, Underground Searchlight, where she continually clones her own brain to increase her mental abilities and to complete Kakugane II. However, after a century in this state, her cells begin to die, and she fades away before the confrontation between Victor and Kazuki. Even 100 years after what Victor did to her, she still loves him and relays her daughter one final message before disappearing. While still in her human form, she specialized in making meat pies.</description>

<description>Victoria is Victor and Alexandria`s daughter. After her father lost control, a century before the start of the series, she was forced to become a homunculus and lead a squadron of homunculi to kill Victor showing her father her tears of what has happened to her. As a result, she came to hate alchemy, just like her father, and is depicted as having a sharp tongue and cynical attitude. She is also perceptive of others, and points out to Papillon the nature of his rejection in eating human flesh. Victoria disguises herself as a student of the Newton`s Apple All-Girl Academy, protecting the chamber that houses the multiple clones of her mother`s brain. She likes to eat "Mama`s special", a piece of food which is always hidden under pixelization, but which is in fact a piece of the dead brains of her mother. After hundreds of years, she is finally reunited with her father who asked her about her mother. In "Buso Renkin Period," she is shown following her father to the Moon.</description>
