<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="452112">Are you a fan of the Generation of Miracles? If so, then Last Game is a must-see, because it`s basically a fan tribute to them and adds nothing to the prequel. Not only did it make most non-GoM characters look bad (skills-wise or personality-wise), but it also deviated from the parent manga, Extra Game, in an illogical and poorly-thought-out way. The "villains" were irksome, which is weird because KnB has always had a knack for creating sympathetic opponents - something they completely kicked to the curb here. The art style is different from the original (in a bad way), though the animation was good. Game play was pretty repetitive; you won`t see anything much here that you didn`t see in S01-03. 

Tl;dr - GoM fans: go for it, this one is for you; everyone else: skip, it`s gonna ruin the main series for you. Especially the bonds that certain GoM members had built up with their non-GoM teammates, which they`ve gone out of their way to look down on here, for no apparent reason.</recommendation>

<description>Shortly after the Inter-High of http://anidb.net/ch39487 [Kagami] and http://anidb.net/ch39488 [Kuroko]`s second-year, a street basketball team from the USA called Team Jabberwock comes to Japan to play a friendly match against a Japanese college-level street basketball team, Team Strky. Despite their best efforts, Strky is brutally crushed by Jabberwock. After the match, the Jabberwock players insult the players from Strky and all of Japanese basketball, claiming Strky`s basketball is at the same level as monkeys` and telling the players and crowds to quit playing basketball and kill themselves.
Hearing this, an enraged http://anidb.net/ch43529 [Kagetora], who was Jabberwock`s guide and interpreter for their Japan tour, steps forward and proposes a revenge match with another Japanese team to take place in a week`s time. Out of pride, the Jabberwock captain, Nash Gold Jr, accepts the challenge. For the revenge match, Kagetora assembles a dream team of all members of http://anidb.net/ch43379 [Generation of Miracles] plus Kuroko Tetsuya and Kagami Taiga, along with bench players http://anidb.net/ch39713 [Hyuuga Junpei], http://anidb.net/ch43564 [Takao Kazunari] and http://anidb.net/ch51346 [Wakamatsu Kousuke], forming Team Vorpal Swords with the hopes of reclaiming the pride of Japanese basketball.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>Kagami is a serious guy who grew up in America till 13. He hates how Japanese students plays basketball but decides to challenge "Kiseki no Sedai" since he believes that "You cant live a life without challenging strong opponents".
He starts to hate kuroko since he plays extremely badly, and calls him a "bluff guy". but he changes his mind after seeing his impact in game.
He turns on and tries harder when people make fun out of him and call him weak and often laughs when he looses to a strong person.
even though he and Kuroko get along, he often starts a fight with him since Kuroko`s calm attitude gets on his nerves.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kuroko (or Kurokochi as Kise calls him) is a short stiff guy who plays basketball worse than any amateur. But, he has one and only talent that makes him invincible: he has a great ability in misdirection and passing the ball, also due to his extremely small size and build (comparing to other players), he often gets ignored and therefore he can "hide" himself behind other regulars and distract them by ball movement so no one will notice he is there. the benefits of his invisible style, (as taiga calls it) makes him able to steal balls from players without them noticing he is around. He is known as the Invisible Phantom sixth of the famous group of middle schoolers, "Kiseki no Sedai".
His Weak point is that he looses his effectiveness after 40 minutes and other players will get used to his presence.</description>

He shows a huge attention to his fingers and always polishes and adjusts his nails and keeps them bandaged.
Despite saying he dislikes Kuroko, he actually cares so deep about him (as his friend says) and always mentions that he highly respects Kuroko`s style of playing.
It seems that he envies Kagami for being Kuroko`s new "light".</description>

He works as a model for magazines due to his height and good looking face. unlike his manly looks, he has a childish manner comparing to his friends in the same age.
Kise started basketball in the second year of middle school and is less experienced comparing to other players from Kiseki and claims to be the worst one among them. He shows high respect among Kuroko and feels sorry for him to be among the weak team of Teiko high.
He believes that Basketball is the game of Size, but with all these, he tries to convince Kuroko to join their team.
His Weak point is that he cant copy Kuroko`s game style and also is unable to do much when he cant see the movements of his opponent</description>
