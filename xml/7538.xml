<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>adventure</name>
<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<description>The underworld we talk about here is not to be confused with the place where people are believed to go after they die, but the general term for organized crime. It is a shady world, unknown to most people, where illegal things like murder, smuggling, drug dealing and similar are happening daily. Groups known to be acting in this world are for example the mafia or the yakuza.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Monkey D. Luffy is a fictional character and the main protagonist in the anime and manga series http://anidb.net/a69 [One Piece] created by http://anidb.net/cr4013 [Oda Eiichiro]. He is a boy whose body is made of rubber after he ate a http://anidb.net/t2518 [devil`s fruit] and acquired the accursed ability.
In the anime and manga, Luffy is captain of the http://anidb.net/ch1954 [Straw Hat Pirates], a group of pirates he assembles himself as he quests to find the "One Piece" and become the King of the Pirates. His primary motivation throughout the series is to reach the goal with all of his comrades, a task he pursues no matter what stands in his way. While he is goofy and reckless, he gets quite serious when anyone is in serious danger, notably his crew, whom he considers his friends. Luffy has additionally appeared in all of the featured movies in the series and other media relating to the series, including several video games and specials.
His blood type is F in XFS blood group system used in his world. It is equivalent to B in ABO blood group system.</description>

Being labeled as one of the "Monster Trio", he`s one of the top three fighters in the crew. Zoro is currently one of eleven pirates who have been referred to as "The Eleven Supernovas", having a bounty of 120,000,000 beli.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Nami, nicknamed Thief-Cat Nami, is the crew`s 18-year-old navigator and thief. She has the ability to recognize and analyze even the slightest changes in the weather up to the point of sheer intuition. She is also an excellent pickpocket. Her dream is to draw a complete map of the world. Throughout the series, Nami fights using a bou-like staff that is made up of three connectable segments. http://anidb.net/ch478 [Usopp] later provides her with a version of this weapon capable of controlling weather, called the Clima-Takt ("Climate Baton" in the English manga and as "Weather Forcer" in the 4Kids dub). Even later, Usopp augments the Clima-Takt with dials, making it more powerful. Nami ranked in the Top 10 of all three Shounen Jump character popularity polls. Her backstory has been found to be a "touching story" as it "unfolds with a lot of emotion" by Mania Entertainment writer, Jarred Pine. Pine also mentioned Nami was his favorite character from the series, and satisfied with how the manga showed her past. While reviewing the 8th DVD from Viz Media, Activeanime mentioned Nami is one of the best characters from the series as "She`s got guts, smarts, and can heft a mean punch when needed". Like Pined, Activeanime liked Nami`s background and added that his "itty bitty heart went out to her".
When a reader asked http://anidb.net/cr4013 [Oda] who Nami is in romantic love with, Oda answered that there will not likely be any romance among the http://anidb.net/ch1954 [Straw Hat Pirates]. Oda explained that he does not portray romance in http://anidb.net/a69 [One Piece] as the series is a shounen comic, and the young boys who read the comic are not interested in romance.</description>

<description>Usopp, nicknamed "Sogeking", "King of Snipers Sogeking" (Sogeki no Ou-sama; "Sniperking" (Viz manga) is the 17-year old marksman of the http://anidb.net/ch1954 [Straw Hat Pirates]. His name comes from Uso, which means liar in Japanese, and Aesop, the author of The Boy Who Cried Wolf. He is a liar, talented inventor, as well as a skilled painter and sculptor. His primary weapon is a slingshot, which he uses to fire various kinds of ammunition, ranging from rotten eggs and shuriken to hot sauce, flaming, and exploding projectiles. Later, he creates himself a large, dial-powered slingshot he calls Kabuto, with which he is able to out range even guns. Usopp`s father, http://anidb.net/ch688 [Yasopp], left his family to become a pirate when Usopp was still very young. Some time after this, Usopp`s mother, http://anidb.net/ch648 [Banchina], fell ill. Usopp started telling lies, stating that his father had returned and would be taking them with him. His mother eventually died, but Usopp, in his sadness, continued to lie. Despite all this, he does not blame his father for leaving him, but takes pride in his heritage. He is inspired by http://anidb.net/ch474 [Luffy], http://anidb.net/ch475 [Zoro], and http://anidb.net/ch476 [Nami] and decides to go out to sea, following his dream of becoming a "brave warrior of the sea". His weakness as a fighter weighs heavily upon him and when after the crew is defeated and almost destroyed by http://anidb.net/ch3168 [Admiral Aokiji], Luffy decides to replace the badly damaged http://anidb.net/ch2028 [Going Merry], the Straw Hats` first ship, which is given to them by Usopp`s friend http://anidb.net/ch643 [Kaya], a girl from his village that he used to cheer up with his lies, Usopp goes so far as to temporarily leave the crew.
Usopp ranked in the Top 10 of all three Shounen Jump character popularity polls. In a 2007 Oricon poll, Usopp was voted the 10th most wanted character to receive a spin off amongst all respondents, and the 5th most popular amongst males. In a review of Funimation Entertainment`s second DVD release for Mania Entertainment, Bryce Coulter notes that Usopp "brings lots of comic relief to the series", but also comments that he "can be down right annoying at times".</description>

After the World Government destroyed Ohara for housing archeologists along with her returning mother, http://anidb.net/ch2887 [Nico Olivia], researching these stones, Robin spent twenty years on the run, cooperating with various pirates and other outlaws and became a member of http://anidb.net/ch2939 [Baroque Works] nicknamed as "Ms. All-Sunday"; Ms. Sunday (4Kids dub) at the time, being briefly an antagonist to the Straw Hat Pirates before joining them. Like the scholars of Ohara before her, it is her dream to find and decipher the Rio Poneglyph, which is said to tell the world`s lost history. Her devotion to history and its preservation goes so far that she will even risk her life to protect ancient artefacts and buildings. She ate the Flower-Flower Fruit, allowing her to create copies of any of her body parts on any surface that she can see. However, if her replicated parts are hurt, she feels the pain on her actual body.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Captain Shanks, nicknamed "Red-Haired" Shanks, is the captain of the Red-Haired Pirates and one of the Four Emperors. Shanks is one of the most laid back characters in the world of One Piece, preferring to take his time as he and his crew travels around the world rather than rushing from one place to another. Shanks isn`t cruel like many other pirate captains, nor does he rule over his crew with fear to gain respect. His friendly nature means he won`t purposely seek to harm others. Shanks doesn`t seem to mind what happens to himself; he`ll take others throwing food and drink or spitting on him without fighting back and laugh with his crew at his own misfortunes. However he would never forgive anyone for attacking a friend. Shanks is a former member of the Roger Pirates, where he had a rivalry with Buggy.ch. At the beginning of the series, Shanks loses his left arm while saving 7-year-old Luffy`s life, and afterwards entrusts the boy with his favorite straw hat.ch. Shanks is a skilled swordsman. Before he lost his arm, he used to have frequent duels with Dracule Mihawk. He also has King Ambition, which allows him to render beings of weak determination in his proximity unconscious. Shanks recently appeared during the Battle of Marineford, with the purpose of bringing it to an end.ch. Oda states that Shanks is the One Piece character that most resembles himself, because of his fun-loving, partying nature.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Yasopp is the sharpshooter of the Red-Haired Pirates, and the father of Usopp and husband of Banchina. He shares many personality traits with his son, including being able to encourage the rest of his crew to join in with his fun. He is very proud of his son Usopp, to the point where he would often talk over and over again about his son to Luffy (which led Luffy to recognize Usopp on sight from Yasopp`s stories alone). During his time in Luffy`s village Yasopp felt close to Luffy, who was the same age as Usopp, because he was separated from his son Usopp. Yasopp is portrayed as a virtually unequaled sharpshooter, capable of shooting the antennas off an ant at 100 feet without harming the rest of it. Being a sniper, Yasopp carries guns around with him almost all the time. He is mostly seen carrying a musket, likely from personal preference.</description>

Twenty years ago, Titi was seen alive, four years before Vivi was born, with http://anidb.net/ch3031 [Igaram] as Cobra remarked about the dangerous era they were entering.
She died at some point when Vivi was very young. She has been dead for at least eleven years as she was absent in all of Vivi`s flashbacks for that period. Vivi is supposedly a spitting image of her mother; so much so that when she was dressed up for her coming of age ceremony, Cobra almost mistook Vivi for her late mother.</description>

* Abilities:
Blackbeard possesses incredible natural strength, evident of his massive build, he has eaten the Yami Yami no Mi, with it, he can manipulate gravity.
Due to the Yami Yami no Mi`s gravitational ability, Blackbeard, unlike every other Logia user, cannot let attacks simply pass through him, meaning he takes damage like any human would but is also able to withstand more pain. He compensates for this one major flaw with his massive strength.
The second, and most frightening power of the fruit is to nullify other Devil Fruit abilities through physical contact.</description>
