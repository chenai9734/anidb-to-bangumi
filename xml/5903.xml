<description>2312 A.D. Four years have passed since the final battle between Celestial Being and the UN Forces. Humanity, after having established the Earth Sphere Federation, forms an independent security force, Arrows, separate from the formal Federation army to further unify nations and the will of mankind. But the reality is the inhumane oppression of anti-government powers, doctrines, and ideologies in the name of unity. Setsuna F. Seiei, after surviving the battle four years ago, has decided to once again fight with his Gundam.

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>death is cheap</name>
<description>Important characters will have a terrible tendency to die dramatically, but will not, under any circumstances, stay dead. This tends to cheapen the dramatic death of a character to the point of being little more than a flesh wound if overused. If you ever hear passing mention of any form of afterlife in a series, be warned that the value of "dead" has become a whole lot less all of a sudden. Similarly, if the entire supporting cast is being killed off left and right, expect a resurrection by the end of the current arc. This trope became so common in some series that most people are more likely to be shocked if a character does not come back from the dead than when it does.</description>

<name>star-crossed lovers</name>
<description>Two lovers — usually teenagers — destined to be kept apart no matter how hard they struggle to be together. It may be fate or just feuding families, or even something as mundane as a few hundred miles, but something will always be in their way. Often, the two can only be together in death. The phrase is astrological in origin, stemming from the belief that the positions of the stars ruled over people`s fates. To describe a relationship as "star-crossed" is to say that it is "thwarted by a malign star", or that the stars are working against the relationship. Shakespeare`s Romeo and Juliet is the most famous example of this archetype but it dates back at least as far as the ancient Greeks.
"From forth the fatal loins of these two foes, / a pair of star-cross`d lovers, take their life."
- Romeo and Juliet, prologue</description>

<name>rebellion</name>
<description>Rebellion, uprising, or insurrection is a refusal of obedience or order. It may, therefore, be seen as encompassing a range of behaviors aimed at destroying or taking over the position of an established authority such as a government, governor, president, political leader, financial institution, or person in charge. On the one hand the forms of behaviour can include non-violent methods such as the (overlapping but not quite identical) phenomena of civil disobedience, civil resistance and nonviolent resistance. On the other hand it may encompass violent campaigns. Those who participate in rebellions, especially if they are armed rebellions, are known as "rebels".&#13;

<name>hard science fiction</name>
<description>Hard science fiction is a category of http://anidb.net/t2846 [science fiction] characterised by an emphasis on scientific accuracy, technical detail, or both. The term is not defined precisely, and is often seen as an approximate way of describing works. Stories revolving around scientific and technical consistency were written as early as 1860s and 1870s; http://anidb.net/cr5973 [Jules Verne] is generally considered the creator of the genre. Although not always accurate in his scientific depictions, and though Verne himself denied writing as a scientist or seriously predicting machines and technology of the future, the attention to detail in his work became an inspiration for many future scientists and explorers.
Nowadays, the term http://anidb.net/t7086 [soft science fiction] is also often used to refer to science fiction stories which lack scientific focus or rigorous adherence to known science; the categorization "hard science fiction" thus represents a position on a broad continuum ranging from "softer" to "harder". There is a degree of flexibility in how far from "real science" a story can stray before it leaves the realm of hard science fiction; some authors scrupulously avoid such technology as faster-than-light travel, while others accept such notions but focus on realistically depicting the worlds that such a technology might make possible. In this view, a story`s scientific "hardness" is less a matter of the absolute accuracy of the science content than of the rigour and consistency with which the various ideas and possibilities are worked out. Furthermore, later discoveries do not necessarily invalidate the label of hard science fiction; the designation remains valid even when a crucial plot element is later discovered to be incorrect.

<description>A little bit of the story is found after the credit titles. A little bonus for those patient enough!
This applies regardless of if the credits play over an ED sequence, or over the "regular episode" that continues to air into the credits.
A sequence at the end of an episode, showing what will happen in the next episode, is NOT a post-credits scene; that is a preview.</description>

<name>power gives you wings</name>
<description>It is not Red Bull that gives you wings, but power, most often even the power of love.
Whether it`s an android, a mecha, mons, a mahou shoujo, or basically any super powered individual, once they start powering up and become REALLY powerful, it will be indicated by them getting a pair of wings.
Specifically, feathery white angelic wings, sometimes also wings made of Hard Light or Pure Energy. These wings will of course allow the character to fly, float, and glow, all without needing to flap them!</description>

"TAMAHOMEEEE!!" "MIAKAAAA!!"
Feelings of any kind towards other characters are best shown by calling each other`s name, loud, REALLY LOUD. For better effect at least twice or thrice. For lover`s couples and mortal enemies it is a requirement to run towards each other while calling each other`s name, unaware of the surroundings.</description>

<name>Super Robot Wars</name>
<description>Super Robot Wars is a series of tactical role-playing video games produced by Banpresto. The main feature of the franchise is having a story that crosses over several popular mecha anime, manga and video games, allowing characters and mecha from different titles to team up or battle one another. Due to the nature of crossover games and licensing involved, only a few games have been released outside Japan, and in English; early English-language games only feature Banpresto`s original characters and mecha, and a flagship installment were to never be released until 2016, with the English release of Super Robot Wars V in Southeast Asian countries. The franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2016.

The Exia is intended mainly for close combat, and it can be equipped with seven different swords for different kinds of mission, including a huge GN Sword and two GN Blades whose cutting edges are enveloped in GN particles. Its long-range weaponry is limited to the rifle mode of the GN Sword and the small GN Vulcans installed in its forearms.</description>

<description>As the daughter of Ian, she was part of Celestial Being by default and learned much about engineering, GN Technology, and programming while growing up, and now joins the crew of the Ptolemaios. Normally at the operator`s chair but also a mechanic with the inherited knowledge and skill of her father. She brightens up her surroundings with her cheery expressions and behaviour; she particularly appears to enjoy asking others if they are lovers based on her "maiden`s intuition." Her carefree behaviour even when the situation is bad constantly makes Ian angry and scolds her about it.</description>

<description>GN-002 Gundam Dynames successor, which like the Dynames can use a Sniper Mode, by exposing a forehead scope used specifically with a rifle-like control device within the cockpit. The cockpit also contains a customized dock for Lockon`s orange Haro. The Cherudim is equipped with a dedicated precision targeting camera located in its head, above the V-Fin, similar to Dynames. In addition, during Trans-Am it deploys a HoloScreen, a targeting unit stored in the backpack which is used to boost Cherudim`s accuracy by increasing the speed at which it processes targeting information. The Cherudim`s primary armament is its GN Sniper Rifle II, which is stored on the right shoulder. Folded in half for storage, it can be used in this configuration as a short-to-medium-range three-barrel Vulcan gun. Its other main weapons are its GN Beam Pistol IIs stored in its backpack. Unlike the Dynames, the Cherudim is not equipped with Beam Sabers. However, The GN Beam Pistol II can serve as its melee weapon, sporting an anti-beam coating capable of blocking enemy beam sabers and can be used as an axe. The 4 GN Micro Missile Pods that make up the front skirt armor house 8 GN Micro Missiles that are identical to those used by the 0 Raiser. Finally, the Cherudim is equipped with the Shield Bit system which allows all nine GN Shield Bits, two of which are mounted to the left shoulder as a shield, another two on the knees and the others mounted around the GN Drive on its rear waist to be remotely controlled and used for defensive purposes, though they also store a beam gun for offense as well similar to the Throne-Zwei`s GN Fangs. Four Shield Bits can combine into one in order to emit a more powerful beam.</description>

<description>As the successor to Ptolemaios I, Ptolemaios II is a dramatic improvement over its predecessor. Ptolemy 2 is a multi-purpose MS transport carrier, capable of operating in space, atmosphere, and sea. Ptolemy 2 overall is designed to be a self sustainable warship, capable of providing combat support to their Gundams and/or Meisters in various combat situations on extended periods of time. The ship has atmospheric re-entry capabilities and capable of returning to space on its own. In addition, Ptolemy II is also a submarine. The ship is capable of diving underwater for infiltration and stealth operations.
The ship no longer uses a docking ring for launching Gundams or portable MS containers, it has a large MS container bay that directly loads their Gundams onto the two linear catapults to launch mobile units in shorter launching times. The MS container bay of the ship was designed to accommodate their Gundams and mobile support units. During underwater operations, the bottom of the bay can open for underwater launching or retrieval.
The ship is loaded with an arsenal of weapons for self defensive/offensive purposes and able to hold its own without the need of a Gundam. The ship can traditionally use high GN particle dispersal for stealth and GN Field for protection, but also have a holographic camouflage system to avoid detection. The ship was also designed to utilize the power of the Gundams, when speed and power is needed, the ship can utilize the Gundam`s Trans-Am system to temporarily enhance it`s capabilities and launch straight into space. Overall, Ptolemy 2 is a highly formidable and versatile warship.</description>

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>Gundam Kyrios` successor unit. Similar to the Kyrios, it has the ability to transform in between mobile suit form and an aircraft form for high speed combat. This is the replacement mobile suit for Allelujah Haptism.
Just like its predecessor, it carries a twin beam rifle as it`s primary weapon and a pair of beam sabers for melee combat. Arios` forearms contains sub-machine guns for rapid fire to spray a hail of beam fire against enemy units and can attack at greater speeds. It carries two GN Beam Shield emitters on its shoulders that can generate a protective GN field, thus a physical hand-held shield was not made. Its weakness lies with the pilot of Arios, Allelujah is no longer the super solider he used to be. The unit is unable to reach it`s full combat potential because of it.
Arios was later fitted with a new beam rifle and missile launcher pack to increase combat potential and survivability against superior numbers of the Federation`s GNXs. Arios can now vaporize enemy MS units with a single shot and manage more enemy units with missiles that can destroy or divert off enemy combatants.</description>

<description>Gundam Kyrios` successor unit. Similar to the Kyrios, it has the ability to transform in between mobile suit form and an aircraft form for high speed combat. This is the replacement mobile suit for Allelujah Haptism.
he new fighter body of Arios is meant for high speed flight and combat. The unit also duals as a semi-mobile armor against enemy units. Kyrios originally had a GN Shield that could transform into a pincer claw weapon that could grab enemy units and destroy them with an electro-blade. While Arios has no physical shield, the pincer-claw aspect was incorporated into the design of the front body of Arios`s fighter form. When transformed, Arios can grab enemy units and can either remove a mobile suit out of the combat zone or literally clip them down with its GN particle infused pincer.
To increase the effectiveness and survivability of combat, GN Archer was added to Arios` overall arsenal. The unit was originally meant to be a new generation of Kyrios` GN Tail Booster, but CB engineers evolved the design of the tail booster into a transformable MS unit for Arios. GN Archer is still a Tail Booster unit, granting Arios greater speed, maneuverability, and additional firepower with GN Missiles; the GN Cannon aspect of the original Tail Booster was never incorporated. GN Archer can break off from Arios for independent combat to help relief Arios on missions, but need to return to Arios to recharge as the unit is dependent on GN particles.</description>

<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>Seravee is the replaced mobile suit of Virtue/Nadleeh for Tieria, Gundam Virtue`s successor. It`s the improved heavy armament model, but unlike Virtue, Seravee has no second form.
Seravee is an overall improvement to its predecessor, Gundam Virtue. Like Virtue, Saravee executes overwhelming firepower suppression against numerically superior opposition and has thick armor for protection; as the successor to Virtue, this unit has notable differences in its armaments and capabilities.
Seravee`s forearm armor has a built in compartment to hold its beam saber. Instead of traditionally having the beam saber at the torso of a Gundam, Seravee can quickly draw it out of its forearm for combat. The four GN Cannons, located on the shoulders and knees, provide greater fire coverage. Hidden within the four GN Cannons of Seravee are additional MS arms, giving Seravee a total of 6 arms with 6 beam sabers for melee combat. This hidden feature was designed to allow Seravee handle melee combat efficiently and to compensate its deficiencies as additional countermeasure(s).
The design of Seravee`s armor was meant for efficient GN particle dispersal for both offensive/defensive measures. In addition, the rear face of Seravee (Seraphim) helps boost GN Field strength when encountering heavy weapons fire and melee engagements. The GN Field generated by Seravee works in conjunction with the weapons systems. Virtue had a lag time in between GN Field generation/regeneration when dropping the field for firing the GN Cannons. Seravee`s armor not only can rapidly generate/regenerate a GN Field, but also uses the GN Field to enhance the firepower of the GN Cannons and GN Bazooka when firing.
Seravee would later receive power-up components for higher combat efficiency and survivability. Seravee was given GN Verniers on its back, GN Field enhancement parts on its shoulders and legs, and 2 GN Cannons on its hips. The 2 additional GN Cannons give Seravee a new total of 6 GN Cannons, but the new cannons are simply fixed weapons and can`t transform into MS arms. The new silhouette overall gives Seravee greater firepower, higher maneuverability, and reduced particle charging when using special attacks like Burst Mode. Seravee is only comparable to Gundam Virtue, with Veda`s unreliable complications, a Nadleeh sub unit wasn`t part of its design. As an alternative design, a partner unit was made for Seravee in dire combat situations, it`s backpack can transform into Seraphim Gundam.</description>

<name>GN-0000 00 Gundam</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>The successor unit to the GN-001 Gundam Exia and since its name is "00" that could possibly mean this Gundam is also the successor of the 0 Gundam. As the premier unit in Celestial Being`s 4th Generation of Mobile Suits, "00" (pronounced Double-O) possesses many of the previous generations` standard features, including the GN Drive and Trans-AM System, as well as introducing newer innovation such as the revolutionary Twin Drive System. The system utilizes two GN Drives with compatible GN particles production as the basis for the system`s operation, with their productive synergy generating GN particle emissions which exceed anything produced by a single unit.
The 00 Gundam`s arsenal consists of a small assortment of weapons, including GN Beam Sabers and GN Sword II`s--a refinement to the GN-001 Gundam Exia`s existing Seven Sword technology: in particular, the GN Long &amp; Short Blades. Drawing inspiration from the GN Sword, this weapon incorporates a beam rifle configuration to the melee-oriented GN Blade function giving it much needed projectile-fire capability, along with the traditional hand-held approach for more overall versatility. The GN-Sword II firepower is powerful enough to take out an Ahead mobile suit in one shot.
A tactical drawback of the Twin Drive System is the way the GN Drives are mounted upon 00`s shoulders. They aren`t shielded and depend on the pilot`s capabilities to compensate 00`s weaknesses/deficiencies. Should 00 Gundam lose a GN Drive in combat, it can still operate, but have difficulty of executing higher functions because the unit has high GN particle requirements.</description>

<name>GNR-010 0 Raiser</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="4">Vessel</charactertype>
<description>0 Raiser is a mobile weapons support craft to support specifically GN-0000 00 Gundam. It`s design is a cross between GN Arms and GNR-000 GN Sefer. 0 Raiser is a weapons support fighter that can detach and combine with 00 Gundam. The binders can attach upon 00 Gundam`s Twin GN Drive shoulder attachments while the main body attaches to the back of 00 Gundam. When combined they become a single combat unit, 00 (Double O) Raiser.
0 Raiser uses large GN Condenser as its main power source and is designed to charge using 00`s GN Particles when docked. It can be used in combat independently or when docked, and also stabilizes 00`s Twin Drive System. 0 Raiser is loosely autonomous with the aid of a Haro unit, capable of assisting 00 Gundam in combat and docking sequence; the unit has a cockpit for manual pilot control. When combined with 0 Raiser (through a laser guided docking sequence), the Twin Drive System is stabilized, and Trans-Am is fully operational.</description>

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>Because 00 is a experimental MS, the unit also suffers from power stability issues and requires constant maintenance. 00`s Twin Drive System was imperfect and requires 0 Raiser (00 Raiser) to safely execute Trans-Am and provide protection upon the GN Drives. 00 Raiser became the mainstay form of 00 Gundam to effectively combat A-Laws and Innovators enemy mobile units. As 00 Raiser, the unit has greater GN particle generation and the use of the Raiser System.
The Raiser System allows 00 Raiser to execute powerful attacks such as a mega beam saber called Raiser Sword, hyper vector close range combat, and utilize Trans-Am with greater power and duration. 00 Raiser originally needed both its GN Swords to produce Raiser Sword, but was later upgraded with GN Sword III. The new sword was able to utilize the power of the Raiser System to generate a refined Raiser Sword. The power of 00 Raiser is further enhanced with the neural interface of an Innovator pilot. The Innovator pilot can execute Trans-Am Burst, which results in a massive burst of GN particles within a large area of space. Overall, 00 Raiser is a Gundam that exceeds in performance to all mobile suits.
00 Gundam can combine with GNR-010 0 Raiser to become 00 Raiser, the binders detach and combine onto 00`s GN Drive shoulder mounts and it`s main body combines with back of 00 Gundam, giving it an mechanical/angelical-like form. Its primary function is to stabilize the operation of the Twin Drive System and Trans-Am System, allowing the 00 to effectively harness its massive particle production (which is too much for the 00`s frame alone) and utilize its full potential. With the constant need for 00 Gundam`s full capabilities, 00 Raiser became the mainstay form in combat. In its 00 Raiser form, 00 can generate 300%+ GN particle efficiency.
00 XN Raiser is the combination of a variant version of 0 Raiser and 00 Gundam. The docking system and appearance is similar, however there are notable differences. In flight mode, XN Raiser has the appearance of a X-Wing-like configuration. XN Raiser carries a pair of GN Buster Sword IIIs and have a series of extended wing-fins for aerodynamic flight. The GN Buster Sword IIIs act as a second pair of wings while in flight. XN Raiser`s binders doesn`t dock into 00`s twin GN Drives, they instead fold up during docking mode. The entire system docks onto 00 Gundam`s back as a weapons backpack.</description>

<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>GN Archer (pronounced "Gun Archer") is an transformable MS weapons support craft that can change to a MS unit and combinable with GN-007 Arios Gundam. Built in the L3 resource satellite, it was originally designed as a 3rd generation Gundam, but the idea was abandoned before its completion. It was redesigned into a support machine instead and given a huge GN Condenser. When combined, it feeds off GN particles from Arios` GN Drive. For the concept of the MS, it`s an improved model of Kyrios`s GN Tail Booster. This suit can combine with Arios for more weaponry, and when a pilot is in it, can transform into a MS to operate independently. Below the container, there`s space to mount guns.
In mobile suit form, GN Archer has two wide spread beam rifles to attack enemy units. The GN Missile Launcher upon its back can still fire salvos of missiles against enemy units to help Arios fend off enemy targets. GN Archer`s combat capabilities are comparatively lesser than the Gundams, but it`s capabilities rivals any GNX III and/or Aheads in the battlefield; the lack of a GN Drive limits its operation in combat.</description>

This suit can combine with Arios for more weaponry, and when a pilot is in it, can transform into a MS to operate independently. Below the container, there`s space to mount guns.
As a fighter, GN Archer is capable of high speed combat and have GN-missiles to defend/attack against enemy MS units. It`s arsenal is limited in this form as it`s main purpose is to enhance the speed, power, and maneuverability to Arios Gundam as its Tail Booster unit. Arios has no remote control(s) over GN Archer, the unit depends on the pilot to take action in combat situations. The unit can detach from Arios and independently fight to help divert attention from Arios or reduce Arios` burden in combat situations; regardless what actions the pilot makes, the unit is still dependent on GN particles to continuously fight.
GN Archer must always return and dock with Arios in fighter mode to recharge its GN- condenser(s) for extended fights. It`s considered GN Archer`s weakness as the unit forces Arios to transform (regardless of the situation) to recharge the unit to fight or would eventually power down. Under certain situations, this can become a liability as GN Archer hinders Arios to properly combat enemy units. Another unexplained design was its beam rifles can`t be used in Fighter mode, a feature capable from Arios. GN Archer would be far more efficient in combat had its guns were usable in flight, but for unexplained reasons, the guns are facing backwards and can`t be fired unless in MS mode.</description>

<description>The GNX-704T/AC Mr. Bushido`s Ahead (aka Sakigake) is a GNX-704T Ahead customized for close combat for Mr. Bushido, one of the A-Laws` most elite pilots. In keeping with the pilot`s apparent obsession with Japanese samurai culture, his Ahead resembles an armoured samurai, down to its main armament (a pair of beam sabers styled after a katana and wakizashi).
The cable behind its head is for providing extra energy to whichever weapons it might use. But due to its inconvenience in connecting and disconnecting, there is a special GN condenser mounted in its shield, for recharging of the extra-powerful saber.
The thrusters on the Ahead`s shoulders are usually horizontal, but Mr. Bushido has made them vertical for reducing interference with the swinging of the Ahead`s arms.</description>

<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Haro is the mechanical mascot of the Gundam science fiction anime metaseries, and is the only character that appears in more than one timeline.
The original Haro is a little robot companion built by the main character Amuro Ray. It is a cute testament to Amuro`s exceptional talent for machines. Haro`s features include a limited range of speech, and the ability to hover (in environments with atmosphere and low gravity) by flapping its ear-like appendage coverings. Haro can usually be found rolling behind Amuro`s next door neighbor Frau Bow. The ability to detect brain waves is also one of Haro`s functions; in one of the episodes, Haro actually claimed that the brain wave of Amuro was lowered/different.
In Zeta Gundam, a mass-produced Mk-II version of Haro ends up in the hands of that series` main protagonist Kamille Bidan, who initially suspects it to be the original. He repairs the robot, only to have it constantly address him as Amuro.
During the events of Char`s Counterattack, Amuro gives a "third-generation" Haro to Hathaway, the son of his captain Bright Noa.
Haro continues to permeate the Gundam franchise, having appeared in Gundam SEED as Lacus Clyne`s multi-colored horde of simple-speech robot pets, built for her by Athrun Zala. These Haros are roughly 1/4 the size of their Universal Century counterparts and are similar in function, however a few possess certain abilities such as unlocking doors. Lacus`s favorite Haro is a pink machine that she refers to as "Pink-Chan" (often translated as "Mr. Pink" or "Pinky"). Another notable Haro in Lacus`s collection is "Navy-Chan", a navy blue robot on which she paints a mustache bearing a distinct resemblance the facial ornament of the ∀ Gundam of the CC (正歴 Seireki) calendar system. The rest of Lacus` Haros have been seen in yellow, orange, blue, green, and black. The parody comic Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Club Yonkoma states that Athrun has built a total of 35 Haros for Lacus.
In Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Celestial Being had produced unknown numbers of Haros as an assistant of daily maintenance works. Currently at least 6 unique Haros have appeared in the animation production. The Haros in the series took much more maintenance and combat role than any other series` counterpart, usually seeing them operating with various machines, including mobile weapons.</description>

<description>An Innovator who is the genetic twin of Tieria Erde. Although he works closely with Ribbons Almark, the two do not always see eye to eye. As a result, Regene often acts of his own will to complete the plan Aeolia intended, from meeting with Tieria to leaking Veda`s location to Wang Liu Meis.
However, Ribbons was a step ahead of Regene and had Ali Al-Saachez kill him when he attempted to kill Ribbons. However, Regene`s consciousness lived long enough to see Tieria use the codes he gave him in their meeting to lock Ribbons out of Veda.</description>

<name>Homer Katagiri</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The uncle of Union member Billy Katagiri. He is the commander of the A-Laws. He also has a secret connection with the Innovators. When his nephew, Billy, is recruited into the A-Laws, he installs him as an MS Technical Chief and tells him that he has high hopes in him. When the 00 Gundam destroys the ship led by Lee Zhejiang to stop the Ptolemaios II from escaping to space, Commander Katagiri reluctantly decides to accept the aid of the Innovators in order to defeat Celestial Being and prevent further sacrifices. The Innovators soon deployed in the A-Laws as licensed officers, with new, powerful suits to combat the Gundams.
After the Ptolemaios II destroys the superweapon Memento Mori, the Federation government grants the A-Laws direct control of the military to further increase security. However, Homer fears that public support will eventually go to the anti-government force, Katharon and tasks Brigadier General Arthur Goodman to handle Celestial Being. His fears later realized when a number of dissidents in the regular army, led by Colonel Hank Hercule, occupied the AEU`s orbital elevator. Worried that Katharon activities will increase, Homer orders Commander Kim in the regular army to send Sergei Smirnov on a top secret mission to ask the dissidents to surrender. When negotiations fail, Commander Katagiri sends Goodman into space to use another Memento Mori to completely destroy the elevator. At the end of the season, after news of the A-Laws disbanding was broadcast, Homer commits seppuku rather than facing charges.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A fat man with curly blond hair who holds a high position within the A-Laws. He initially appears in the epilogue of the first season, next to Kati Mannequin in the Federation lineup, but is not introduced proper until second season. He overlooks the A-Laws` operation against Katharon, and is highly interested in Barrack`s and Louise`s encounter with Gundams Exia and Seravee, stating that "more equipment" is required. He is later seen in a conversation with Kati Manneqin and Arba Lindt. After Lindt`s defeat to Celestial Being, Arthur orders that the command be given back to Kati Manneqin, telling them that failure is unacceptable in A-Laws. He is one of the A-Laws officers present in the A-Laws party. He is later seen leading the operations to obliterate the Suille Kingdom, destroy the Africa Tower along with the coup d`etat forces, and attack Celestial Being using the Memento Mori weapons. He is also seen at the speech of the ESF President, and later after the operation in episode 19 to wipe out the Gundams and the Ptolemaios II, mocking Healing Care for her failure to carry out the operation, and also decrying the decision to give her and Revive licenses. His assault, however, fails due to an uprising led by Kati Mannequin aiding Celestial Being and Katharon, with Setsuna killing Goodman.</description>

<description>The estranged son of Sergei Smirnov and member of the A-Laws. Andrei holds a grudge against his father for not protecting his mother 14 years before the beginning of the second season and joins the HRL military and later the A-Laws to forge his own path. Andrei meets Louise Halevy and develops a relationship as he sees her more suited as a lady then a soldier, often protecting her in battle.
After the AEU`s orbital elevator collapse as a result of a coup d`état by the Federation`s military, Andrei kills his father in a fit of rage when Andrei assumes that Sergei sided with the coup d`état forces. He eventually comes to terms with his father`s actions and in the epilogue, continues to serve in the Federation army in relief efforts in order to live up to his mother and father`s hopes for the world.</description>
