<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="269894">This series has good build-up but absolutely NO turn out. You`ll watch each episode expecting some series action starting on the next episode, but it won`t happen. So in a sense, it`s good, but it`s also really bad. I would still watch it if you`re into the genre.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="404463">It took me by surprise, i was expecting a poor scenario and somehow lame battles but actually the story depth has a huge potential for a season or even a third season as well, fair animation and good side characters, somehow poor music if you ask me, anyway a recommended by me</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="290382">I liked this anime, but their isnt any end (hoping on a continue) :D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="515482">Pretty good !</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="590066">I really liked this series, though it is somewhat incomplete and I`m hoping they continue it someday.

I felt the action and fighting scenes were original and intense. The character development was interesting, I was really drawn in to the characters with how they felt.

Likewise, every other scene was not tits or ass or some comical 5 minute filler. I found the dialogue to be quite compelling and well written.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="1057">The characters are sorta awkward and the series started to lose focus towards the end, but this was a surprisingly decent watch all things considered. It had a good base and could`ve very well grown into a better anime had it received a second season.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="353610">(SPOILERS AHEAD PLEASE TAKE CARE) Regios was fun to watch overall, story skips around slightly to fast from character group to character group during the first dozen or so episodes. I enjoyed the action element but missed some of the daily life aspects that the creators partly introduced especially regarding daily life in the city, it`s politics and how average people were living. The three girls (a baker, police officer, and photographer) were a great asset for the kind of daily life routine they established in the beginning but later in the series kind of faded out of the show. I also wish later in the series there had been more time to learn about the other heavens blade users and their stories it was a let down regarding the amount of time they were provided. The main character could have been a little bit more fleshed out to. The show leaves me happy to have seen it yet I am unsatisfied and would like to read the original novel now.</recommendation>

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>extrasensory perception</name>
<description>Extrasensory perception (ESP), involves reception of information not gained through the recognized physical senses but sensed with the mind. The term was coined by Sir Richard Burton, and adopted by Duke University psychologist J. B. Rhine to denote psychic abilities such as telepathy and clairvoyance, and their trans-temporal operation as precognition or retrocognition. ESP is also sometimes casually referred to as a sixth sense, gut instinct or hunch, which are historical English idioms. The term implies acquisition of information by means external to the basic limiting assumptions of science, such as that organisms can only receive information from the past to the present.
In Japanese usage the term is often misappropriated to refer to any supernatural, non-magical, super power. Users of such powers are called `esper` in Japanese. The term `esper` is not normally in use outside of Japan but is slowly being introduced due to its usage in anime and manga.
In anime/manga the following powers, among others, are described as ESP:
- telepathy
- precognition
- clairvoyance
- retrocognition
- remote viewing
- aura reading
- out-of-body experiences (OBE)
- psychokinesis</description>

<name>swimsuit</name>
<description>A swimsuit is one of several kinds of garments designed to be worn by people engaging in water-based activities or sports or during certain activities under sunlight. Most kinds of swimsuit reveal a large portion of the body surface area, but exceptions exist. The more revealing kinds may also be worn as undergarment in sports that require wetsuits, or when there is a need to display the body, as in the case of beauty pageants or bodybuilding contests.
There is a very wide range of styles of modern swimsuits, which vary in relation to body coverage and materials. The choice of style of swimsuit is dependent on current fashions, community standards of modesty, and plain personal preference. Swimsuits for men usually expose the chest, while those for women do not usually do so; however, many women prefer to engage in water or sun activities with their torso uncovered, in a practice commonly described as toplessness or topfreedom. Since the early twentieth century a naturist movement has developed in western countries that seeks a return to non-sexual nakedness when swimming and during other appropriate activities; in some places around the world, nude beaches have been set aside for people who choose to engage in normal beach activities in the nude, and such beaches may or may not enforce nudity onto their goers.
In anime, it is common for at least one episode to feature the characters in swimsuits, usually as an excuse for gratuitous fanservice; when that happens, the episode is usually labeled a pool or beach episode, after the place the characters went to. Swimsuits, and in particular one-piece swimsuits, are a very common fetish in Japan; while the reason for that is uncertain, a common folk explanation is the fact that boys throughout their entire adolescence are commonly exposed to their female classmates wearing them, in what might be called an experiment in sexual discovery waiting to happen.</description>

<name>tsundere</name>
<description>Tsundere (ツンデレ) (pronounced /(t)sʌnˈdɪə(r)/ in English or /t͡sun.de.ɽe/ in Japanese) is a Japanese concept of a character archetype which describes a person with a conceited, irritable, and/or violent personality that suddenly becomes modest and loving when triggered by some sort of cause (such as being alone with someone). The inverse scenario, where a modest and loving person becomes conceited/irritable/violent, is also a tsundere.
The default state does not matter. The character can default to "tsuntsun" or "deredere"; the key concept is the fact that there`s a (generally very quick) flip from one mode to the other.
It can also describe a contradictory personality which is good-willed on the inside, but with a harsh attitude on the outside. Originally found in Japanese bishoujo games, the word is now part of the otaku moe phenomenon, reaching into other media such as anime, manga, novels, and even mass media.
Tsundere is a portmanteau of the two words tsuntsun (ツンツン), and deredere (デレデレ). Tsuntsun is defined as "aloof, morose, pointed", and deredere is defined as "exhausted, lovestruck". Tsunderekko (ツンデレっ娘) is a related noun, referring to a girl with a tsundere personality. Like nekomimi, tsundere is considered a moe-inspiring character trait. The concept has received increasing attention in Japan, with a tsundere cafe opened in Akihabara and tsundere-themed products released (like Tomy Co.`s portable television set), and the concept increasingly reflected in recent anime, from an extended discussion of the meaning of the concept and its origin on the internet in http://anidb.net/a4777 [Lucky Star]`s Lucky Channel segment to merchandise for http://anidb.net/a3651 [The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya] classifying the characters according to tsundere-ness. Another accepted definition of tsundere is a girl who has a combative attitude toward others but is also kind on the inside. She usually plays out as having an attitude toward the main character, usually a male, and often criticizing him in one way or another, but as the series progresses she eventually warms up to him and sometimes even falls in love with him.</description>

<name>school swimsuit</name>
<description>A school swimsuit (also known as sukumizu, shorthand for school mizugi) is a standardised navy blue one-piece swimsuit worn by schoolgirls. Typically they also have a name tag on the front. Sukumizu can also be black or white.
Normally worn at schools though sometimes also worn at beaches when the character feels this to be easier, forgot to buy a normal swimsuit of their own or wants to give some fan service to those that like school swimsuits better than regular swimsuits.
In http://anidb.net/t2856 [ecchi] anime, a swimsuit of this type sometimes serves censoring purposes when characters take a bath. If there is a group of female characters donning swimsuits, you can expect the youngest or youngest-looking girl to wear one of these.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>large breasts</name>
<description>Large breasts are breasts a fair notch larger than average, as found in some adolescent girls or fully grown women; however, as anime has no upper limit to breast size, the definition applies somewhat differently. To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<name>post-apocalyptic</name>
<description>An anime that takes place on future Earth (or it could be an alternative universe) after a major cataclysm has occurred. World War III, an alien invasion, plague, global warming or some other general disaster are common themes to build a post-apocalyptic world upon, where the effects were severe enough that mankind barely survived.
The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologised). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in an agrarian, non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of technology remain. There is a considerable degree of blurring between post-apocalyptic fiction and that which deals with false utopias or dystopian societies.</description>

<name>in medias res</name>
<description>In medias res, also medias in res (Latin for "into the midst of affairs (lit. into mid-affairs)"), refers to a literary and artistic technique where the narrative starts in the middle of the story instead of from its beginning. It is generally a plot-driven concept rather than a character-driven one; though characters are commonly used to provide the backstory. The characters, setting, and conflict are often introduced through a series of flashbacks or through characters relating past events to each other.
Probably originating from an oral tradition, the technique is a convention of epic poetry, one of the earliest and most prominent examples in Western literature being Homer`s Odyssey and Iliad. Virgil`s Aeneid began the tradition in literature of imitating Homer, continued in Torquato Tasso`s Jerusalem Delivered, John Milton`s Paradise Lost and "Inferno" from Dante`s Divine Comedy. George Lucas`s Star Wars saga was told using in medias res.</description>

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

She is very anti-social and not very talkative and shows little emotion, as psychokinesis users receive a great influx of information in their brains, and their minds can`t handle it if they react to every little thing, and restrict the flow of their nerves unconsciously. Because of this, she has a hard time making common facial expressions, such as smiling.</description>

He came to Zuellni with no interest in joining the Military Arts, and came for ordinary studies with just a Scholarship Rank D. However he was forced to join the Military Arts when Karian Loss, head of the student council, saw his combat potential.

<name>Hatsune Miku</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Hatsune Miku is a singing synthesizer application and its female character, developed by Crypton Future Media. It uses Yamaha Corporation`s Vocaloid 2 synthesizing technology. The name of the character comes from a fusion of the Japanese for first (初 hatsu), sound (音 ne) and future (Miku (ミク) sounds like a nanori reading of future, 未来, normally read as mirai), referring to her position as the first of Crypton`s Character Vocal Series. She was the second Vocaloid to be sold using the Vocaloid 2 engine and the first Japanese Vocaloid to use the Japanese version of the Vocaloid 2 engine. Her voice is sampled from Japanese voice actress, http://anidb.net/cr1673 [Fujita Saki]. Hatsune Miku has performed onstage as a projection.
Miku`s popularity has seen various references to her in anime. During an episode of http://anidb.net/a5576 [Zoku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei], Miku is seen auditioning for the voice of http://anidb.net/ch13125 [Otonashi Meru] (Kagamine Rin and Len are referenced in the same episode). Miku`s voice is used in the last http://anidb.net/s10696 [ending theme] for the anime series http://anidb.net/a6182 [Akikan!]. In the http://anidb.net/a5932 [Lucky Star OVA], http://anidb.net/ch32 [Hiiragi Kagami] gets magically transformed into Miku cosplay. http://anidb.net/ch11062 [Kondou Mikoto] in the anime http://anidb.net/a6685 [Kampfer] appears dressed as Miku in episode seven. Miku also makes a cameo appearance in the anime http://anidb.net/a6176 [Sora o Kakeru Shoujo] as well as getting cosplayed by http://anidb.net/ch2254 [Kannagi Itsuki] in the second picture drama.</description>

<description>The Queen of the Proto-City Spear Shelled Glendan. Despite being a queen, she is also one of the 12 Heaven`s Blade successors. She is vastly stronger than any of the individual Heaven`s Blade Receivers, and only if they all were to band together, would their power surpass hers. It is implied that her strength may be the result of possessing a Haikizoku. Bored of her life as Queen Alsheyra, she left the castle to live a different kind life under the disguise of a senior laboratory student, Synola Leiser. The Heaven`s Blade Receiver Kanaris Earifon Rivin was forced to cover for her, due to the latter`s ability to impersonate others. She met Leerin in a meadow one day, and they have been friends since. She has a habit of rating other people`s breasts, particularly fond of those from Leerin.

<summary>In the distant future, a polluted world has been overrun by havoc-wreaking creatures called contaminoids. Humanity, having been forced to relocate, must live in isolated mobile cities called Regios. Layfon Alseif, a young man with a mysterious past enrols in the Academy City of Zuellni intending to be a regular student in the Liberal Arts track. Nina Antalk, the leader of the 17th Military Arts Unit is troubled because a member of her unit has just quit, so they are short-handed and due to be disbanded. They need to find a replacement soon.
Just before the general assembly on the first day of classes there is a destructive altercation between two Military Arts students who use their Kei powers, and a girl is caught in the crossfire. Layfon intervenes, showing extraordinary skill in saving the girl, and he immediately catches the eye of Nina and the president Karian Loss. The president drags him into his office and forcibly makes him transfer to the Military Arts track, despite his objections, and when Nina arrives, he is reluctantly assigned to her unit.</summary>

<summary>Felli has taken a part-time job as a waitress at a maid café at Sharnid`s suggestion, and one day he brings Layton to see her. Like most nen`i operators she almost never smiles, and as such she intimidates the patrons, until the restaurant owner gives her a new maid uniform that emphasises her cool and aloof persona. Layton and Sharnid stay at a building across the street from the café in an attempt to capture Felli smiling, but she later catches them and punishes them.
Felli looks for a different part-time job and overhears the three girls, Mai, Miffy, and Naruki, talking about one that involves investigating an abandoned building. She joins them that night to explore it and they are attacked by a strange monster that appears to have been the by-product of earlier experiments in creating anti-contaminoid weapons, known as the Guardian Project. A military arts student who was assigned to inspect the building from time to time comes by as the three girls are captured. Felli manages to use her nen`i powers to cause a portion of the ceiling to collapse on top of the monster, allowing the other student to destroy it.</summary>

<summary>Layton goes to his part time work with Nina in the evening and he tells her a bit of his past life the the city of Glendan, and how he feels he is unfit for the military arts despite his skill. The city suddenly stops moving, as Zuellni, the electronic spirit that powers it is being abducted. While Nina and a mysterious man stop the thieves and rescue Zuellni, she is injured. As she recuperates in the hospital after, Harley tells Layton that Nina had once lived on Schneivalle, which was the only place where electronic spirits were created, and how she tried to save one of them from a thief and was injured, but healed by the spirits who sacrificed themselves to do so.
Later, he meets three girls, one of whom is the one he rescued, and they interview him and Felli. Felli afterwards makes up with him and gives him the nickname "Fon-Fon".</summary>

<summary>Layfon initially tries to back out of joining the 17th Military Arts Unit as he feels he is not able to balance that and his part-time work, but Nina is having none of it and introduces him to the rest of her team. She has a practice match with him and after initially seeing him fight well, goes all out and blasts him with her Kei, injuring him. Felli visits him at the hospital and tells him that she knows that he is only pretending to be weak, and that she is resentful of how her brother the president is manipulating everyone, including him, and asks him to let the Unit to lose their upcoming match with the 16th Unit.
He meets Nina again during their part-time work doing maintenance in the machine rooms of the city, and Nina tells him about herself and how she came to Zuellni against the wishes of her parents and as such receives no support from them. The next morning they have a match with the 16th Military Arts Unit, and when Nina is about to be defeated, he decides to intervene, using his full strength in an impressive display, capturing the enemy flag and defeating their leader as well. Both Nina and Felli are resentful at this, the former because she felt deceived that he was holding back his true skill, and the latter because he is playing into her brother`s hands.</summary>

<summary>It is a day of competition between two other military arts units and Nina has declared that the 17th Unit has a rest day, but everyone is encouraged to watch, which only Nina and Harley do. Felli is nowhere to be found, Sharnid has a date, and Layfon has been invited by the three girls. Only Machen shows up, and it turns into something like a date. The city suddenly stops moving, jolting everyone, as the city`s legs have gotten stuck in a pit filled with larval contaminoids. 
The military arts students are deployed to defend the city as the larvae enter a breach. Layfon tries to dissuade Nina from participating but she will have none of it. Layfon himself is troubled but eventually decides to join the battle as he realises that everyone he has come to care about in Zuellni could die. Nina is nearly killed at the front lines as her attacks are not so effective against the larvae when Layfon arrives and manages to very easily destroy many of the larvae. He realises that there must be a dormant mother somewhere underneath which will be trouble if it wakes up, so he goes outside into the toxic atmosphere unprotected. He manages to find and destroy the mother with Felli`s guidance and returns to the interior of the city just as he collapses.</summary>

<summary>The 17th Unit loses in a competition against the 14th, and their leader chides Nina for relying too much on Layfon. Later that day Machen is going over mail and finds a letter for Layfon postmarked from Glendan, from someone named `Lee-lin`. This surprises her and she winds up keeping the letter. The next day she tries to go to the 17th Unit`s headquarters to return the letter but is too shy to go inside, until Felli arrives, making her run off, dropping the letter. Felli picks it up but does not return the letter immediately.
Felli calls Layfon to her home, as her brother wishes to speak with him, and he helps her cook dinner. After dinner Karian explains about how it seems that Zuellni is for some reason gravitating to areas with many contaminoids, and a probe photo in the direction they are moving shows what Layfon identifies as a male contaminoid. On his way back, he runs into Naruki who asks him to help her out with a matter that concerns the police.
The next day after training Felli leaves the letter under Layfon`s bag, but he runs off and it falls on the floor before he notices, and Nina picks it up. He helps Naruki and the police by helping to apprehend a group of spies who have been trying to steal secrets from the city. Nina finally returns Layfon`s letter to him the next day.</summary>

<summary>Layfon, Felli, and Harley talk secretly about the plan to defeat the moulting male contaminoid that Zuellni is approaching, but are observed by Sharnid. Meanwhile, everyone notices how Nina seems to be going off somewhere late at night by herself, so Layfon, Machen, Miffy, and Naruki follow her. She goes to the site of the last contaminoid breach to practice, and as the four of them watch her, she collapses from exhaustion. They bring her to the hospital, where the doctor says that she is suffering from overworked kei, and should be forced to rest. Naruki explains to Layfon that she understands what Nina is going through: Layfon is much too strong, and Nina feels that she must get stronger in order to be able to fight beside him properly, and so pushed herself too hard.
While Layfon and Felli execute their plan to subdue the contaminoid, Sharnid confronts Harley while they are visiting Nina, and gets him to explain what they were up to. Nina, now recovered, along with Sharnid, join Layfon in fighting the contaminoid, and working together with Felli they manage to trap the contaminoid in a canyon underneath a rock-slide.</summary>

<title xml:lang="en">The Right to Be a Heaven`s Blade</title>
<title xml:lang="x-jat">Ten Tsurugi Juju Mono no Shikaku</title>
<summary>Golneo reveals to Nina that once upon a time Layfon had been a Heaven`s Blade, one of the twelve most elite military artists of Glendan, and that he had been expelled from the city for participating in illegal tournaments. His particular grudge against Layfon however was that he had permanently maimed a friend of his named Gahard Barehn in an attempt to cover up his misdeeds. He harbours no ill will towards the 17th Unit as a whole, but asks Nina to keep Layfon out of his way. Nina confronts him about Golneo`s revelations and he says he did what he did in order to survive. The orphanage where he lived needed money badly and the only way he could obtain enough was to participate in such illegal fights. Nina cannot accept this line of thinking.
The exploration of the derelict city turns up more mysteries. There are no human remains anywhere: some might be expected if the city were completely overrun by contaminoids, suggesting that the population might have escaped. The members of the 5th Unit begin to behave strangely, Shante even attacks Golneo out of the blue but is subdued.
Meanwhile, in Glendan, Lee-lin and her father are attacked by a monster, which turns out to be the mutated form of Gahard Barehn, who has been mutated by exposure to contaminoids. He is seeking out everyone who was connected to Layfon and that final battle where he had been injured, which naturally includes Lee-lin. Savaris manages to kill him afterwards.</summary>

<summary>The 17th Unit manages to defeat the 5th Unit in its second straight victory, apparently because its leader, Golneo Lukens, has a personal grudge against Layfon, excessively concentrating his efforts on him to the exclusion of the rest of the 17th unit, which managed to capture their flag.
The two Units, despite their mutual enmity, are later assigned to investigate a derelict city that Zuellni is approaching. They find that it has been attacked by contaminoids, but there is no trace of any of the former inhabitants. Nina recognises it as the same city that Zuellni had lost to two years ago, destroyed despite their apparently having a well-trained military arts group and a lot of resources. The moulted exoskeleton of a contaminoid nearly falls on Nina and Layfon, and Golneo declares that Layfon will pay for his crimes.
Meanwhile, in Glendan, Lee-lin receives Layfon`s most recent letter, and because of a possible threat to her life is assigned a security detail consisting of two Heaven`s Blades, including Lintens Haaden, and Saavaris Lukens, the elder brother of Golneo. The threat is unspecified but is hinted to be related to Layfon.</summary>

<summary>The 17th Unit goes to the city`s spa resort for a little rest and recreation. The president is there as well, resting after collapsing from overwork the other day, and he suggests that Nina teach Felli how to swim. She is initially sceptical of the reasons why she should learn, until she sees Machen being pushed by Naruki and Miffy into being taught how to swim by Layfon.
The next day Layfon is asked to teach Felli how to swim. The fact that she seems to be getting so close to him bothers the president so much that he calls Layfon privately and confronts him, warning him that if he does anything to hurt Felli he will crush him, which frightens and perplexes Layfon.
Meanwhile, a group of terrorists has invaded the spa and have taken the girls hostage at the dressing room. Nina and Felli manage to recover their dites and manage to subdue the terrorists.</summary>

Layfon tells Felli a bit more of the circumstances surrounding his disgrace and subsequent expulsion from the Heaven`s Blades and Glendan. They find a large number of graves, which deepens the mystery further. Layfon encounters a mysterious creature that was the city`s electronic spirit.
Later, Layfon is attacked by Shante despite Golneo`s explicit instructions to leave him alone, despite his anger against him. He has no trouble fending off her attacks. Golneo arrives and attempts to stop her, but their fighting has damaged a fuel container which explodes, but Layfon manages to use his kei to prevent them from being more seriously injured.</summary>

<summary>The next battle is between the 17th and the 10th platoons, and the commander of the 10th platoon, Dinn Dee, seems to have bad blood against Sharnid since he had once belonged to the 10th and had abandoned them in the middle of a battle for reasons that remain unclear.
As Felli and Layfon return after dinner with the platoon, Naruki suddenly appears and calls him off for an emergency. A group of outsiders posing as students has been caught peddling the illegal drug known as Overload, which accelerates the user`s kei flow, but it is prohibited because of its dangerous side effects. The pedlars are trapped in a building, and they make their move, making an explosion they hope to distract the police from their escape, but Layfon sees through the ruse and is attacked by a swordsman. Nina is startled by the explosion and runs to the scene, where she is herself attacked by a woman wielding a bow, who prevents her from getting closer. Sharnid, while following after his former friend in the 10th Platoon, Dalchena, stumbles onto the scene himself, where she confronts him.
The swordsman Layfon encounters introduces himself as Haia Salinban Lyia, a member of the Salinban Mercenary group. He says that he isn`t one of the drug traffickers but only accompanied them because that was the only way he could reach Zuellni. Haia proves exceptionally skilled, managing to break Layfon`s dite, and escapes.</summary>
