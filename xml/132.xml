<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="322302">I`d never think I`d like it, but it`s just one of the better series I`ve ever watched.
I don`t know about the manga, but it seems that if it is as better as some people say, it should be awesome.
And now I just want more ^^</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="180244">A good solid Shounen series.  The characters and character interactions are well developed, and the storyline is straightforward without being plain.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="254145">Cant get tired watching it over and over....</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="323982">one of the best series i have ever seen</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="299763">Fun show</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="476533">This is a solid fighting/action shounen, but I have to warn you the story and action does not really pick up for awhile.. you have to be patient.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="96331">This series and the manga are true works of art, my favorites of all time.  HxH succeeds through an intriguing atmosphere, interesting characters, complex plot/subplots and unpredictability.  Even the parts that some people consider slow have artistic appeal.  But, sadly, this is not an action-packed shounen for the masses.  You probably need to be an adult to get the most out of it (ironic, no?).</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="323049">Simply an amazing work of art. An anime based on a manga made by a genius, evidently for people of a higher intellect.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="292426">One of my favorite animes, is very enjoyable.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="464550">one of the old good animes to be found in the 1990`s</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="301225">Definitely recommended for fans of the shounen genre. I remember this show was quite big back in the day although I never got around watching it. Now in 2016 I watched it all in about a month. I praise it for its original storyline and suspense. Especially the Hunter exam was really captivating.
I did a quick comparison between this version and the one from 2011 but highly prefer this one for it`s more suitable tone, better drama, voice acting and absence of... pastel colors? Still, I hope to start the 2011 series properly one day. But for now, on to the OVA`s!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="224808">This is one of the greatest animes out there!&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a must see!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="341217">It has a great story and the characters get well developed.Its one of the animes that creates its own world and though in the begining it doesnt have a serious look you will still enjoy it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="374208">Def. a must see.  one of the all-time bests.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="412867">An amazing anime!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="249260">One of the greatest Anime in existance</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="47809">My all time favorite. Can`t be missed. This show will literally speaking keep you busy for a long long time.

Edit : The rerun of HxH 2011 is good, but this one has a lot of what the new rerun hasn`t. The Atmosphere and sound,music. I do recommend to watch this one as-well.</recommendation>

<description>Gon`s father, long believed to be dead, is still alive and was once one of the greatest Hunters in existence. Gon believes he will be able to meet his father once he himself becomes a Hunter. However, before he can become one, he has to pass the Hunter Exam first, an exam made of numerous tasks and dangerous trials. Persevering and refusing to give up, Gon manages to reach the Hunter Exam, all the while keeping his innocent attitude. Throughout many of the tasks and trials of the Hunter Exam, Gon manages to make many unique friends. Kurapica, a sole survivor of his clan seeking revenge, Leorio, who wants to become a doctor, and Killua, a member of an infamous assassin family, all eventually join up with Gon in hopes of passing the exam together. Each of them have their own reasons for taking the exam, but will they manage to pass it alive? It will be no easy task, as the tasks and trials in the exam are not easy. Aside from worrying about dying from the exam itself, Gon and his friends also have to watch out for killers participating in the exam... [MadX]</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>mafia</name>
<description>A mafia is a type of organized crime syndicate whose primary activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions. Secondary activities may be practiced such as gambling, drug trafficking, loan sharking, and fraud. The term was originally applied to the Sicilian mafia, but has since expanded to encompass other organizations of similar methods and purpose, such as in "the Russian mafia" or "the Japanese mafia", and is applied informally by the press and public, but the criminal organizations themselves have their own terms; for example, the original Sicilian and Italian-American mafia call themselves "cosa nostra", while the Japanese mafia calls itself "yakuza".

<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<description>Unlike most productions, where the next episode preview rolls *after* the ending with the production credits, this title does the reverse: preview the next episode *first*, then enjoy the ED (or skip it if you prefer, without missing the juicy preview details).</description>

<description>The Weekly Shounen Jump is a Japanese manga magazine released on a weekly basis. Its main target audience consists of young males and it features several manga titles. The magazine was created by http://anidb.net/cr780 [Shueisha] in July, 1968, and was originally only called Shounen Jump, because it was not published every week at the time. A number of very famous shounen manga were or are published in it, such as http://anidb.net/a386 [Hokuto no Ken], http://anidb.net/a231 [Dragon Ball], http://anidb.net/a942 [City Hunter], http://anidb.net/a826 [Saint Seiya], http://anidb.net/a590 [Slam Dunk], http://anidb.net/a312 [Yuu Yuu Hakushou], http://anidb.net/a69 [One Piece], http://anidb.net/a239 [Naruto], http://anidb.net/a2369 [Bleach], http://anidb.net/a4563 [Death Note], http://anidb.net/a3468 [Gintama], to name a few of the most well-known.</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<name>Hisoka Morow</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Hisoka is a magician, as well as a serial killer. Hisoka is deceitful, playful, and narcissistic by nature; he acts only according to self-interest. Hisoka combines his magic tricks with violence, and delights in battling against those he considers strong to the point of sexual arousal. In the manga, his sentences within speech balloons typically end with a suit symbol. Hisoka takes an interest in Gon and his friends after encountering them during the Hunter Exam; although he initially is posited as an antagonist due to affinity towards murder, he spends much of the series acting as both an adversary and comrade to Gon.
Nen type: Transmutation
In Hunter`s Character &amp; World Official Databook his height is 187 cm and in manga ch. 377 his height is 190+ cm.

<description>Gon Freecss is the son of the legendary Hunter Ging Freecss and the protagonist of the series Hunter × Hunter by Yoshihiro Togashi.
Gon was left in the care of his aunt Mito on Whale Island as an infant by his father Ging, and never saw his father since. Holding great disdain for Ging`s constant travels and putting Gon in danger, she forced Ging to give his son up so he could live normally. Mito told him as a child that his parents were deceased, but Gon eventually figured out the truth and chose the path of a Hunter to meet his father once again.</description>

Bored and tired of killing, Killua unexpectedly rebelled against his family, injuring both his mother and brother, and ran away to join the Hunter exam. He met Gon during the first portion of the Hunter Exam and became great friends.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Leorio meets Gon just as Gon leaves Whale Island to take the Hunter Exam. Much is unknown about Leorio. What we do know is that he once lost a close friend, Pietro, to a debilitating illness. Leorio feels deeply remorseful about being unable to save his friend, as the illness was entirely curable, but required a surgery he could not afford. Thus, he aspires to become a doctor--one that not only cures the ill of their disease, but also waives the fee for the poor. In this light, his outwardly superficial reason to join the Hunter Exams in the pursuit of great wealth has a more noble justification--the money he gains is used not only to fund for his medical school fees, but also to pay for the medicine and other miscellaneous expenditures when treating those who can`t afford it.</description>

Netero said to Bisuke that Ging is one of the five best Nen users in the world. He is also the main creator of the Greed Island game. He claims that he does not want to see Gon because he is too ashamed of himself for being absent in Gon`s life; however he was willing to allow Gon to meet with him after beating Greed Island if he was alone.</description>

<description>Illumi is Killua`s eldest brother. He is an experienced assassin, whom along with his father was responsible for Killua`s training and upbringing. During the 287th Hunter`s Exam, Illumi disguised himself as Gittarackur, using special pins to change his entire facial structure. Illumi holds a twisted and emotionless love for Killua. He and Silva raised Killua to believe that the only thing sustaining him was darkness, and that the only joy he received through the world was in causing the death of others. He was also responsible for planting a needle within Killua`s brain, forcing the latter to run from battles he was not sure he could win. Illumi did this to ensure that Killua would able to live to carry on the family business and as a means of protecting his little brother. This needle is self-extracted by Killua in the battle against Rammot. A certain amount of friendship is shared between Hisoka and Illumi, although it is unclear as to how it developed. Illumi once came to the aid of Hisoka by standing in for him as a double in the Phantom Troupe`s hideout, whilst Hisoka attempted to find Chrollo.</description>

<description>Hanzou is an 18-year old Jounin ninja from the Cloud Hidden Village whom has trained in the art of ninjutsu from the moment he could stand. He decided to become a Hunter in order to find the elusive Hermit`s Scroll. In the first part of the exam, which is a marathon, Hanzou is easily able to converse, while most of the others are breathless and struggling. In the second test, featuring cooking, he is the only one to know what sushi is, as it is a dish from his home country, Japan. He is the third candidate to clear the deadly traps and puzzles of the Trick Tower. In the final test of the Hunter Exam, Hanzou is forced to battle Gon. His speed, strength, and battle experience easily exceed that of Gon. However, the only way to pass the final test to is force your opponent to admit defeat - Gon refuses to do so even after being severely beaten. Hanzou breaks Gon`s arm to force him to admit defeat, but he still refuses. Noting the lack of hate in Gon`s eyes after this act, Hanzou realizes he actually has come to like him. He willingly bows out of the battle, giving Gon the victory needed for him to pass the final test. It is later stated by Wing that Hanzou learned Nen after the Hunter Exam, though he has yet to reappear in the series.

With the passing of the examination, a Hunter is awarded a license which bestows a number of benefits on the licensee. This results in massive registration numbers for the annual licensing exam with an extremely high failure rate.</description>

<name>Feitan</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Feitan is one of the original members hailing from Meteor City and currently the de facto leader of the Phantom Troupe. He is attired in what one would expect from a bandit — dark clothes partnered with a skullhead scarf that covers his mouth. He seldom speaks, but when he does, it is full of grammatical errors, giving the impression that he is not speaking in his native tongue. During the Phantom Troupe`s fight with Chimera Ants, Feitan reverts to his native language, which was shown with Chinese characters. After Feitan`s victory over Zazan in Meteor City, he is crowned temporary leader of the Phantom Troupe. Feitan`s movements are incredibly fast, being able to leave afterimages of his body. He wields an umbrella that conceals both a sword and a gun that fires out of the tip.
His Nen ability is called "Pain Packer: Unforgiven" which transforms the injuries he has received from his enemy into an attack. The more pain he receives, the stronger his attack is. Currently, only "Rising Sun: Burnt by the Sun" has been revealed, a miniature sun that burns anyone around him disregarding even allies, as shown by the rest of the Phantom Troupe fleeing from the scene when he uses this ability. Only Feitan is unaffected by the attack, presumably because of the armor that is formed on him. Nen type: Transmutation

For the next several months he teaches them the basics of Nen, after which he announces they have passed the secret final requirement for being a Hunter. He does however somewhat fear their immense potential. Wing`s teacher was Biscuit Krueger, who incidentally becomes Gon and Killua`s second teacher.

He organizes the Phantom Troupe mainly to commit acts of theft, though it is unknown what the group does with the stolen objects. His Nen ability also allows him to directly steal the abilities of other users of Nen. He led the genocide on Kurapika`s clan, the latter thereafter stalking Chrollo and neutralizing his Nen ability as punishment. Nen type: Specialization

His physical power ranks eighth among the Troupe, and he is the thirteenth Troupe member. Bonolenov is a descendant of the Gyudondond, a small wild tribe that was chased out of their lands by development. When males of the Gyudondond tribe reach the age of three, they are circumcised and needles are inserted in various parts of their body. Over time, these needles are replaced with thicker and thicker sticks, and the holes are stabilized with bamboo stalks or stones. Using these holes, Gyudondond males are able to create a variety of sounds. They are called "Bap", the dancing warriors, and fulfill the role of shamans and performers in their tribe. Before combat, they use their bodies to play songs of battle. The Gyudondond believe that the more beautiful a sound that is played, the greater the spirit it can summon. As a member of this clan, Bonolenov possess this as his Nen ability, titled "Batte Le Cantabile".

He is the weakest in the Troupe in terms of raw physical power. In fact, his Nen abilities so far suggest that he is not involved in combat at all, but rather theft and subterfuge. His Nen ability is called "Gallery Fake: Divine Left Hand, Demonic Right Hand", which allows him to make perfect copies of any object by touching it with his left hand and producing the copy with his right. The size of the object doesn`t matter. He can also make copies of living humans, but they`ll be immobile and lifeless. He`s also able to know the exact location of any copy he has created by touching the original object. The copies vanish after 24 hours have passed.

Shalnark is also a licensed Hunter, so he has access to certain information that could be potentially useful to the Phantom Troupe. His main ability revolves around remotely manipulating the actions of others using his cell phone by sticking a specialized antenna into their bodies. His secondary ability involves applying the antenna upon himself and putting his body on autopilot, resulting in an enhanced state with enough power to devastate most opponents. However, he dislikes this ability because he is subject to immense muscle pain for several days after its use, and as he has no control over the process and retains no memory over what has transpired he can`t derive any pleasure or satisfaction when he uses it to win a fight. Shalnark ranks tenth in physical power among the Troupe.

<description>Uvogin was one of the original members of the Troupe from Meteor City. Out of all of the Phantom Troupe, he was the strongest in terms of raw physical power. Uvogin was so strong, that direct hits from bullets, sniper bullets, and even anti-tank rockets don`t do visible damage to him. Like all of the Troupe, he never hesitates to kill, and particularly enjoys combat against skilled opponents. Although he prefers to fight alone, Uvogin becomes stronger when fighting with a partner, usually Nobunaga, because he fights better when there is someone else to protect (although he never admits this). Seeking revenge on Kurapika for capturing him after his battle with the Shadow Beasts, Uvogin tracks him to the hotel where Neon Nostrade and the rest of her bodyguards are staying. They fight one-on-one in a small canyon on the outskirts of Yorknew City. Kurapika eventually captures Uvogin with his Chain Jail, and questions him about the location and abilities of the other Phantom Troupe members. Uvogin refuses to answer any questions, responding only with "Kill me." Kurapika then pierces Uvogin`s chest with the Judgement Chain ability, giving Uvogin the condition that he must answer all questions truthfully. Kurapika once again asks him the location of the other Troupe members, to which Uvogin only smiles and says to Kurapika "Go to hell, you bastard." Kurapika`s Judgement Chain pierces Uvogin`s heart, instantly killing him. Uvogin is buried by Kurapika at the site of their battle. He was the eleventh member of the Troupe. Nen type: Enhancement

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kastro is a prominent and talented fighter in the Heavens Arena. He hang out on the 200th floor of the Heavens Arena with the intent on building enough wins to become a Floor Master. His only loss is to Hisoka, so he trains rigorously to improve his Nen. After accumulating nine out of the ten required wins to become a Floor Master, he challenges Hisoka to a rematch.
While he appears to have the upper hand at first, Hisoka realizes that Kastro has been working in tandem with a doppelgänger created through his Nen.[48] Hisoka then performs an illusion using Nen to throw off Kastro, which leaves an opening for Hisoka to kill him.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Senritsu (Melody) is an Music Hunter and is the kind and understanding member of Neon`s bodyguards. She is always ready to listen to anyone`s confessions and has the gift to make people open up to her. As Leorio notes, she is one of the very few characters who has made Kurapika open up to her. Melody`s physical appearance is in short contrast to her kind soul. Due to effects of the "Sonata of Darkness", a musical piece said to have been written by Satan himself and possibly inspired by the Devil`s Trill Sonata, her body is a short and her face disfigured. However, she was not always like this; she was once a normal person. She was transformed when she and a friend listened to the Sonata of Darkness. It is composed of four parts: piano, violin, flute, and harp, and it is said that whomever listens to it will be greatly cursed. Melody`s goal is to find the sonata and destroy it. Melody has the ability to emit her aura to people to soothe ease fatigue when she plays an instrument. She also has a very sharp sense of hearing and can tell a person`s psychological state just by listening to their heartbeat. For example, she knows when people are lying or when someone has completely lost his/her temper.

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Neon Nostrade is the only daughter of the head of the Nostrade family, Light Nostrade. She has the ability to predict the future through her fortune tellings which are always accurate, but are slightly cryptic due to their use of abstract references to events. Neon appears in the story when Kurapika interviews for a position among her bodyguards. Neon is spoiled; she receives everything she demands by threatening to cease the use of her ability for her father`s benefit. Neon is also very involved with the occult and is an avid collector of rare human flesh, such as the Scarlet Eyes of the Kurta Clan.
Neon cares very little about anything else other than her collection; even the death of her head bodyguard, Dalzollene, causes her no grief. However, when Eliza, a family attendant, is heartbroken, Neon agrees to leave Yorknew City, despite not having obtained the auction items she desired. She loses her ability to Chrollo.
