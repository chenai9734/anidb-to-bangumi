<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="180087">Did you enjoy season 1? Then sure watch this but not much happens and the quality goes down.
The character`s does not develop, several parts from the manga is omitted and then referenced in such a sense that you should know about it despite not having seen it. They talk to and reference things that isn`t in the anime which makes it hard to follow some parts and makes the impact totally disappear.
Overall I would say watch this if you really wanna see more of the characters otherwise either skip this or go read the manga.</recommendation>

<description>Recap: The high school student http://anidb.net/ch57797 [Ichijou Raku] is the son of a leader in the yakuza faction Shuei-Gumi, and http://anidb.net/ch57798 [Kirisaki Chitoge] is the daughter of a boss in a rival gang known as Beehive. Upon returning home, Raku learns that the Shuei-Gumi and Beehive gangs have agreed to settle their feud by pairing their leaders` children, and that his girlfriend-to-be is none other than Chitoge. For the next three years, they must pretend to be in a relationship to maintain peace between the gangs. To complicate the matter Raku owns a pendant which was given to him by his childhood sweetheart with whom he made a secret promise. Trouble is that more than one girl seems to own a key to his pendant...
After the school play, Chitoge admits to loving Raku. Any small thing might elate Chitoge, while the advances on Raku by the other girls annoy her all the more now. Though what will the next steps be? Go out on a date with Raku; no longer be a fake, but a real girlfriend; actually want Raku to like her?
When http://anidb.net/ch58637 [Shuu] finds Raku`s pendant, Raku tells Chitoge, http://anidb.net/ch57799 [Kosaki] and http://anidb.net/ch60162 [Marika], the girls with a key to his pendant, about its return. But since the pendant is still broken, they decide to hold off trying to open it forcefully. And so Raku`s complicated set of relations goes on, while Chitoge will still need to make Raku aware of her true feelings.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>A mafia is a type of organized crime syndicate whose primary activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions. Secondary activities may be practiced such as gambling, drug trafficking, loan sharking, and fraud. The term was originally applied to the Sicilian mafia, but has since expanded to encompass other organizations of similar methods and purpose, such as in "the Russian mafia" or "the Japanese mafia", and is applied informally by the press and public, but the criminal organizations themselves have their own terms; for example, the original Sicilian and Italian-American mafia call themselves "cosa nostra", while the Japanese mafia calls itself "yakuza".

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<name>melodrama</name>
<description>A melodrama is a dramatic work that exaggerates plot and characters in order to appeal to the emotions, often with strongly stereotyped characters. Language, behaviour, or events which resemble melodramas are also called melodramatic. In scholarly and historical musical contexts melodramas are dramas of the 18th and 19th centuries in which orchestral music or song was used to accompany the action.
Melodrama is a style of drama that has been applied on the stage, in movies and television, and radio formats, from the 18th century to the present. Because of the long timeframe in which the style has existed, it is difficult to derive a precise definition. The term melodrama is most often used pejoratively, to suggest that the work to which the term is applied lacks sophistication or subtlety.
The term originated from the early 19th-century French word mélodrame, which is derived from Greek melos, music, and French drame, drama (from Late Latin drāma, which in turn derives from Greek drān, to do, perform).

<name>Weekly Shounen Jump</name>
<description>The Weekly Shounen Jump is a Japanese manga magazine released on a weekly basis. Its main target audience consists of young males and it features several manga titles. The magazine was created by http://anidb.net/cr780 [Shueisha] in July, 1968, and was originally only called Shounen Jump, because it was not published every week at the time. A number of very famous shounen manga were or are published in it, such as http://anidb.net/a386 [Hokuto no Ken], http://anidb.net/a231 [Dragon Ball], http://anidb.net/a942 [City Hunter], http://anidb.net/a826 [Saint Seiya], http://anidb.net/a590 [Slam Dunk], http://anidb.net/a312 [Yuu Yuu Hakushou], http://anidb.net/a69 [One Piece], http://anidb.net/a239 [Naruto], http://anidb.net/a2369 [Bleach], http://anidb.net/a4563 [Death Note], http://anidb.net/a3468 [Gintama], to name a few of the most well-known.</description>

<name>diet</name>
<description>One or more of the characters in this anime go on a diet, to lose some weight. Typically a female character will be extremely distressed that her clothes no longer fit, or that her ideal weight has been exceeded. Ironically, normal growth is often the explanation.
Since diets do not work, this ends up as a comedy element, with many ridiculous attempts to get slim quickly.</description>

<description>Abbreviation for "three-dimensional computer generated animation" or "computer graphics" (CGI). The traditional 2D art is enhanced by 3D imagery developed through computer modeling software. Done in the right way, this union of 3D in a 2D animated world can be a very beautiful relationship.
The difference lies in what lacks the traditional 2D animation all together and may give term to something produced entirely with 3D graphics (such as the 2006 remake of "Appleseed" , 2007`s "Vexille", the 2008 addition to the "Biohazard" series and the more well known "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within" and "Advent Children").</description>

<name>season</name>
<description>A season is a division of the year, marked by changes in weather, ecology, and hours of daylight. Seasons result from the yearly orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth`s rotational axis relative to the plane of the orbit. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth`s surface, variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.
During May, June, and July, the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun. The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December, January, and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere.
In temperate and subpolar regions, four calendar-based seasons (with their adjectives) are generally recognized: spring (vernal), summer (estival), autumn (autumnal), fall and winter (hibernal). Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring (prevernal) and late summer (serotinal) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four.

<name>spring</name>
<description>During spring, the axis of the Earth is increasing its tilt relative to the Sun, and the length of daylight rapidly increases for the relevant hemisphere. The hemisphere begins to warm significantly causing new plant growth to spring forth, giving the season its name. Snow, if a normal part of winter, begins to melt, and streams swell with runoff. Frosts, if a normal part of winter, become less severe. In climates that have no snow and rare frosts, the air and ground temperatures increase more rapidly. Many flowering plants bloom this time of year, in a long succession sometimes beginning when snow is still on the ground, continuing into early summer. In normally snowless areas spring may begin as early as February (Northern Hemisphere) heralded by the blooming of deciduous magnolias, cherries and quince, or August (Southern Hemisphere) in the same way. Many temperate areas have a dry spring, and wet autumn (fall), which brings about flowering in this season more consistent with the need for water as well as warmth. Subarctic areas may not experience spring at all until May or even June.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Raku is the son of a Yakuza family leader. He refuses to take over the family`s duties as the next leader, and prefers to pursue a normal career when he graduates. In the story, he is placed in a fake relationship with Chitoge to prevent a war from starting between their families. The relationship often leads to misunderstandings and difficulties for him as he pursues his crush, Kosaki Onodera. Raku is shown to be very kind and caring even to the people he is supposed to hate, as shown when he helps Chitoge numerous times in the series. As the story progresses, he grows closer to Chitoge, and he even stated that he no longer hates her, although he has yet to sort out his true feelings.

<description>The daughter of the leader of the Bee Hive Gangsters, Chitoge transfers from America to Raku`s high school at the start of the series. She and Raku pretend to be in a relationship in order to prevent their families` factions from feuding. She is half-Japanese with long blonde hair that is tied with a ribbon. She is good at sports and academics, but clueless when it comes to cooking. Despite not getting along with Raku from the start, she makes an effort to find his lost pendant. Ten years before, Chitoge makes a promise with a boy; when she looks through her diary from that time, she stumbles upon a key that could potentially unlock Raku`s locket. Later she develops feelings for Raku without realizing it, and tends to get jealous whenever other girls such as Marika try to get close to him. During their Romeo and Juliet class play, she eventually realizes that she is genuinely in love with him. Her mother, Hana, is a powerful CEO in America.

<description>Onodera Kosaki is a kind and sweet classmate of Raku. She has a shoulder length dark brown hair and chestnut brown eyes. Although Raku has a major crush on her, she does not reveal that she has a similar crush on him. When Raku mentions his lost locket of his first love, she shows some interest as she secretly carries a potential key, however, when confronted about the key or being the first love, she lies and denies it in embarrassment. Although she works with her mother at a dessert shop, she turns out to be a terrible cook on her own. Surprisingly, whatever food she fashions looks good on the outside.

<description>Tsugumi is a hitwoman who was raised and trained by Claude of the Beehive Gangsters. Tsugumi is originally introduced as a guy who transfers to Chitoge`s class, and has orders to protect her from Raku, whom she thinks forced Chitoge into the relationship. She and Chitoge are childhood friends; she tries to keep a ten year old promise of becoming strong to protect Chitoge. However, after Raku treats her nicely, she begins to develop feelings for him, even though she is too stubborn and embarrassed to admit it. In America, her assassin code name is "Black Tiger", who had a rivalry with "White Fang" Paula McCoy. She does well academically, having ranked next to Chitoge on a yearly exam. Raku has occasionally confided with her as a good friend and also for romance advice.

<description>Shuu is Raku`s best friend; they have known each other since pre-school. He is the kind of person that would do anything for a laugh, and often makes perverted passes or comments without shame to his friends. He is also very perceptive, knowing immediately that Raku was not really dating Chitoge, that Raku and Onodera have secret crushes on each other, and that Tsugumi develops feelings for Raku. He uses this knowledge for his enjoyment. On academic rankings, he places next to his "glasses buddy" Ruri, much to the latter`s chagrin. He has not expressed romantic interest in Raku`s friends, but has expressed interest in their homeroom teacher Kyouko.

She does not get along with Chitoge; she states she hates girls with long hair despite the fact that she also has long hair. She has a frail constitution; ten years prior, she was frequently visited by a young Raku, who brought her gifts and sparked a friendship with her. She used to speak in a rather vulgar manner, but has attempted to correct her language after Raku had told her that he likes a girly girl with long hair. However, when flustered, she reverts to her old speaking habits.

<summary>In an attempt to finally get to school properly on time, Chitoge rushes, but along the way her precious ribbon is lost. She is inconsolable for several days as efforts by her and her friends to find it are unavailing, although Ichijou comments that he might like the gentler Chitoge better. Eventually, he decides to get her a similar ribbon and pass it off as the original, but she can tell that it is a new one. They see her real ribbon atop a telephone pole, but it flies off just as Chitoge tries to get it, and it is apparently destroyed by a passing train. But Ichijou tells her it was the fake ribbon, and hands her the real one, which flew away in a different direction. Her personality reverts to the old, violent one. She does, however, patch up even the fake ribbon.
Chitoge is reading a romance manga where she sees the main heroine confess her love. This makes her think of trying to do so to Ichijou, but she is unable to do so. She talks to her father about it was with him and her mother, and he tells her how effortless it had been. Later, as Chitoge is walking with Ichijou, he talks about how it had been more than a year since their strange arrangement began and how he`d like  to continue taking things slowly.</summary>

<summary>Onodera is taste-testing their family sweet shop`s products when Haru points out that she seems to be getting fat. Checking on the bathroom scale shows that this seems to be true. Terrified, she starts skipping meals and refusing even her favourite foods, making Ichijou deeply concerned for her. It is only after he tells her that she looks sick and is getting too thin that she stops worrying. It turns out that the scale was broken.
She later reminisces of the time just before graduating from middle school, of how she had a crush on Ichijou even then. She remembers how she tried to get into Bonyari High School as that was where Ichijou planned to go, so that she could continue to say `good morning` and `see you` to him every day. She ultimately failed the entrance exam, but got in in the end because a waiting list slot was freed up for her.</summary>
