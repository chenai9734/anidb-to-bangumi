<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="314894">Best anime of 2013. Master piece. Don`t miss it</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="360049">awesom!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="288423">Incredible anime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="63624">Are you sick of watching moeshit ?
Then this show will be a breath of fresh air for you.
Not recommended for those that can`t stand gore.
Finally a decent adaptation of a good shounen.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="302080">Absolutely breathtaking ..too bad the ending doesn`t really resolve anything. This would be an instant classic if the ending wasn`t so meh. The action is where it is at, though. Magnificent dizzying acrobatic setpieces that will have you rewinding key scenes time and again. Highly recommended.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="605483">If your looking for some action/fantasy from another made up place. This is the anime for you. Be warned there will be blood, and lot of death and gore. But other than that is a has a good solid story, a few comedy, and a ton of action.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="559673">This anime is a must see and anime like these came out very rarely... if you liked claymore , berserk and 12 kingdoms there is no way , you wont like it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="533051">too epic...just it</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="178631">Well, that was certainly something new. The main character is overly annoying but the series overall are worth watching.
Do recommend.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="77420">Great animation and soundtrack with an engaging storyline that keeps you hooked with the constant cliffhangers. Bad points are you sometimes feel you`re watching fillers (which I`ve found is true later on), characters pretty much don`t develop and there`s no ending as the manga is still ongoing (though it`s highly possible a sequel is going to be made).</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="497799">Filled with non stop action and suspense. I have watched up to episode 25 and I am sure it is not finished yet. Can`t till the next episodes air.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="83001">This series delivers intense action, but what makes it special is the courage in showing people`s ugly nature, unfairness and injustice, to the point where it`s actually asking if they are really worth saving.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="543137">great anime, great story love to watch it</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="135151">Took a few eps to get into it, but enjoyed it very much. Very unique ideas. Good story/mystery.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="650045">Same premise of "kill all the _____" and protecting Humanity.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="475822">The first 8 episodes or so are really great. The show moves quickly along the plot. Then it slows down almost as if they found out they were getting a second season or something. It literally takes 2 whole episodes to move from one event in the plot to the next. Reminds me of DBZ back in the day. That said it really is awesome.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="572395">I must admit ... its best anime i saw in my life
amazing and fascinating work .
must see this master piece</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="587854">I also think its a good anime so far, BUT anyway, it has it weaknesses. The drawing quality varies sometimes. Also often fixed pictures are used and the story itself is not thaaaat innovative. Monsters killed the parents of a little child, the child wants revenge and getting a soldier. Anyway, i want to see more. :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="388517">really good action anime...hope there is a 2nd season coming</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="465610">A nice story with interesting characters and cool animation seems promising and the manga is  epic!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="474005">this anime is off the hook. excellent design.animation and story..</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="210547">10/10 it goes in do not miss it..</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="632413">Really Awesome anime..

But watch out, this anime looks terrible for some people.

Don`t watch it if you afraid of bloody action</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="599448">As one of those people who watched it after the end of the season and had to endure months of hype i must say i was a little surpised. The graphic edge this was told to have seemed "weak". Disconcerting in a good way but nowhere near the hype. Nevertheless it is a must see for any anime fan.

It will glue you to your screen!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="1841">Really Awesome keeps me wanting more! @@</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="161106">It`s one of the more interesting show`s I`ve seen as of late. It`s fresh, I like most of the characters, the story and action is so far very intriguing. I don`t have an issue with the pacing but it`s definitely an anime that I wish would already be completed and stop at ~50 episodes. The episodes just vanish in a flash.

I wouldn`t call it a masterpiece so far, I`d give it the possibility to become one though but it all depends what direction it will take. So far it`s one of the shows I anticipate the most each week.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="239672">This series is really a suprice for me this season. It caught me right in the beginning.
The animationstyle, the story, everything. Every episode is special und the action und pressure gets up in every episode. You will always say WTF!?
This is noit a must see, its a have to see for every anime fan out there!
Highly recommend!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="273035">First anime that gived me that spark, all watched in 1 day. I rated it 10/10, it has all action, fight for those who are no longer, team fight to sacure future, survival for life, conspiracy (that plot is amazing), no mater what this is must see. Watch for you self.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="456503">This is seriously by far THE BEST anime of all time. I imagine the ratings for this show on anidb will eventually surpass Code Geass. I will be shocked and appauled if they do not. I put this show on par with Game of Thrones. People die in this anime. Lots of people. People you don`t want to die. Bad s*** happens, but hey: bad s*** happens in REAL LIFE too, it`s unavoidable. This is about the human struggle and the tradegy that comes with it. Words cannot begin to describe the feels I feel when I watch this show. Dem feels bro...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="278873">Must watch!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="631134">One of the most breathtaking and thought-provoking anime I`ve seen in a long time. No wonder it has grown such a fan-base. This will leave you hanging at the edge of your seat! After ep.7, you`re in for one hell of a ride. Must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="215116">Holy Hell !!!

There can`t be a better action anime than this
Must See !!!

Its an awesome setting , with great characters and character development

JUST DON`T MISS IT !!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="307712">Inspired by Muv-Luv series (EXTRA, Unlimited, Alternative - visual novels)

Perfectly matches the manga using chronological order. First thing to understand is the characters are YOUNG and INEXPERIENCED, the manga brings fully-fledged and powerful characters in much later chapters. So complaining about inexperienced combatants is a laugh. The other point is knowing someone for few minutes, hours, or days then they die so fast. The `dying` part plays such a huge role on all minor and secondary characters. The anime ends around chapter 33 in the manga so the drama isn`t explained well like in the manga (more anime seasons will becoming). If I have to point out one thing to people, google this:

Nightcore - Reluctant Heroes

Listen to the lyrics. Very clear voice and excellent emotions invoked into the song describing the characters` inner feelings across everything when they`re on the thin thread of life and death.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="758856">There`s a lot waiting for anime watchers and it gets so good. By the end of the story you`ll feel so conflicted. Explores into such higher dimensions of morality.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="589888">- Good storyline: Inspiring, heart-moving; blood-pumping... Its a type of anime that`ll just sucks you into it. 
- Best drawings and animations i`ve seen: Its because of the drawing that did so much efforts in expressing the utmost feelings of the characters, and maintain the actions at the top of its climax.
- Good character development: So much feels. Unbelievable depth for such an action-fantasy anime. Also, the character`s expressions are REALISTIC. It describes people`s true feeling in total despair, and the never-ending hope of humanity in that despairness.
- Extremely good music and soundtracks: What more can i say ?
- Overall, i`d like to give this a 9/10. The storyline can be really predictable sometimes, but i wouldn`t recommend you sitting there watching the anime with a speculating posture; it`s best to just sit back, relax and enjoy the anime. If you`re into fantasy, gore/thrill with a lil romance, this anime sure wont let you down</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="246107">If you like Gundam UC, Berserk, and Fist of North star , you should watch this anime. I guarantee 100% you will like it.
If you like lame shoujou, gymnastic , loli, boring long-winded conversation kind of anime, then this anime is not for you. It is as simple as that. 
Different anime appeals to different type of otaku.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="575638">awesome storyline and graphics.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="494655">If you are tired of non-sense ecchi and predictable shonens: Watch this. Definitely the best of the year. I totally recomend it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="41593">This is indeed a must see, this anime, is a master piece so far. will get you bonded to your screen.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="461913">lots of junk out their no good story bad animation this has a good story has originality  good animation great action scenes character development is not to draw out it comes to gather nice all and i give it a 9 out of 10 defiantly a must see best stuff i have seen in awhile</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="248562">Hands down the most interesting and well-done anime I`ve ever seen! You`ll be chewing at your fingers just to see what comes next! Amazing in every aspect - animation, music, acting, story ... everything :) Epic and full of surprises! Watch it!! :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="13780">Break Throw Achievement in this anime.
You will see Gore, Story and Passion!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="464392">Finally something that can be called a MUST SEE. There is no need for details just watch the first episode and get caught in the flow like i did!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="556870">My first ever recommendation.
I felt others have always said what was needed on other shows, so I just rate.
But this show.
While yet again others have spoken before me, saying words that I might say myself, I just need to speak out for this show.
It is far and beyond anything I expected of it, and it continues to surprise me at only 6 episodes in.
The characters, the world, the enemy, the story and potential story, nothing has grabbed me like this in a long time.
Bouncing on my seat in exciting. Jaw dropping at amazing sights and actions. Smiles all round at the carefully placed humor. Tears, tears at the tragedy of the people of this world.
A masterpiece of an anime. A masterpiece among, and comparably, to any other great stories in media.
I hope that all goes well as this continues. That they dont mess it up with some weird Dues Machina plot device.
But as for now, a MUST see.
Dare I say, perfect.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="248649">That was the best anime of this year.
Everything in this anime is at the top level.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="586352">Been a loooong time since I started watching an anime that gripped me from the very first episode. 
From that one devastating scene that changes Eren`s life, you connect with him, and you want him to kill every last Titan.
The animation and facial expressions on him, especially his eyes, make you really feel for him.
Truly gripping, and I can`t wait for the next episode.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="360204">Can`t describe this as anything other than "must see."</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="621681">I am completely addicted!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="239259">i didnt enjoy watching anime since long time, specially with the latest anime mainly fan service nothing more, but this one is the best since the last 2 or 3 years as i recall, from animation to story to sound track, everything is almost excellent, must see for sure</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="307450">After episode 5 i was ``forced`` to read the manga and beleave me it goes even better :)
An absolute master piece.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="177141">Yeah, if you`re a seinen fan, yeah, 
it really is that good.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="301941">Watch it. This is simply awesome. People dying, twisted story and more :P</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="161249">Great story with superb art!  I loved it from start to finish!  The only downside will be the long wait for the second season to come out.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="38231">The story is so unforgiving. It`s heartbreaking and fearsome how much this gets under your skin. I`ve waited ages to get something like this just sucks you in! Don`t make the error and miss on this one!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="403846">No doubt the best anime of 2013 so far. And it keeps getting better and better.

The cover on anidb is lame tho.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="229307">One of the best anime so far .
you have to see it to understand what i mean

my rating is &amp;gt; 10\10  Without questions

In another word, you can`t miss this one, no matter what kind of anime you like.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="269108">For me it`s the best anime I`ve seen for a long time :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="357099">Stunning animation and soundtracks, a breathtaking and well-developed plot packed with action and scenes so tense they`ll make you sit on the edge of your chair. With it`s loveable characters and realisticly detailed universe, Attack on Titan can easily be considered as one of the best anime shows of the decade.
A must watch for fans of any type of anime.</recommendation>

<description>Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by titans. Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of titans.
Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy http://anidb.net/ch51115 [Eren] and his foster sister http://anidb.net/ch51116 [Mikasa] witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a super titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind.

Note: The last episode received a pre-airing in Tokyo, Marunouchi Piccadilly 1 theater. TV broadcast took place after midnight, a few hours later.</description>

<description>The military, also known as the armed forces, are forces authorized and legally entitled to use deadly force so as to support the interests of the state and its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its citizens and the prosecution of war against foreign powers. The military may also have additional functions within a society, including construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding critical areas.

<description>Untrained and as yet immature, children are expediently thrust into the role of warriors to protect god, king, and country. Not having even finished school, they are inexplicably designated to elite status or roles, typically requiring months of training and years of experience. All the more so with "experimental" equipment or weapons of mass destruction.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>steampunk</name>
<description>Steampunk is a sub-genre of science fiction that typically features steam-powered machinery, especially in a setting inspired by industrialized Western civilization during the 19th century. Steampunk works are often set in an alternative history of the 19th century`s British Victorian era or American "Wild West", in a post-apocalyptic future during which steam power has regained mainstream use, or in a fantasy world that similarly employs steam power.
Noteworthy attributes of the theme include large amounts smoke pollution from wood or coal burning, the affinity to metal constructs like cogs and metal tubing, and the mechanization of everyday objects.
Steampunk perhaps most recognisably features anachronistic technologies or retro-futuristic inventions as people in the 19th century might have envisioned them, and is likewise rooted in the era`s perspective on fashion, culture, architectural style, and art.
Such technology may include fictional machines like those found in the works of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, or the modern authors Philip Pullman, Scott Westerfeld, Stephen Hunt and China Miéville. Other examples of steampunk contain alternative history-style presentations of such technology as lighter-than-air airships, analog computers, or such digital mechanical computers as Charles Babbage`s Analytical Engine.
Steampunk can also exemplify everything that is bad about unrestrained technological progress (dead matter), when compared to life and nature. The anime usually makes a point to propound the latter.

<name>post-apocalyptic</name>
<description>An anime that takes place on future Earth (or it could be an alternative universe) after a major cataclysm has occurred. World War III, an alien invasion, plague, global warming or some other general disaster are common themes to build a post-apocalyptic world upon, where the effects were severe enough that mankind barely survived.
The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologised). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in an agrarian, non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of technology remain. There is a considerable degree of blurring between post-apocalyptic fiction and that which deals with false utopias or dystopian societies.</description>

<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<name>footage reuse</name>
<description>Footage reuse is the employment of a sequence of frames many times, generally as a side effect of a constrained anime production budget. This can happen by using the same footage once at a time, but many times over the course of the show, or by directly looping it. Types of scenes that tend to get reused include: transformations, such as those typical of superheroes or magical girls, characters that change into powered-up versions of themselves, or robots changing shape; attacks, especially when involving a series of steps that must be followed before the attack can be launched; and any kind of action that involves repeating the same movement.
This tag does not apply if the footage changes significantly between iterations. An example of that is the infamous Endless Eight arc of http://anidb.net/a6367 [the 2009 iteration of Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu]; even as the plot repeated itself, each episode of the arc showed it in different ways.</description>

<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<name>ensemble cast</name>
<description>A show with an ensemble cast focuses on a larger group of main characters in a single plot narrative; anime containing several segmented plot narratives (such as episodic or arc-based plots) are excluded. As such, it doesn`t really have a "main" or "lead" character; instead, every member of the central main character group plays an important part in the show`s grander scheme; no single character is more important or prominent than the others (equality of importance). Further, subplots (if any) lead by each character in the ensemble have equal weighting in importance (or lack of weight).

* In a show where no single main character is more important or prominent than the others, 4+ main characters is almost always an ensemble cast.
* A show with 3 main characters of equal importance is likely also an ensemble cast; equality of importance must be considered carefully.
* A show with 2 main characters of equal importance is generally not an ensemble cast situation; however, on an exception basis where neither main character is considered an antagonist, a 2-main-character anime may be considered an ensemble (e.g. http://anidb.net/a11829 [Kimi no Na wa.]).

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<description>"In order to save the many, the few will need to sacrifice their lives..." or so this character may think. 
In a seemingly hopeless situation, against impossible odds, the character does not choose the path of the coward and run, he or she chooses to bravely face the enemy, fully aware that this will mean death.</description>

<name>Eren Yeager</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Eren Yeager is Shingeki`s protagonist. His adoptive sister, Mikasa, notes on numerous occasions that he acts on impulse without thinking things through, and she often pulls/carries/throws him when he starts fighting with others to protect him from himself. Along with Mikasa, he tends to spend his free time with their mutual friend, Armin.
When Eren was a child, he saved Mikasa from being killed when visiting her home with his father. Three men - killers of her parents - were in her house, and he killed two of them--one by slitting his throat and the other by charging at with a quickly assembled spear. Mikasa herself killed the third man when he attempted to strangle Eren. After this, he gave Mikasa his scarf and took her into his family.
Later, when the giants invaded his home, he could only watch on as his mother - trapped under the rubble of their house - was eaten by a giant. This event made him swear that he`d kill every giant and not live a life cowering in fear.
Sometime after this - before the timeskip that jumped a few years ahead, to when he became a soldier - his father injected him with something. It`s unknown what at this time but it turns out, because of the injection, Eren can regenerate lost limbs and transform into a somewhat out of control giant.</description>

<name>Mikasa Ackerman</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Mikasa Ackerman is the adoptive sister of Eren and mutual childhood friend of Armin, Mikasa hides her emotions but cares deeply for Eren--never hesitating to cry with tears of joy or despair depending on what happens to him. She shares an unbreakable bond with Eren following events in their past, and his mother requesting that she protect him made her even more overly protective of him than she was beforehand.
Subtle (and not-so-subtle) hints throughout the manga suggest she loves Eren as a man, rather than as a brother. However, in the first four volumes he hasn`t shown any such feelings in return; while he does show hints indicating he cares for her, it is still not known if it is as his sister or as a woman.
When Mikasa`s parents were murdered, and she was tied-up on the floor, Eren saved her life - when visiting by chance with his father - by killing two of the three men who killed her parents, in spite of him only being a child at the time. And then, when the third man was strangling a helpless Eren after catching him off-guard, she picked up a knife off the floor and stabbed the man in the back; killing him.
Afterward, Eren gave Mikasa his scarf - which, even many years later, she still wears - and made sure she understood that he, and his parents, were now her family. Because of his heroics and this gesture, she feels her life is Eren`s now, because - in her mind - she already died once.</description>

He is highly competent at the three dimensional maneuver and highly skilled at efficiently using it. Good at asserting his situation at any given time, but is far too quick to unsheathe his sword. He is also prone to sparking conflict.

She later develops a fear of facing the Titans and spends much of her time around Ymir.
