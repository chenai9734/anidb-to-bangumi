<description>* Based on a shounen manga by http://anidb.net/cr860 [Akamatsu Ken], serialised in http://anidb.net/cr17160 [Shounen Magazine].
Some time after http://anidb.net/ch4657 [Negi]`s first year as a teacher, Class 2-A goes on a school trip to a beautiful island for spring break. Everything seems fine now, but the troubles continue for Negi, since he is still the centre of attention in class. But he has something else to worry about, http://anidb.net/ch4680 [Asuna] is angry at him because he told her that she has nothing to do with his studies as a wizard. During the trip, the situation gets very much more complicated when Asuna`s friends try to help Negi make up with her.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>school life</name>
<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<name>season</name>
<description>A season is a division of the year, marked by changes in weather, ecology, and hours of daylight. Seasons result from the yearly orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth`s rotational axis relative to the plane of the orbit. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth`s surface, variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.
During May, June, and July, the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun. The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December, January, and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere.
In temperate and subpolar regions, four calendar-based seasons (with their adjectives) are generally recognized: spring (vernal), summer (estival), autumn (autumnal), fall and winter (hibernal). Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring (prevernal) and late summer (serotinal) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four.

<name>spring</name>
<description>During spring, the axis of the Earth is increasing its tilt relative to the Sun, and the length of daylight rapidly increases for the relevant hemisphere. The hemisphere begins to warm significantly causing new plant growth to spring forth, giving the season its name. Snow, if a normal part of winter, begins to melt, and streams swell with runoff. Frosts, if a normal part of winter, become less severe. In climates that have no snow and rare frosts, the air and ground temperatures increase more rapidly. Many flowering plants bloom this time of year, in a long succession sometimes beginning when snow is still on the ground, continuing into early summer. In normally snowless areas spring may begin as early as February (Northern Hemisphere) heralded by the blooming of deciduous magnolias, cherries and quince, or August (Southern Hemisphere) in the same way. Many temperate areas have a dry spring, and wet autumn (fall), which brings about flowering in this season more consistent with the need for water as well as warmth. Subarctic areas may not experience spring at all until May or even June.

A soft-spoken and kind lad, Negi wants to do well in his new position and he just might if he can quit crossing hot-headed rabble-rouser Asuna. He`s still got some kinks to work out in his spell casting and his lesson plan, but Negi`s a good kid with a great heart. Most of the girls instantly take to him, though he may need to keep some distance. And if any of the students find out about his wizardly training, he`ll be transformed into a furry ermine!</description>

<description>Negi`s friends come in all shapes and sizes, occasionally even small, furry, foul mouthed, with a cigarette habit and a penchant for panty stealing! The little white weasel is invaluable as a confidant to Springfield, and Chamo is an integral part of some of Negi`s biggest battles and plans. Chamo spends a lot of time prodding the lad into pactios with the girls in 2-A. Of course, since the magic spells involve the young sorcerer getting a kiss, you can never really tell if Chamo is trying to help strengthen Negi`s chances as a warrior or if he`s just trying to get Springfield some romance in his life. Knowing Chamo, it`s probably both!</description>

Her misfortunes seem to stack up when the kid is around, and her hostility and suspicion toward the brainy boy lead her to a startling discovery! She soon finds Negi`s destiny in her hands.

Something is stirring in the quiet girl, though! something she cannot explain. Whatever these odd feelings, they are tied to Negi; if the lass could ever untie her tongue, perhaps a special relationship with the little magi awaits!</description>

<description>It`s the quiet ones you have to watch out for and intense Setsuna Sakurazaki is definitely a girl worth keeping an eye on. A childhood friend of class sweetie Konoka, Sakurazaki has been forcing distance between the former buddies and Konoka can`t figure out why. While on a class trip to Kyoto, Negi begins to suspect that not all is what it seems with Setsuna. It seems the girl is privy to some very secret knowledge. A kendo expert and apparent magic user as sharp and lethal as a polished blade, Setsuna lurks in the shadows for a reason! and when Konoka is attacked, Sakurazaki is obviously involved! Will she turn out to be a trusted ally or a dangerous foe?</description>

Although interested in cute things such as teacher Negi Springfield, her encounters with him lead her to become connected to various magical and supernatural phenomenon without truly knowing anything going on. Her connections with Negi also drive her into occasional confrontations with fellow Negiholic Ayaka Yukihiro.</description>

She is a skinflint, and does not readily spend money unless she has to, or if there is a way to get a discount. She is also a mercenary, and mostly takes on contracts that pertain to hunting/destroying/exorcising demons and ghosts but will take on any job as long as she is paid well.</description>

<description>When Negi retreats to the woods to gather his thoughts after a shocking confrontation with one of his students, the little magi is surprised to run into yet another of his charges, Kaede Nagase! Exuding a Zen-like calm and a maturity well beyond her years (not just because of her much discussed bust!), Kaede spends her free time training in the forested mountains. Exactly what she is training for, she will not tell. But at least she`s good at keeping information under wraps, because she soon figures out Negi`s magical secret! With Kaede`s wisdom and guidance, Negi may just be able to grasp some hidden truths! Springfield may be the teacher, but Kaede is responsible for the lessons today.</description>

<description>The prankster twins Fuka and Fumika are some of the smallest and, frankly, most immature girls in 2-A. Their youthful nature might be the reason that the duo get along with Negi so well. After setting a booby trap on Springfield`s first day as a teacher, the Narutaki twins set quite a precedent of unpredictability for the lad. Fans of loooooong campus tours as members of Mahora`s Walking Club, you can often find the twins goofing around with their friend Kaede. Fumika tends to go along with her older and more outspoken sister Fuka`s plans, but make no mistake! Both of these girls are capable of trouble!</description>

When Chisame retires to her room and whips off the nerdy glasses, she leads a surprising double-life as the legendary net idol Chiu! Using her computer smarts and web savvy, Chisame rides a wave of sexy costumes and online journals to the #1 spot in internet popularity polls! That is, until a group of cute and fresh contenders makes quite a stir with their new homepage!</description>

Ayaka`s lifelong rival Asuna knows her secret and surprisingly takes steps to bring some joy into the blonde`s life. Of course, that joy also comes with a visit from a rambunctious group of junior high girls who end up wreaking havoc at her fancy home.

<description>A gentle cook. She enjoys cooking and is in the cooking club.

A very nice and hard-working person, Satsuki is liked by everyone in Mahora, even Evangeline (who sees the rest of the class as a pack of air-headed beasts) and Nitta (who views the middle school students, especially the ones from 3-A, as rowdy kids who need to be disciplined at all times). Her very presence creates an atmosphere of serenity, and she can quickly put a stop to fights even between the hot-headed students in the High School and University martial arts clubs. Satsuki`s dream is to have her own restaurant, as she likes making people happy through her food.</description>
