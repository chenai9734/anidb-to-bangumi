<name>pirate</name>
<description>Pirates are people who attack ships on the high seas to rob others of their treasure. Well, at least usually. Other people calling themselves pirates are not unheard of, usually focusing on the freedom and romance involved in the piracy-related tropes and cliches. They may or may not be after the One Piece or a spaceship full of diamonds, too, if that`s what they see as treasure. Real-life pirates were extremely common a few centuries ago, and countries even sponsored their own pirates, called "privateers", to attack ships with flags of other countries. Nowadays, however, very few actual pirates still exist, and they rely more on terrorism and guerrilla warfare than anything else, demanding ransom in exchange for hostages instead of openly attacking the enemies with their swords. Another, more modern meaning for the word refers to people who illegally download copyrighted works they are not entitled to have a copy of. Be whichever it may, there are pirates around here. Arr, avast! Thar be pirates in these dark waters, matey!</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>An anime that takes place in an alternative past is an anime that clearly does not belong to the future or the present, and isn`t tied particularly closely to our history, or has ties to our history but only as a premise: there are too many things that don`t make sense for the time-period. In some cases there is futuristic technology present, but the overall setting still feels that of the past. However the setting must still take place on Earth, since we can not know if the history of a fantasy world is an alternate one or not.</description>

<name>Bakumatsu - Meiji Period</name>
<description>"Bakumatsu" (幕末, "Late Tokugawa Shogunate") occurred between 1853 and 1867 during which Japan ended its isolationist foreign policy and modernized from a feudal shogunate to the Meiji government. Bakumatsu represents the final years of the Edo period (when the Tokugawa shogunate ended) and preceded the Meiji era. The primary historical significance of Bakumatsu was the conflict between the pro-imperialist "Ishin Shishi" ("nationalist patriots"), and the shogunate forces, including the elite Shinsengumi ("New Selected Corps").
The Meiji Era (including Meiji Restoration) denotes the 45-year reign of Emperor Meiji, running from 23 October 1868 to 30 July 1912. During this time, Japan started its modernization and rose to world power status.
Be aware that this category should only be assigned to anime that take place in Japan during the years mentioned above, and not to every anime that has samurai in it.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>Asia is Earth`s largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometers, about 30% of Earth`s total land area and 8.7% of the Earth`s total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

<name>parallel world</name>
<description>A parallel world, parallel universe, or alternative reality is a self-contained separate reality coexisting with our own. Because "alternative reality" sometimes implies that the reality is a variant of our own, like for example a mirror world, we use the term "parallel world/universe" which is more general, without any connotations implying a relationship (or lack thereof) with our own world/universe (meaning a fictional world can just as well have an alternative reality, it doesn`t need to be our reality). To put it more simply, this category is to show if more than 1 world/universe/reality is present in the anime.
Multiple timelines of the same world/universe/reality are NOT considered parallel worlds. For example, in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate] the cast travels through multiple "World Lines", which are defined as parallel timelines of the same universe had various events occurred with differing outcomes.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>alcohol</name>
<description>Alcohol (or more scientifically, ethanol), is one of the world`s oldest psychoactive substances. It is traditionally found in the form of a beverage such as beer, wine, or liquor, although in some contexts it can be inhaled to produce similar or intoxication, and some people prefer another way of consuming beverage-form alcohol.
Alcoholic beverages are many and varied, due to production methods (fermentation or distillation), source materials (grains, fruits, vegetables, other plants), added substances such as flavorings, and many more ways of defining different forms of alcoholic beverages.
Alcoholic beverages are divided into three general classes: beers, wines, and spirits. They are legally consumed in most countries, and over 100 countries have laws regulating their production, sale, and consumption. In particular, such laws specify the minimum age at which a person may legally buy or drink them. This minimum age varies between 16 and 25 years, depending upon the country and the type of drink. Most nations set it at 18 years of age.</description>

<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<description>Important characters will have a terrible tendency to die dramatically, but will not, under any circumstances, stay dead. This tends to cheapen the dramatic death of a character to the point of being little more than a flesh wound if overused. If you ever hear passing mention of any form of afterlife in a series, be warned that the value of "dead" has become a whole lot less all of a sudden. Similarly, if the entire supporting cast is being killed off left and right, expect a resurrection by the end of the current arc. This trope became so common in some series that most people are more likely to be shocked if a character does not come back from the dead than when it does.</description>

<description>A gang is a group of people, through the organization, formation, and establishment of an assemblage, share a common identity. In current usage it typically denotes a criminal organization or else a criminal affiliation. In early usage, the word gang referred to a group of workmen. In the United Kingdom the word is still often used in this sense, but it later underwent pejoration. The word gang often carries a negative connotation; however, within a gang which defines itself in opposition to mainstream norms, members may adopt the phrase as a statement of identity or defiance.
The word "gang" derives from the past participle of Old English gan "to go". It is cognate with Old Norse gangr, meaning "journey."</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Sakata Gintoki is the main character of the story. He has naturally permed hair, which he blames for his lack of a love-life. He rides a motor scooter and wields a bokuto, which has "Lake Touya" inscribed on it. His job, as is written on his business card, is a "free-lancer", meaning he`ll take any job for nearly any price. He enjoys reading http://anidb.net/cr5372 [Shounen Jump] comics and he has a sweet tooth and will go into crazed combat if he does not have his sweets (he has glycosuria).
In the past, he was a Joui (someone who attempted to overthrow Amanto to protect the government). The reason Gintoki does not join http://anidb.net/ch1165 [Katsura Kotarou] again to fight the aliens is that he does not like to fight alongside "gloomy terrorists".</description>

<description>Shinpachi Shimura works under Gintoki to learn the ways of the samurai. He used to stay at his family`s doujo. However, it seems more like he`s just trying to help Gintoki pay the rent than to learn. Shinpachi is the captain of the "Otsu`s Imperial Guard," a pop-singer`s fan club, and takes his role seriously. Other members of the fan club treat him with utmost respect, something he isn`t treated with usually.</description>

<name>Kagura</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Although she appears to be a normal, cute, human girl in Chinese-style clothing, she actually belongs to the Yato Clan, one of the strongest and most bloodthirsty of the Amanto races, although Kagura rejects that part of herself. The Yato are said to have "transparent" (snow-white) skin that is highly sensitive to sunlight, so Kagura carries a purple parasol at all times. The parasol is also the Yato clan`s weapon of choice; Kagura`s is bulletproof and fires bullets from its tip. Because of her Yato blood, she is super-strong and can stop a speeding motorscooter with one hand. Although stronger than most humans, she cannot control her strength perfectly. Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu, have met with an untimely demise by her hands.</description>

<description>Katsura is Gintoki`s former comrade during the Joi war. Even after the Amanto take-over of Japan, Katsura continues to resist the Amanto, and has amassed a band of followers. His weapon of choice is a metallic grenade. He is a wanted man due to his involvement in terrorist activities against the Bakufu, and is constantly on the run from the Shinsengumi.
[spoiler="Very late Gintama spoiler."]Although his initial methods were originally more violent in nature (for instance, sending a bomb to an Amanto embassy), Katsura has gradually grown to believe that there are people important to him in Edo, and decides that he no longer wants to destroy the country, but believes there should be a way to change it without causing sacrifices.[/spoiler]</description>

Elizabeth was a present from Tatsuma Sakamoto, who presumably picked it up on his travels around space. Although many people consider Elizabeth to be insane and extraneous, Katsura has named the ambiguous avian "Elizabeth" and dotes on it. While it appears to be just one being, Shinpachi purchased a doll named Space Alien Stefan to which looks perfectly similar to Elizabeth. Elizabeth is something of a painter, and is surprisingly dexterous. Also, Elizabeth resorts to using signboards to "communicate", as well as an occasional means of attack. Elizabeth is also a skilled fighter, able to use signboards to fight off swordsmen.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The vice-commander of the Shinsengumi. Toushirou Hijikata is the famed chain smoking (he has hardly shown up on the screen without a cigarette in his mouth), "demon" vice commander of the Shinsengumi so named by his subordinates, because of his fearsome demeanor and also, possibly, his unsettling tendency to pile mayonnaise on anything and everything he eats. Purportedly the brains behind the force, he takes his work seriously, and is fiercely loyal to his leader, Kondo. Hijikata has a reputation as a fearsome leader, earning the nickname of "demonic vice-commander". He is also hot-tempered and often speaks of seppuku. However, despite his cold exterior, he does have a more compassionate side. He also has a tendency to cry after watching movies that aren`t particularly emotional, as demonstrated after he admits to crying during "Alien Vs. Yakuza" and breaks down weeping during "My Neighbor Pedoro." He also seems to care for Okita`s sister and is willing to sacrifice his life to protect her. These feelings, however, are usually kept bottled up and kept behind a mask of nonchalance, because he believes that with the life of violence that he lives, he will not be able to provide happiness for her.</description>

<description>Okita is the best swordsman in the Shinsengumi. Personality-wise, he tends to be light-hearted and somewhat childish, not entirely unlike Kagura, though his speech is heavily deadpan. The rest of his character can be inferred from the following conversation between Kondou and Hijikata: Kondou asks Hijikata to stop Okita "before he becomes a sadist", Hijikata responds with "No, it`s too late. He`s the King of the Planet of Sadists".</description>

<description>Despite her sweet face, she is one of the most violent characters in Gin Tama (and arguably strongest too). She mercilessly beats up Kondo Isao and Gintoki whenever they anger her; in episode 19, she mercilessly kicks the men out onto the road (namely her brother, Gintoki, Hasegawa and Sadaharu) so as to stop a car for a hitch ride. She often displays her trademark sweet-looking smile with her eyes closed before engaging in her violent activities. Her killer intent is so strong that on one occasion, a stare from her brings the entire Shinsengumi on their knees begging for mercy. Her weapon of choice seems to be a naginata, a Japanese spear.</description>

<description>A female ninja nicknamed Sacchan, supposedly from the Oniwabanshuu. She is severely short-sighted and often loses her glasses to hilarious - or disastrous - effect. She met Gintoki when she fell through his roof. When she tried to convince him that he had inappropriate relations with her, he briefly played along despite knowing that she was lying to get his help. Ever since that incident, she has become infatuated with him, much to his exasperation. Her feelings for him seem to be encouraged, as she enjoys being put down and threatened by him, due to her extreme masochism. Her attacks are mostly based on natto and bondage. She often follows Gintoki and the rest of Yorozuya around much to his knowledge, throwing objects at her to come out when he needs her help. She cannot stand Zenzo Hattori, her former Oniwaban comrade, and has "attacked" him at his "weak point" (his haemorrhoids) by shoving in an enormous syringe, wooden barbecue stick and a candle.</description>

Her talent was recognized by Bansai Kawakami (under his producer alias "Tsunpo"), and she has since gained popularity. Her mother manages her, and her father is currently serving time in prison. When she was younger, her father made a bet with her, saying that if she became famous, he would bring a number of roses to her first concert. He broke out of prison specially for the occasion, and although he couldn`t give her the roses, he gave her a single flower. He donned a paper bag over his head, so he wouldn`t trouble her with his presence, yet she knew it was him, and thanked him with tears in her eyes.</description>

<description>Hasegawa used to be an official working for the Bakufu, but after an unfortunate incident with Amanto dignitary Prince Hata, whom he was assigned to serve and protect, his superior asked him to succumb to his shame and commit seppuku, hearing which he ran away from his quarters. He initially believed that humans should focus on appeasing the Amanto, but after his encounter with Gintoki, his mindset changed, which led to him punching Hata out, thus getting fired. Since then, he has been living a life of somewhat like a loser, getting fired almost every time he gets a new job, mostly due to the unfavourable look his sunglasses and goatee give him. No matter what, he refuses to remove his sunglasses because it`s the only thing he had left to remind him of his successful past. Although he does exchange the sunglasses for a decent pair of half-moon spectacles at one point, he goes back to wearing them after he decides that he is going to live out his life in the best way he can. He is constantly seen working various part-time jobs.</description>

<description>Sadaharu has the outward appearance of a giant dog, but is actually an inugami. He was originally owned by a pair of miko sisters (Ane and Mone). His inugami powers are awakened if he consumes both strawberries and milk at the same time. He was named by Kagura, after her first pet, a rabbit which she accidentally killed while having a nightmare. When sitting on his haunches, he is taller than most humans. He was left in front of Gintoki`s apartment in a box that had "To Mr. Freelancer" written on it. Sadaharu chomps on anything smaller than itself, such as Gintoki`s and other people`s heads. Kagura seems to be the only one who can control him, for she has immense strength, though he chomps on her occasionally. Though he was dangerous when Gintoki first received him, he has become quite tame in the later episodes. He even obeys Gintoki at certain points, and has helped the main characters in many occasions. After a certain period of time, even Gintoki (who originally did not want Sadaharu around) refused to abandon Sadaharu or give him back to the miko sisters.
Recently, Sadaharu has impressed a yakuza`s boss and receives permission to date his dog (whom Sadaharu himself has fallen in love for).</description>

He has a crush on Tae Shimura and stalks her, to which Otae responds with merciless beatings. His crush is apparently predicated on the fact that Otae answered yes when he asked if she would accept a man with hairy buttocks (which Kondo has). Some characters in the manga often call him a gorilla he once referred to himself as "Gorilla Hitman 13" (a play on Golgo 13) because he had been dumped by Otae thirteen times in that one year. He cosplayed as a rampant alien`s "mother" twice.</description>

<description>A former comrade of Gintoki and Katsura, and a major antagonist.

He is easily recognisable through his bandaged left eye, his colourful kimono, his eerie smile, and the pipe he is often seen smoking.
He, Gintoki, and Katsura studied in the same temple elementary school when they were children, and he fought with them against the Amanto invasion during the latter part of the Joui war. After the war ended, he vanished, and has since gained a dangerous reputation due to his assassination of many of the Bakufu`s main officers and his planning of a large-scale coup d`état. Before his first appearance in both the anime and the manga, he was mentioned to have fled Edo and to have been hiding in Kyoto, although it is unclear how long before this was.</description>

Gintoki often corrects him, citing that if he were named Kintoki, kin means gold (because `Kin` from `Kintoki` instead of `Gin` would make the title `Kintama`, which means `testicles` instead of `Gin Tama`, which means `silver soul`).
Despite his goofy nature, Sakamoto is actually a successful businessman in the galaxy. He believes that business is a way of protecting his country. He has a private, well-equipped defensive business fleet. He believes that sacrifices should be made for the good of the community, which is why he chose to abandon his comrades on Earth to travel into space. Sakamoto is shown to be skilled with a pistol in an anime episode. His name is based on the historical character Sakamoto Ryoma.</description>

<description>A highly skilled ninja who sports a light-brown/dark-blonde mop top and a goatee. Initially introduced as a cloaked ninja assisting in the fraudulent "Dreamcatcher" scheme, his first notable appearance was when he and Gintoki attempt to fight to the death over the last remaining issue of a Christmas Double Issue AKAMARU Jump. Like Sa-chan, he too was originally a member of the Oniwabanshuu. He is the first ninja in the series to apparently equal obsessive devotion to Jump. He apparently suffers from piles. He commands a freelance ninja team known as the "Shinobi 5." His father is said to be the strongest man in the Oniwabanshuu, and an instructor to many of his peers, including Sarutobi Ayame.</description>

<description>Prince Hata is a Squat-like, purple alien prince who is fond of animals. His fondness is not reciprocated, and one of his "pets" had even bitten his antenna off (it grew back later). He has an eccentric habit of collecting rare pets, but as he is incompetent in managing them, they often cause havoc in Edo. The Prince is often known as "Baka Ouji" (Stupid Prince) due to his simple-mindedness and lack of responsibility with his animal collection. He is a recurring character in the series. In the anime his appearance is usually followed by a Swiss-inspired theme song.</description>

<description>Hiraga Gengai is Kabuki District`s greatest mechanic. He is a grey-bearded almost-bald person who wears goggles.
His son`s death left him with a deep emotional scar, and Takasugi took advantage of that and used him. He makes ugly and crude machines and has a bad habit of telling important parts-of-a-messages later, which usually gets Gintoki mutilated. Now he is seen making machines and fixing Gintoki`s bike.</description>

<description>The Joi War was a ten-year war of resistance, fought by the Japanese people against the Amanto (alien) invaders, who invaded Japan and eventually coaxed the Tokugawa shogunate into co-operating with them. Gintoki and several of his former allies fought during the tail end of the war, which had ended by the beginning of the series. Yet even during the period of peace, the more persistent members of the Joi faction have continued to resist the government, by means of terrorism and guerilla warfare.</description>

<description>Kagura and Kamui`s father and one of the last members of the Yato clan. His wife is deceased. Like Kagura, he fights using an umbrella, but is also shown to be strong in his own right. He is one of the few characters able to overpower Kagura. He first appears when an alien appears and takes over the Terminal, helping the Yorozuya defeat the creature. It is revealed that he has a cybernetic arm due to his son claiming his original in battle.
After he leaves to travel the galaxy hunting aliens, he`s next heard from in the form of a letter. He tells Kagura that Sadaharu is also a monster they should get rid of. He becomes the leader of the "Principality" in the anime, recruited by a Char Aznable doppelganger. In the manga, he`s recruited by a Darth Vader lookalike.
Later in the manga and anime series, he also participated in a hair growing shampoo advertisement, of which the Yorozuya complained that the advertisement was too long.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Single-handedly brought up younger brother http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Okita Sougo] when their parents passed away while Sougo was still very young, Okita Mitsuba admitted herself that she pampered http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Sougo] until he is spoilt rotten, resulting in the aloof character that he is now. She took such great care of him that she neglected her own health and developed tuberculosis, and forfeited her own chance for marriage when she was of marriageable age. As a result, http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Sougo] respected her immensely, addressing her very respectfully as ane-ue (姉上) and using the formal courteous form boku (僕) to refer to himself when speaking to her. She in turn called http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Sougo] affectionately as sou-chan.
Mitsuba`s sickly condition deteriorated when she came to Edo to be with her husband-to-be http://anidb.net/ch12344 [Kuraba Touma], who unbeknown to her, was using her and http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Sougo] as pawns in order to `buy over` http://anidb.net/ch6221 [Shinsengumi] so as to allow his own illicit arms trade with http://anidb.net/ch6222 [Joui] extremists.
Sends http://anidb.net/ch6221 [Shinsengumi] tear-inducing extra-spicy senbei (flavoured rice crackers) every month.
Her last words to http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Sougo] before she passed away in Episode 87 were `You are the brother that I am so proud of`.
Though younger brother http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Okita Sougo] resembled her a lot superficially, character-wise they are exact opposite. Mitsuba is the archetypal virtuous female character, termed yamato nadeshiko (大和撫子) aka traditional feminine virtues of olden Japan, as well as the stereotype figure of bijin hakumei (美人薄命) aka the beautiful die young.
Loves to add spice to all the food she eats, fanaticism on par with http://anidb.net/ch1167 [Hijikata] and his mayonnaise. Adds tabasco sauce to chocolate parfait. Expressed her wish to follow http://anidb.net/ch1167 [Hijikata Toushirou] to Edo when they were still in Bushuu (武州), but was rejected by him, out of concern for her safety and happiness. Although it is revealed that http://anidb.net/ch1167 [Hijikata] does in fact love her, he feels that he is unable to give her happiness, that is why he treats her coldly.</description>

He is the son of Hitotsubashi Narinari, part of one of the three branches of the Tokugawa Family. The family had fallen from grace at the end of the Joui Wars when a relative of his lost a battle against the Joui. His father and their retainers were forced to climb back into the government while dodging potential assassination attempts from the leader of the Tokugawa Faction, http://anidb.net/ch53228 [Tokugawa Sadasada]. The shrewd Narinari groomed Nobunobu from birth to become the next Shogun. And ever since, Nobunobu and his faction gathered allies within and outside the government to wait for the chance to usurp Sadasada`s groomed successor, http://anidb.net/ch11860 [Tokugawa Shigeshige], of his position of Shogun.

<description>Utsuro is the founder and first leader of the http://anidb.net/ch87781 [Tenshouin Naraku] before http://anidb.net/ch53229 [Oboro] took his position. He is now part of the Tendoshu.
Utsuro was born containing a high amount of Altana within his body, granting him ageless immortality and high regenerative capabilities. Unfortunately, he was persecuted by a wary populace who continuously tried to kill him to no avail, leading to them becoming more fearful and greater attempts to kill him, sparking a vicious cycle. To cope with the constant suffering and death, Utsuro created multiple personalities. He was then placed in prison and forgotten about for decades until he was able to leave when his cell door rotted away. But at the same time, Utsuro`s other personalities took over their shared body and decided to kill people, partially as revenge and partially to strive to become human again. He continued being a serial killer until he was caught by the imperial government, who instead of executing him, decided to make him into an assassin, seeing his potential. So he formed and lead the Naraku for 500 years, continuing to slaughter and kill; yet along the way, developed a death wish.
The original personality watched in the background at his blood-thirsty personas and wanted to fight back and resist them. Thus he created another personality, http://anidb.net/ch12459 [Yoshida Shouyou]. Shouyou suppressed the other personalities, defected from Naraku, took in a child, and opened a school to teach children. It appeared that Shouyou succeeded in living a life without killing and death. Unfortunately with the Naraku searching for him and opening a ``unique`` school during the Joui Wars, it seemed inevitable that he will be found. Someone reveals his location to the Naraku, and he is arrested with his school destroyed. Before Shouyou was executed by http://anidb.net/ch1162 [Gintoki], the original personality decides to act and kills his other personalities, including Shouyou, to become the only mind in his body. He had decided to end all his personalities` suffering and accept that they will continue to suffer forever. So he concludes that he will end all suffering and emptiness.
Utsuro was then revived in front of his former Naraku subordinates, who never knew that their former master was an immortal being who had continuously lead them for centuries. Utsuro was taken to the Tendoushu where tests were run on him about his immortality and he tells the Amanto group about himself. In exchange for sharing his immortality to the Amanto group, he joins the group as a means to find a way to end his suffering.

<description>Katsulla, Not Corolla is http://anidb.net/ch1165 [Katsura Kotarou]`s guardian spirit. When he got in a traffic accident, his soul was split in two. One half entered a Corolla, and the other was bound to hell, but was given a ride to his body by the Corolla and safely made it through.
Ever since, he kept the spirit of the car around even after it went out of service, used it to escape in emergencies, and came to be known as "Runaway Kotarou". In return for that power, he would be put under the "Katsura, Not Zura" curse, meaning he had to always drag the Corolla around with his hair and abuse his hair roots too the limit.
