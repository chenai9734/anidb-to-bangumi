<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>The Immortal Ship Committee is a group of individuals aboard the Sidonia who are deemed essential to the ship`s mission and are kept alive indefinitely with biotechnology.
Starting about 600 years before the beginning of the story, the core members of the Immortal Ship Committee - Kobayashi, Hiyama, Saitou, and Ochiai - began taking drugs that made them immune to aging and disease. As time went on, more members were added to the Committee until, one hundred years before the storyline, there were 25 members of the Immortal Ship Committee. They were led by Kobayashi, and had the ultimate goal of delivering Sidonia to a safe and habitable star system.
While some members of the Immortal Ship Committee live in the flesh, most of them live inside mechanical shells that protect their bodies from the diseases of aging. These members are unnamed, but appear to be the actual committee (also called the Assembly) members that make decisions for Sidonia. Their real names are not given and they are referred to by numbers. The only visible portion of their body are their faces, which are covered by skeletal masks and hide their youthful appearance. Physically, the members of the Immortal Ship Committee look as if they were in their late twenties.
Fearing for the survival of Sidonia, they try to remove Captain Kobayashi from her position, with Member #5 presenting himself as the next captain. However, shortly after he does so, the clone Ochiai kills him and every other member of the committee present.
After the murder of the committee members, only six immortals remain on Sidonia.
