<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="415669">It was an interesting movie but I found it a bit weird how Brolly became so strong in that short battle. Still definitely worth watching for every fan of Dragon Ball.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="136010">This movie was amazing to watch but you need to have watched Dragonball Super as this movie is in the continuation. I really enjoyed the story of this movie because Broly now has an actual character. The animations are amazing and everything a dragonball fan can wish for. 

The only gripe I have with this movie is the soundtrack. Most of the time its on point but in the later stages of the movie you hear cheering of the fighters in the background, embedded in the music, which was just strange.

If you like shounen this movie is a must see.</recommendation>

<description>Some religions say that there is a supernatural being called God. Other religions say there is more than one god. A supernatural being is also sometimes called a deity. Many religions believe that a deity created everything that exists. In most religions, a god is believed to be immortal (cannot die), and to have powers to control nature far beyond the powers of humans.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<description>Space Travel usually refers going to space or travelling there with or without a spacecraft.

Since it isn`t possible to travel faster than light, most anime series involve some sort "sub-space travel mechanism" as a way to travel faster than light.</description>

<description>The anime will fit this category if some or all of the action takes place on another planet which is supposedly in the same universe as Earth, not a complete fantasy world; usually there has to be some concept of space travel.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

This anime`s main character is comparable to the gods themselves in terms of resistibility, strength and/or downright bad-assery.

<name>Beerus</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Beerus is the God of Destruction, an individual that`s been around for centuries having destroyed several planets, solar systems and races. Even the mighty saiyajin king Vegeta once bowed in terror infront of him. Beerus even sees Freezer as little more than a nuisance that was too far away to deal with.
Beerus spends most of his time either sleeping for decades at a time or traveling around the universe destroying planets, eating whatever people offer him or in general doing whatever he feels like doing.
Beerus might have a short temperament and with his title God of Destruction may sound quite evil but despite all this, he is not a bad guy in general but rather more of in the gray area, always honoring his words and not doing things unnecessarily.
He is currently the second strongest individual in the Dragonball world. http://anidb.net/ch9004 [Super Saiyajin 3 Gokuu] was nothing but a toy for him. Even after http://anidb.net/ch2103 [Gokuu] ascended to Super Saiyajin God and came back with an increased power, he still did not manage to push Beerus to fight at more than 60% of his full power.
Note: As is the case with most of the main cast from Dragonball, Beerus`s name is a pun. In this case, it`s two puns meshed into one. The original pun was on the word `virus` as scriptwriter, Watanabe Yuusuke, stated in an interview with DVD &amp; Blu-ray Magazine that he had written a scenario in which the God of Destruction was actually the one responsible for originally infecting the Saiyajins with evil. However, when Toriyama Akira stepped in and changed a great deal of the movie`s backstory, he thought Beerus`s name was a pun on the English word `beer` and then followed suit by naming http://anidb.net/ch53770 [Whis] (ウイス or uisu) after `whiskey`, another alcoholic beverage.</description>

<description>Freezer Gun is the organisation controlled a majority of Universe 7 at the peak of its power and serves as the primary antagonistic force of the first half of the Dragon Ball Z series. Freezer`s father, Cold Daio was the leader of the organisation prior to passing control over to his son.
The organisation employs and enslaves powerful races, such as the Saiyans, to take over suitable planets so that they can be sold to the highest bidders, or alternatively to destroy planets which are determined to be not financially viable. Freezer`s forces are equipped with scouters, portable computers mainly used to measure power levels, and wear standard-issue battle armor which usually have dual shoulder guards, matching gloves and Buuts, and some form of skirt armor or crotch guard.
Freezer himself does not really consider his soldiers as an army, looking at them more as a convenient group of followers. In reality, the soldiers follow him and his relatives out of fear, though some soldiers are known to be fiercely loyal to Freezer such as the Ginyu Force.

When Freezer took over the business from his father in 732, most of the soldiers came from Planet Vegeta. However, Freezer became fearful of the power of the saiyajin and worked to make the army less saiyajin reliant. In five years from his accession, he destroyed Planet Vegeta, and cutting the size of the army in half.
In 762, the army took heavy losses while fighting on Planet Namek for the Dragon Balls, but was ultimately defeated.
In 764, the army attempt to invade Planet Earth, which proved even more fatal, as Freezer and Cold Daio were slain. Hence the army has reduced to a rump under http://anidb.net/ch72561 [Sorbet].
In 779, the army had become a shadow of its former self, as many words had liberated themselves. Thus Sorbet made a desperate attempt to fix the empire by resurrecting Freezer with the help of the Dragon Balls. However, Freezer was disinterested in fixing his empire and instead set on wasting the remaining resources of the army in order to pursue vengeance; a decision which ended in his, Sorbet`s and the bulk of the army`s soldiers` deaths.
In 780, when Freezer was resurrected for the second time, with the guidance of http://anidb.net/ch105587 [Beriblu] and http://anidb.net/ch105586 [Kikono], he decided to rebuild the army.</description>
