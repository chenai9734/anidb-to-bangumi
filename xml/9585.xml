<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="312729">While it was great to see a little more of an expanded epilogue, and explanation of the hammer (that still wasn`t animated), I prefered how the series left the ending with yuki seeing the phone change and therefore leaving it upto imagination. Worth a watch for fans of the series only.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="594038">So yeah, if you are here i imagine that you have watched the series. I would say Mirai Nikki`s ending is quite of meh and it needed a more complete conclusion &amp; aftermath. That`s what you get with this OVA. So i would recommend watching it immediatly after the end of the series.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="609374">If you watched the original this is a must watch. It closes the main series while implying something pretty huge. [sploiler] Yukki and Yuno become one. possibly implying that at the end of the 3rd worlds time when Deus doesn`t pick an heir, that he picks both Yuuki and Yuno. [/spoiler]</recommendation>

<name>horny nosebleed</name>
<description>In Japanese media, healthy young men who have no other sexual outlet will often suffer nosebleeds upon seeing the naked female body, or even just a pair of well-filled panties.
The nosebleed is, of course, a visual shorthand/euphemism for sexual arousal. It is commonly interpreted that way for males and females, with little trickles of blood indicating mild arousal, and gushing fountains of blood indicating erection/extreme arousal in both sexes. It can also be interpreted as shorthand strictly for erections in males. In that case, when blood shoots from the nose explosively, and in ridiculous quantity, the implication would be an ejaculation.

<name>swimsuit</name>
<description>A swimsuit is one of several kinds of garments designed to be worn by people engaging in water-based activities or sports or during certain activities under sunlight. Most kinds of swimsuit reveal a large portion of the body surface area, but exceptions exist. The more revealing kinds may also be worn as undergarment in sports that require wetsuits, or when there is a need to display the body, as in the case of beauty pageants or bodybuilding contests.
There is a very wide range of styles of modern swimsuits, which vary in relation to body coverage and materials. The choice of style of swimsuit is dependent on current fashions, community standards of modesty, and plain personal preference. Swimsuits for men usually expose the chest, while those for women do not usually do so; however, many women prefer to engage in water or sun activities with their torso uncovered, in a practice commonly described as toplessness or topfreedom. Since the early twentieth century a naturist movement has developed in western countries that seeks a return to non-sexual nakedness when swimming and during other appropriate activities; in some places around the world, nude beaches have been set aside for people who choose to engage in normal beach activities in the nude, and such beaches may or may not enforce nudity onto their goers.
In anime, it is common for at least one episode to feature the characters in swimsuits, usually as an excuse for gratuitous fanservice; when that happens, the episode is usually labeled a pool or beach episode, after the place the characters went to. Swimsuits, and in particular one-piece swimsuits, are a very common fetish in Japan; while the reason for that is uncertain, a common folk explanation is the fact that boys throughout their entire adolescence are commonly exposed to their female classmates wearing them, in what might be called an experiment in sexual discovery waiting to happen.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<name>absurdist humour</name>
<description>Surreal humour, also known as absurdist humour, is a form of humour predicated on deliberate violations of causal reasoning, producing events and behaviours that are obviously illogical. Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, non-sequiturs, irrational or absurd situations, and expressions of nonsense.
The humour arises from a subversion of audience`s expectations, so that amusement is founded on unpredictability, separate from a logical analysis of the situation. Its appeal stems from the fact that the situation described is exceedingly ridiculous or unlikely.
On an analytical level, all jokes contain a certain amount of incongruity, but while regular jokes carry an incongruity that the audience accepts as compatible with expectations, absurd jokes are characterized by a disproportionate amount of it, with the punch line delivering a situation incompatible with the world as we know it and failing to resolve the matter in the audience`s eyes.

<name>large breasts</name>
<description>Large breasts are breasts a fair notch larger than average, as found in some adolescent girls or fully grown women; however, as anime has no upper limit to breast size, the definition applies somewhat differently. To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>

<name>violent retribution for accidental infringement</name>
<description>A comedy / slapstick element often found in Ecchi anime: The hilarity derives from spontaneous embarrassment, overreaction of the "victim" (girl), immediate retribution for a seemingly inappropriate act, and a sense of pity with the supposed "aggressor" (boy).
Typically a boy will - through no fault of his own - stumble into a girl, thus invading her personal space. In the process the boy may e.g. pull down her skirt, grab the girl`s breasts, or accidentally kiss her. Any level-headed girl would see the accident just for what it is. Not so the girl with an overly developed sense of modesty, and a thing for violence. She - often a tsundere - will clobber the boy with excessive brutality.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<description>Usually metaphorical. Sometimes literal. At times both!
Typically this refers to the fact that the story is set in a grim, dog eat dog milieu — for example a decaying city.
Often the characters are just doing what they need to do to survive, with little or no expectation that their lives can be better. And often characters may feel they do not have any real choice in what they do.
And yes, occasionally the setting is actually dark — be it night or perpetually heavy cloudy sky and rain. It all adds to the oppressive, hopeless feeling of the show.

Other marginally less used variants of this are the http://anidb.net/t3444 [onsen episode] and the http://anidb.net/t2830 [furo scene], used when it is too cold for a beach/pool episode.

<name>Amano Yukiteru</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Amano Yukiteru sees his own life as if he were a bystander. His "No Difference" diary reflects that attitude. In a detached, neutral tone, the diary records the future changes in his surroundings every couple of minutes. This gives Yukiteru timely, detailed entries of the future around him and is perhaps the one of the most accurate diaries revealed so far. Its major flaw is that nothing short of a DEAD END will make the diary record anything about Yukiteru himself.
Despite his severe lack of social skills, Yukiteru, nicknamed Yuki, is a fairly normal middle schooler who has gotten in way over his head in Deus`s survival game. He has been marked by Deus as the one who has triggered impossible events and great changes to occur in the future. For that same reason, he is also viewed by the other diary holders as being the most likely to win the game, and is therefore the most dangerous player who must be taken out. Yukiteru possesses remarkable accuracy in throwing darts, which he practices every morning with several dartboards in his room. He prefers to eliminate the other holders by destroying their diaries utilizing his darts instead of using the simpler method of outright killing them with sharp, pointy objects; possibly because he is one of the few people who is actually sane.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Uryuu Minene is the secondary female protagonist, the Ninth Diary user and the protagonist of the side-story manga, Future Diary: Mosaic. An infamous atheist terrorist, Minene is a young woman who has hatred against organised religion particular God. Her hatred of religion stems from her past when she and parents were traveling in a city in the Middle East but got caught in a battle, which is hinted between Israelis and Palestinians, where her parents were killed in the crossfire. Blaming God for her parents death, she leads a crusade of destruction against those associated with God. Minene got involved in the Diary game when after a failed assassination to kill a Catholic Cardinal, she tried to escape but almost fell to her death but was saved by Deus who gave her an offer to save her if she join his game. Minene`s diary is the Escape Diary, which will chart out the best course of actions for her to escape whenever she finds herself in a dangerous situation. While it means she can escape anything, it is not perfect as the diary can only tell her how to escape if there are favorably conditions that allow her any chance to escape.
Originally, she wants to win the game to destroy religion worldwide but later mellows out after befriending Yuki and his friends. While she began as an antagonist against Yuki, she later became his ally, becoming a big sister figure to him and both of them hold no animosity with each other despite Minene was responsible for the destruction and deaths at his school and Yuki was the one who blinded her left eye. </description>

<description>The Twelfth Diary user. Blind and insane, he is a vigilante who acts like a super sentai hero including wearing spandex and a large, round one eye mask. While claiming to be fighting for "Justice", his view of justice is very different as to him, justice is the one who wins. His tape recorder called the Justice Diary (正義日記 Seigi Nikki), has the ability to tell him what evil deeds that will happen in the future which range from normally criminal like plotting murder to the nonsensical like littering. Furthermore, his diary can hypnotize people by giving them illusions.
http://anidb.net/ch25306 [Yuno] kills him by decapitating him when he tried to kill http://anidb.net/ch36460 [Tsubaki] by suicide bombing.
A running gag with him is his real face is never seen, at one point going as far as to wear two separate bags on his head so as to continue hiding it even after having it removed.
He is named after the Roman god Pluto.

<name>Kasugano Tsubaki</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The Sixth Diary user. A frail girl with bad eye-sight, she is the leader of the Omekata cult (御目方教 Omekata Kyou) where she`s serves as the group priestess. The scroll she carries is actually her Future diary called the Clairvoyance Diary (千里眼日記 Senrigan Nikki) which allows her to read what her followers see. However, Tsubaki does not trust what her diary tells her because what her followers see may not be accurate and her fear of traitors from within.
Tsubaki is introduced afterhttp://anidb.net/ch25305 [Yuki], http://anidb.net/ch25306 [Yuno] and http://anidb.net/ch36462 [Keigo] are invited to her cult`s shrine to help deal with a Diary user who is disguising himself as one of her followers and planning to kill her in exchange she surrenders http://anidb.net/ch25307 [Minene] to them after her cult captured her. http://anidb.net/ch25305 [Yuki] agrees to help her due to her condition and Tsubaki`s claim she has no interests in winning the game much to http://anidb.net/ch25306 [Yuno]`s jealousy. When the Twelfth diary user Yomotsu takes action to kill Tsubaki by hypnotizing her followers, http://anidb.net/ch25305 [Yuki] and http://anidb.net/ch25306 [Yuno] protects her and kills Yomotsu. However, Tsubaki betrays everyone, revealing she was using http://anidb.net/ch25307 [Minene] as bait to lure them so she could trap and kill them and tells http://anidb.net/ch25305 [Yuki] that she lied about not being interested in the game as she wants win and end the world as she hates it.
The reason she hates the world was because when she was young, her parents who were the original leaders of the cult were killed in a car crash and she was made the priestess. However, the cult`s second-in-command wanted the members of the cult not to leave so he had Tsubaki trapped in a cage and allowed the male members of the cult to rape her as part of a "ritual". The rapes traumatized Tsubaki with the only thing keeping her sane was a ball given to her by her mother but when she loses it during one of the cult`s gang rapes, Tsubaki finally had enough and wanted the world to end for making her suffer. After http://anidb.net/ch25306 [Yuno] helps http://anidb.net/ch25305 [Yuki] escape by cutting off Tsubaki`s right hand, http://anidb.net/ch25305 [Yuki] goes into hiding until Tsubaki orders him to show himself or her cult will rape http://anidb.net/ch25306 [Yuno]. http://anidb.net/ch25305 [Yuki] charges into the room where Tsubaki and http://anidb.net/ch25306 [Yuno] are and distracts everyone by throwing a ball, the ball Tsubaki lost, into the air and throwing a dart at Tsubaki`s Future Diary. Before her death, Tsubaki cries it was unfair that her ball came back now when she needed it the most.
In Future Diary: Paradox, Aru, who replaces http://anidb.net/ch25305 [Yuki] as the First Diary user is ordered by Muru Muru to reenacted the events above but instead, Aru refuses and does things differently by having Ai and Orin help him distract Muru Muru and the Omekata cult so he can bring Tsubaki out of the cult`s shrine. With Aru, Tsubaki learns from his investigations that her parents were actually murdered by the cult`s second-in-command because her parents wanted to end the cult and give Tsubaki a normal life. Due to his kindness and him teaching her that despite what she had gone through, there was still some good in the world, Tsubaki falls in love with Aru.
She is named after Proserpina, the Roman goddess of the spring.</description>

<name>Houjou Reisuke</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The Fifth Diary user. Reisuke is a four year old boy who despite looking seemingly harmless, is very intelligent for his age and has a very diabolical mind. He sometimes speaks in third person with his hand puppets who talks with. Reisuke`s diary is the Hyper Vision Diary, a colouring book that gives a small summary of the activities that he will perform for the day. However, his diary only shows three entries for the day during the morning, noon, and night. Despite that, it has a certain advantage of giving Reisuke all three entries at the same time, which allows him ample time to carefully plot his next move, as well as some pictures drawn by him, giving him some source material other than writing.
Reisuke parents were members of the Omekata cult who both later committed mass suicide after the police raided their temple. However, Reisuke claims he never loved his parents since they neglected him and wants to win the game to be a "Super Elite" to prove he doesn`t need to depend on adults. But despite these claims, http://anidb.net/ch25307 [Minene] learned Reisuke did love his parents and was devastated when they died. After his parents` death, Reisuke is adopted by http://anidb.net/ch38711 [Mrs. Amano] as she was a friend of his father. Due to the fact http://anidb.net/ch25305 [Yuki] and http://anidb.net/ch25306 [Yuno] were responsible for the incident that led to the police raid at the Omekata temple, Reisuke plans to kill them first, holding them responsible for his parents` deaths yet at the same time, he grows fond of them in a uniquely sadistic way, even calling them big brother and big sister. He was then killed by a stab wound given by http://anidb.net/ch25306 [Yuno].
He is named after the Roman goddess Ceres.
