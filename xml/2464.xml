<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>elements</name>
<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Hayato was introduced to the world of Cyber Formula when by accident he became the registered driver of the Cyber Formula car Asurada, designed by his father while he recovered it from the hands of mercenaries. The Cyber System registers a unique user for the vehicle at the time of activation and the it would take a week to reformat the vehicle for another driver. This was not an option as the race was to be held much sooner. This forces the Sugo Grand Prix team to go with Hayato as the driver for the license race over the team`s driver at the time, Akira Hiyoshi. After earning his licence to compete in the Cyber Grand Prix, Hayato becomes the youngest driver to ever compete in the Grand Prix, at the time.
