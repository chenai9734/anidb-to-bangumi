<description>Pokémon or Pocket Monsters (often referred to as Pokemon: Gotta Catch Em All to distinguish it from the later series) tells the adventures of Ash Ketchum (Satoshi in the original Japanese version) as he travels through Kanto, the Orange Islands, and Johto to become the greatest Pokémon Master. For the English language release, Pokémon was split into four separate series spanning five seasons.
[Source: wikipedia]
A young boy named Ash Ketchum embarks on a journey to become a "Pokemon Master" with his first Pokemon, Pikachu. Joining him on his travels are Brock, a girl-obsessed Rock Pokemon Trainer, and Misty, a tomboyish Water Pokemon Trainer who may have a crush on him. Ash and Co. end up traveling through various regions, including Kanto, the Orange Islands, and Johto, and then enter the Pokemon League competitions there. Along the way, they run into many confrontations with Jessie, James, and Meowth, a trio of Pokemon thieves who are apart of an evil organization called "Team Rocket". But everytime Team Rocket try to do their evil deeds, they fail thanks to Ash and his Pokemon.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>absurdist humour</name>
<description>Surreal humour, also known as absurdist humour, is a form of humour predicated on deliberate violations of causal reasoning, producing events and behaviours that are obviously illogical. Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, non-sequiturs, irrational or absurd situations, and expressions of nonsense.
The humour arises from a subversion of audience`s expectations, so that amusement is founded on unpredictability, separate from a logical analysis of the situation. Its appeal stems from the fact that the situation described is exceedingly ridiculous or unlikely.
On an analytical level, all jokes contain a certain amount of incongruity, but while regular jokes carry an incongruity that the audience accepts as compatible with expectations, absurd jokes are characterized by a disproportionate amount of it, with the punch line delivering a situation incompatible with the world as we know it and failing to resolve the matter in the audience`s eyes.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>adventure</name>
<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<description>In our terms, a proxy battle is a battle where humans use creatures/robots to do the fighting for them, either by commanding those creatures/robots or by simply evolving them/changing them into battle mode. Often the training aspect is also involved, or in some cases the proxies are nothing more than holographic representatives of some other variation of competition (like for example a card game). While many popular shounen anime fit under this category, it`s not limited to shounen anime.</description>

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

<name>merchandising show</name>
<description>The bane of the parent`s wallet; this show usually has only a single reason for existence: to advertise the toy line it is based upon to the intended target audience. The variety of toys can range from accessories for girls and boys, to cards and figures or models. Most often the ability of the toys will be exaggerated or invokes magic to work in the anime. The toys`s names will also be continuously repeated in the anime, often accompanied by flashy effects and loud shouting. Combined with an intricate story that typically involves an adventure or a tournament of sorts, it makes for an effective commercial.</description>

<description>In a series based around an endless series of one-on-one fights, defeating a Worthy Opponent or The Rival will sometimes convert them to the hero`s side, if not always to his cause. 
Furthermore, no matter how many people the Worthy Opponent has killed, how much grief he has caused, even if he slaughtered helpless children or the hero`s own family, as soon as he shows a bit of remorse or goes out of his way to help the hero even once, he will be welcomed into the hero`s circle of True Companions with open arms.

<description>The most common example is that of a voice, either that of one of the characters or entirely unrelated, that appears at the beginning of an episode to offer a summary or introduction, and at the end of an episode for closure or for a preview to hint upon what to expect next.
Another use of narration comes in the form of a dominant voice belonging to one of the protagonists, intended only for the viewer and revealing the intimate thoughts to whom it belongs. This type of narration occurs frequently throughout the duration of the episode or movie.</description>

No matter what the genre may be or what the storyline consists of, this series just keeps on going... and on... and on.
The obvious downside to this is the lack of story-related focus, usually some vague goal is simply never reached. This lack of conclusion can tend to annoy, making the whole series pretty much pointless.

<description>An episodic anime consists of many successive short arcs that are generally 1-2 episodes in length, with strong plot continuity within each arc but generally little continuity from one arc to the next. For long shows (well upwards of 50 episodes), the episode count constraint is less tight; for example, a show with close to 250 episodes would also be considered episodic if it consisted of a majority of arcs of up to 3 or maybe 4 episodes and possibly also very few slightly longer arcs.</description>

<description>Bulbasaur is known as the Seed Pokemon. Bulbasaur looks like small, rounder turquoise dicynodon, a mammal-like reptile from the Permian Period. Bulbasaur`s most distinctive feature is the green bulb planted on its back. The plant sprouts and grows with the Pokemon. The bulb synthesizes solar rays. It can later use the energy stored for recovering itself (Synthesis) or release it in the form of a Solarbeam. Because of this Bulbasaur is usually seen napping in bright sunlight. The bulb constantly takes in nourishment from the sun, allowing both the Bulbasaur and the bulb to grow over time. It also allows them to go days without eating by using the nutrients stored in the bulb.</description>

<description>Ivysaur is known as the Seed Pokémon. While almost the same as Bulbasaur the bulb on its back has grown. Having grown much larger, the bulb forces their legs to become stronger and thicker to accommodate the weight, and makes it harder for them to stand on their hind legs. Both the Ivysaur and the bulb grow stronger and larger from sunlight. When the bulb is ready to bloom, they will spend more time lying in sunlight, and the bulb will give off a sweet scent.</description>

<description>Venusaur known as the Seed Pokémon, is the final stage in Bulbasaur evolution. The seed finally bloomed into a huge flower, vaguely resembling a Rafflesia. The flower constantly draws in sunlight for nutrition, characterized by vivid colors and a soothing aroma, and power, which is much more substantial in the summer. They are always on the move to absorb more sunlight, though they usually remain quiet and still while absorbing it. After it rains, the aroma is much stronger, which attracts other Pokémon. Female Venusaur have a seed coming out of the flower, possibly representing a pregnancy. Being the final form of Grass starter, Venusaur can learn Hyper Beam, Giga Impact and Frenzy Plant.</description>

<description>Charmander known as the Lizard Pokémon, is a fire type Pokémon. The Name comes from "Charcoal" (a material used to Create Fire) and "Salamander". They are selectable as one of three "Starter Pokémon" at the beginning of the games of the main series of Pokémon RPGs that are set primarily in the Kanto region (Pokémon Red and Blue for Game Boy, as well as their remakes Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen for Game Boy Advance). Charmander are not acquirable anywhere else in the main series aside from Pokémon Yellow. Charmander is a Fire Dinosaur-Lizard Type Pokémon. It`s name is from the words char meaning to cook and mander meaning a salamander which is a lizard-like amphibian. The end of a Charmander`s tail is alight with a flame, and the flame`s status reflects both the physical health and the emotions of the individual. If the flame were to ever go out, the Charmander would die.</description>

<description>Charizard is a dual-type Fire/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Charmeleon starting at level 36. It is the final form of Charmander. It can Mega Evolve into two forms: Mega Charizard X using Charizardite X and Mega Charizard Y using Charizardite Y. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Charizard is the game mascot of Pokémon Red and FireRed Versions.
Charizard is a draconic, bipedal Pokémon. It is primarily orange with a cream underside from the chest to the tip of its tail. It has a long neck, small blue eyes, slightly raised nostrils, and two horn-like structures protruding from the back of its rectangular head. There are two fangs visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is closed. Two large wings with blue-green undersides sprout from its back, and a horn-like appendage juts out from the third joint of each wing. A single wing-finger is visible through the center of each wing membrane. Charizard`s arms are short and skinny compared to its robust belly, and each limb has three white claws. It has stocky legs with cream-colored soles on each of its plantigrade feet. The tip of its long, tapering tail burns with a sizable flame.
Charizard has two Mega Forms. Both feature a shorter snout, white, vertical slit pupils, and a bright underside reaching the lower jaw.
As Mega Charizard X, its body and legs are more physically fit, though its arms remain thin. Its skin turns black with a sky-blue underside and soles. Two spikes with blue tips curve upward from the front and back of each shoulder, while the tips of its horns sharpen, turn blue, and curve slightly upward. Its brow and claws are larger, and its eyes are now red. It has two small, fin-like spikes under each horn and two more down its lower neck. The finger disappears from the wing membrane, and the lower edges are divided into large, rounded points. The third joint of each wing-arm is adorned with a claw-like spike. Mega Charizard X breathes blue flames out the sides of its mouth, and the flame on its tail now burns blue. It is said that its new power turns it black and creates more intense flames.
As Mega Charizard Y, it becomes sleeker in appearance but retains its normal coloration. It has three pointed horns on the back of its head, the middle of which is longer. Its snout has larger fangs and a ridge on the nose. Its neck is shorter, but its torso is thinner and longer. It features longer digitigrade feet. Its hands are less developed, with extremely shortened fingers that are no longer separated from each other. Small wings develop on its wrists, while the ones on its back become larger, lose the wing finger passing through their membrane and end up with ragged edges. The back of its tail has a large spike at the base and three smaller ones near the tip, which now burns with a longer flame. Mega Charizard Y is said to have incredible flying prowess that is greater than a jet fighter.
As Gigantamax Charizard, it becomes larger and physically fit. The lower part of its body glows white with several yellow diamonds located on the lower belly. There are also diamond-shaped spots located on the front legs. The claws located on its hand and feet become longer and sharp. The feet become longer and digitigrade, retaining small glowing soles under the forefeet. The wings are transformed into literal flame wings extending to the shoulder blade and two flames located on the horns. The colossal, flamed wings were created from the energy of Gigantamaxing. The sclera of the eyes becomes yellow. The glow of a flame can be seen in the mouth, and the teeth grow, with the lower front teeth and three teeth in the middle now protruding when the mouth is closed. The flame on the tail extends out and has three red clouds surrounding it. The flames within Gigantamax Charizard burns hotter than 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit. When it roars, the temperature can climb to even higher lengths. The wings are capable of being hotter than magma which Charizard uses to burn its opponents.
Charizard flies in search of powerful opponents to battle, and its fire will burn hotter as it gains experience. Its fiery breath is capable of melting boulders, massive glaciers, and has been known to accidentally cause forest fires. In the past, Blast Burn was its signature move. Charizard typically inhabit mountains and valleys, such as the Charicific Valley in Johto. The anime has shown that only a weak Charizard would show off its power. It also showed that Charizard can swim underwater, with Pokémon Origins further showing that the flame on the tip of the tail can still keep burning underwater. The wings of Charizard can carry to an altitude of 4,600 feet.
Charizard is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Wildfire.</description>

Squirtle are not acquirable anywhere else in the main series aside from Pokémon Yellow. The name "Squirtle" is a portmanteau of the words "squirt" and "turtle". When feeling threatened, Squirtle withdraw their limbs into their shells and spray water from their mouth with great force, either to attack their opponent or merely to intimidate it.</description>

In the main Pokémon game series, a Wartortle is only acquired when a Squirtle grows past experience level 16 and is evolved into a Wartortle. Wartortle are more aggressive than Squirtle, and their shells often feature scratches obtained in battles with other Pokémon. Their ability to swim is greatly aided by their long ears and long, fluffy tail for balance. Their tails are long enough that when a Wartortle withdraws into its shell, part of the tail still sticks out. They can apparently live for thousands of years.</description>

In the main Pokémon game series, a Blastoise is only acquired when a Wartortle grows past experience level 36 and evolves into a Blastoise. As a Blastoise, two sections of the hefty shell open up to reveal cannon-like spouts on the Pokémon`s back that can fire pressurized water at a target with enough force that even concrete walls and thick steel can be punctured. The spouts are also very accurate, since a Blastoise can strike distant tin cans with the water from its spouts!</description>

<description>Caterpie known as the Worm Pokémon, are larval Pokémon found in the wild early in the Kanto and Johto regions. In main series Pokémon games set in these regions, Caterpie are among the earliest and easiest Pokémon species caught by players, as they are very weak. They can be evolved into their cocoon-like Metapod form and eventually into the butterfly-like Butterfree form. Caterpie in the wild employ biological adaptations to survive, much like real caterpillars, in that their green bodies are useful for camouflage in foliage, their eyes are patterned to scare away predators, their suction-cup feet allow them to climb any surface, and the osmeterium on their heads can project a horrid stench to repel predators. It bears a resemblance to the spicebush swallowtail caterpillar.
In the anime, Caterpie as the first Pokémon Ash ever caught in his trainer career, and it eventually evolved into a Butterfree and was later traded for a Raticate on the S.S. Saint Anne but is traded back later in the episode. Ash releases it later so it could mate with a pink Butterfree.</description>

<description>Butterfree is a dual-type Bug/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Metapod starting at level 10. It is the final form of Caterpie. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Butterfree resembles a vaguely anthropomorphic butterfly with a purple body. Unlike true insects, it only has two body segments and four light blue legs. The upper pair of legs resembles small, three-fingered hands, while the lower pair resembles long, digit-less feet. Butterfree has two black antennae, a light blue snout with two fangs underneath, and large, red compound eyes. Its two pairs of wings are white with black venation. Two oval scales on a female Butterfree`s lower wings are black, but they are white on a male.
As Gigantamax Butterfree, its size increases to gigantic length with altered look. The wings and its pattern changes to light and dark green color with white. The antennae change to bright green and extends to the point where the tip bends, and three red clouds surround it. The eyes changes to bright glowing red. A fur-like circle is attached to both the wings and back of Butterfree. Several green scales can be seen floating around Butterfree, which are its most effective weapons, capable of releasing paralysis, poisoning, or sleep. The massive wings are powerful enough to lift a 10-ton truck through a simple flap. The wind it generates can scatter poisonous scales throughout the area, making it dangerous to be near it.
Butterfree`s wings are covered with poisonous powders that fall off continuously as it flies. It will defend Caterpie from bird Pokémon using this powder. This powder also repels water, enabling it to gather honey even in the rain. Butterfree will roam up to six miles (ten kilometers) from its nest in search of honey, which it carries with the hairs of its legs. Sometimes it has territorial disputes with Cutiefly over fields of flowers. It also consumes sap from trees pierced by Heracross, as seen in the anime. Butterfree is found in temperate forests and jungles, but it has also been observed flying near the ocean as part of its migratory breeding pattern.
Gigantamax Butterfree is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Befuddle.</description>

Commonly spotted in the forests and grasslands, eating leaves, Weedle are well protected from predators by sharp two-inch barbs on their heads which secrete a strong poison, and another stinger is on each Weedle`s rear. Sniffing with its big red proboscis, a Weedle uses its extremely acute sense of smell to find the types of leaves it eats.</description>

Within the shell, a Kakuna busily prepares itself for evolution into its adult form, and the amount of energy released by this process makes the shell quite hot to the touch. In the wild, Kakuna are often found near or on trees, and because their range of motion is extremely limited, they may be mistaken for dead. Carelessly approaching a Kakuna in this state would be extremely unwise because it can still extend the barb of its poisonous stinger to protect itself from threats.</description>

Beedrill are extremely territorial, and will be set off by anything that approaches a Beedrill nest. When angered, Beedrill attack in a furious swarm, and the sharp ends of their stingers and the poison stored in their abdomens will definitely be put to use.</description>

<description>Pidgey, known as the Tiny Bird Pokémon, is a bird-like Pokémon, whose original name in the English beta version of Pokémon Red and Blue was "Pidge". Pidgey was first introduced in the United States in Red and Blue. They are one of the first wild Pokémon that players encounter in those games. Pidgey does not like to fight, and will use its wings to stir up clouds of sand in an attempt to distract its would-be opponent and escape. Pidgey also uses this technique to bring its preferred prey of small insects into the open. Pidgey seems to possess magnetoception, as it is capable of returning to its nest from any location without fail.
Pidgey also appeared in the first television episode, Pokémon, I Choose You!, when the main character, Ash Ketchum, attempts to catch one. He fails when it uses its Gust attack to blow him away and escapes. Afterwards, it uses its Sand Attack to blind Ash, allowing it to get away.</description>

<description>Pidgeotto, known as the Bird Pokémon, is a bird-like Pokémon, is a larger and stronger form that Pidgey takes when it gains enough experience. In the main Pokémon game series, a Pidgeotto is only acquired when a Pidgey grows past experience level 18 and evolves into a Pidgeotto. A Pidgeotto is extremely territorial, generally claiming a large area with its nest built in the center. Full of vitality, it constantly patrols its territory, mercilessly attacking intruders. They fly about in circular patterns while hunting, and can spot the movements of their prey on the ground no matter how high they fly. The Pidgeotto attacks with its wickedly sharp talons and carries its prey, including Exeggcute and Magikarp, back to its nest from as far as 60 miles away - or more.
Pidgeotto was the second Pokémon Ash caught in the beginning of his career, eventually evolving into Pidgeot.</description>

<description>Pidgeot, known as the Bird Pokémon, is a bird-like Pokémon, whose original name in the English beta version of Pokémon Red and Blue was "Pidgeott", is the fully grown and developed form of the Pidgey species evolution line. In the main Pokémon game series, a Pidgeot is only acquired when a Pidgeotto grows past experience level 36 and is evolved into a Pidgeot. Pidgeot are large, powerful birds admired for their glossy plumage and their battling ability. With their powerful chest muscles at work, Pidgeot can flap their wings fast enough to whip up gusts of winds to rival tornadoes. Pidgeot are very aerodynamic, capable of soaring to an altitude of 3300 feet and reaching speeds of up to Mach 2. Like Pidgeotto, Pidgeot feed on Magikarp by swooping from the sky and snatching them out of the water with their talons. Pidgeot appear very similar to Pidgeotto, so much so that one has been easily mistaken for the other, even by official sources.
In the Pokémon anime, Ash`s Pidgeotto evolves into a Pidgeot near the end of the Kanto saga, and remained in Pallet Town to watch over a flock of Pidgey and Pidgeotto while Ash went off to the Orange Islands.</description>

Rattata are among the earliest Pokémon that can be caught by players, so much so that it is said that the presence of one Rattata indicates the presence of more than forty Rattata in the area. They make their nests almost anywhere and as extreme omnivores eat anything they can scavenge. A Rattata`s fangs grow continuously throughout its lifespan, so it whittles them down to a comfortable size by gnawing on hard objects.</description>

Its webbed feet allow it to swim as it hunts prey, and its fangs are tough enough to topple concrete buildings.</description>

<description>Spearow is a small, bird Pokémon with short wings and a small, stubby beak. It is noted for being frail, but it makes up for that with its "Mirror Move" ability. It eats insects in grassy areas by flushing them out with its wings, and plucking at them with its beak. Its wings aren`t good for long distance travel or high flying, but it is able to fly at high speeds by flapping its wings very rapidly. It is very territorial, constantly buzzing about and calling with a loud cry that can be heard from half a mile away. It serves to scare away predators and keep in touch with other Spearow, which usually is used to alert them of danger. The golden spearow has golden wings and a golden beak, it also has a lighter color of brown feathers.</description>

It has a large wingspan; elongated neck; and thin, long beak; all characteristics being a radical departure from its short-winged, stubby-beaked pre-evolved form Spearow. Fearow uses its great wings to catch air currents and effortlessly glide over large distances for as long as a day without having to land or rest. It flies high into the sky, and swoops down at its prey. By using a combination of its neck and beak, it has a large reach, allowing it to pluck bugs from the ground or easily pluck prey from soil or water as it swoops down. If it senses danger, it avoids it if possible.</description>

The name Ekans is the word snake backwards. Ekans` Japanese name, Arbo, is a reversal by morae of the word boa. Ekans` name in the English beta version was also Arbo.
In the anime, the most notable Ekans was owned by Jessie, who had received it before episode 2 for her birthday. It later evolved into an Arbok and was released.
Ekans evolves into Arbok at level 22.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Pikachu is an Electric-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Pichu when leveled up with high friendship and evolves into Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone. However, the starter Pikachu in Pokémon Yellow will refuse to evolve into Raichu unless it is traded and evolved on another save file.
In Alola, Pikachu will evolve into Alolan Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone.
It also has a Gigantamax form.
Pikachu is popularly known as the mascot of the Pokémon franchise and a major representative of Nintendo`s collective mascots.
It is also the game mascot and starter Pokémon of Pokémon Yellow and Pokémon: Let`s Go, Pikachu!. It has made numerous appearances on the boxes of spin-off titles.
Pikachu is also the starter Pokémon in Pokémon Rumble Blast and Pokémon Rumble World.
Pikachu is a short, chubby rodent Pokémon. It is covered in yellow fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back. It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch for electricity storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is a patch of brown fur. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs.
The anime has shown that wild Pikachu live in groups in forested areas. Pikachu communicate amongst themselves using squeaks and tail-shaking as friendly gestures. In the anime, Alolan Pikachu are known to greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Electricity can be used to receive and send messages with each other, as well as other Electric Pokémon species. It raises its tail to check its surroundings and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups grow, they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. Pikachu forages for Berries, which it roasts with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that Pikachu inhabits a location is patches of burnt grass. It has been observed eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment.
Pikachu charges itself while sleeping overnight, though stress and a lack of sleep can affect this. It is able to release electric discharges of varying intensity. Pikachu has been known to build up energy in its glands, which it will need to discharge to avoid complications. It is also able to release energy through its tail, which acts as a grounding rod, as well as recharging fellow Pikachu with electric shocks. Pikachu can also electrify itself to use its signature move Volt Tackle.
Pikachu has three alternate forms: one, the Cosplay Pikachu appeared exclusively in Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. It is always female, has a black heart-shaped spot at the end of its tail, and can be dressed in any of five outfits corresponding to the five Contest conditions. The second form is Pikachu in a cap, which debuted as an event-exclusive Pokémon in Generation VII. It is always male and has seven variants, each wearing one of Ash`s hats from the anime. In addition to these two forms, many other Pikachu variants have appeared in various media. The last, Partner Pikachu is the Pokémon the player starts with in Pokémon: Let`s Go, Pikachu!. This Pikachu can be either gender, has higher base stats, and has access to moves that normal Pikachu do not.
As Gigantamax Pikachu, it becomes larger and chubbier. Its tail becomes longer and stores all of the electricity it generates, causing it to glow a bright yellow and enabling it to become as powerful as a lightning strike. Its power is equal to that a power plant; however, it is difficult to use it in peoples` homes since Pikachu can only remain in its Gigantamax form for a short time.
Pikachu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Catastropika, while Pikachu in a cap has its own exclusive Z-Move, 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt. Partner Pikachu is the only Pokémon capable of using Zippy Zap, Floaty Fall, Splishy Splash, and the Partner Power, Pika Papow. Pikachu is the only Pokémon capable of using the Light Ball item. Gigantamax Pikachu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Volt Crash.</description>

<description>Raichu is a taller, potbellied form that Pikachu takes when he is given a thunder stone, causing its tail to grow long and black with a lightning bolt on the end and fur to turn orange. It also has a white underbelly, brown stripes on its back, and yellow cheeks, in contrast to Pikachu`s red cheeks and Pichu`s pink cheeks. In the main Pokemon game series, a Raichu is only acquired when an item called a Thunderstone is applied to a Pikachu so that it evolves into a Raichu. Raichu can only learn moves in the Pikachu stage, so the only way to make Raichu learn more moves is by using a TM. Raichu can generate 10,000 or even 100,000 volts of electricity, enough to knock out Pokemon several times its size, such as a Dragonite, as stated in the anime. Raichu`s name is a portmanteau of the kanji 雷 rai, meaning thunder, or lightning bolt, and chuu, which is the Japanese onomatopoeia for a mouse`s squeak.</description>

<description>Sandshrew are a species of brick-skinned mouse-like Pokémon found in several regions throughout the Pokémon world. Despite its name, Sandshrew`s appearance borrows more from the armadillo or the pangolin than from the shrew; its primary means of defense when threatened is to instantly curl up its body into a ball, leaving only its tough skin exposed. When it is rolled up like this, Sandshrew has the potential to withstand many attacks, as well as being dropped from a great height (also similar to hedgehogs). Sandshrew`s natural environment is deep underground in arid, sandy locations with very little moisture, such as a desert. It chooses this habitat to keep its hide as dry and tough as possible, while the sand also provides it with good camouflage.
In keeping with its physical characteristics, Sandshrew has high Defense in the video games, but low Speed. From Ruby and Sapphire onwards, it has the ability Sand Veil, which increases its evasion during a sandstorm. Sandshrew also appears in the spin-off game Pokémon Snap.
A Sandshrew owned by A.J. is featured in the eighth anime episode, "The Path to the Pokémon League." It had many notable traits, such as the ability to withstand water and its knowledge of Fissure, which it used to dispatch Team Rocket.</description>

<description>Sandslash are a larger and stronger form that Sandshrew take when they gain enough experience to reach level 22. Generally they are a moderately large, bipedal hedgehog or pangolin-like creature with hard yellow skin, lengthy claws, and a back loaded with an assemblage of large brown spikes. These spikes are hardened sections of Sandslash`s hide that grow to form a natural self-defense when Sandslash curls into a ball. Each spike remains on Sandslash for one year, after which it falls off and a new spike grows in its place. Sandslash can be found in desert areas, particularly close to dry forests. Sandslash`s spikes serve a number of purposes to help cope with its environment, such as providing shade to protect it from the sun and heatstroke or using them offensively to harm both predators and prey. It uses its claws to climb trees, cut up food and dig, the latter being an activity that can cause them to break if done too quickly. It cannot run very quickly, but it is very quick with its claws.</description>

Its horn is hard enough to pierce a diamond and contains secreted venom, making it a powerful stabbing tool upon prey and Pokémon battle opponents. Nidoking have immense upper-body strength, being able to snap a telephone pole like it were a twig. It uses its tail to smash down its target, then constrict it to break its bones. Its thick tail packs enormously destructive power capable of toppling a metal transmission tower.
As several Pokémon seem to have been designed to resemble other aspects of Japanese pop culture and mythology, it is interesting to note that Nidoking bears a resemblance to Baragon, a monster that has appeared in the Godzilla movie series.
In the main Pokémon game series, a Nidoking can only be acquired when a Moon Stone item is applied to a Nidorino so that the creature is evolved into a Nidoking. They are the masculine equivalent to Nidoqueen. Also, they are more primal, fighting other Nidoking for such matters as territory or food. (Or a Nidoqueen, in mating season.)</description>

<description>Clefairy are small, bipedal Pokémon. Popular as pets for their adorable features, Clefairy have short, pink fur, with a large brown patch on each of their two pointed ears. Between these ears is a large swirl of pink fur. They have two small eyes, no nose, and a small mouth with one tiny, protruding fang. They also have a patch of darker pink fur under each eye, which seems to resemble blushing cheeks.
Clefairy can be seen playing in groups, on the night of a full moon, retreating to their group slumber when dawn arrives. These Pokémon are noted to be able to store moonlight in the wings on their backs, giving them the power to float in mid-air. There have been sightings of Clefairy, with their evolutionary forms Cleffa and Clefable, using spaceships, and the Moon Stones used to evolve Clefairy are also rumored to come from extraplanetary locations. Clefairy seem to be based on fairies, as they are magical, winged creatures, lending credit to their name. Also, their game call seems to make a sound similar to their Japanese name.
Clefairy`s biology is somewhat unclear. While they cannot truly fly with their wings, they do travel in a bouncy skipping walk, as if walking on the surface of the moon. When they wave their finger, it stimulates the blood and triggers their brain to perform random attacks from any other Pokèmon, which is the basis of their signature Metronome attack.</description>

<description>Clefable is similar to Clefairy in appearance. It is larger than its pre-evolved form, with prominent ears and a pair of jagged wings on its back. Clefable inhabit remote mountainous areas and generally any environment that has sufficiently little ambient noise. Clefable`s hearing is extremely sensitive - it is said that it can discern the sound of a pin falling 1,100 yards (1,000 m) away, so it is averse to living in areas with sound pollution (compare with Whismur).
Clefable are also extremely timid, and rarely seen in the wild. They avoid all contact with outsiders. Even sensing the presence of others in the area (which is fairly easy thanks to their prodigious hearing) will cause it to run and hide immediately. They will, however, come into the open on quiet, moonlit nights to take a stroll on a lake.
Clefable`s wings are probably not fit for real flight, but they allow it to move in a skipping, bouncy manner as if it were walking on the moon`s surface. They can even walk across the water`s surface this way, so when it takes the aforementioned stroll on the lake, it literally takes a stroll on the lake. Clefable`s wings, its hovering walk, its timidity and elusiveness have led them to be categorized as a type of fairy in the Pokemon world.</description>

<description>Vulpix is a fox-like creature with six curled tails, based on the Japanese fox spirit kitsune. Most commonly female, Vulpix are especially known for being beautiful. As Vulpix undergo Pokemon evolution, their red fur turns pale yellow and they grow three extra tails. Vulpix usually have a friendly, if not spoiled, temperament. Because of the flame in their bodies, when the temperature outside increases, they let flames out of their mouths to prevent their body temperature from getting too hot. In the wild, Vulpix will feign injury to escape from more powerful predators.
During the first season of the Pokemon anime, Vulpix appears often as one of Brock`s Pokemon. It was given to him by a girl named Susie who felt she could not take care of it well. Brock, who felt he was only "babysitting", gives it back to Susie in the season four episode called "Beauty and the Breeder".
Its Japanese name, Rokon is a portmanteau of six (六, roku) and kon (from kon kon, an onomatopoeic word describing the bark of a fox), or an alternate reading of the Japanese word for kitsune (狐, kitsune), meaning fox - in this case, the reading is ko (こ). Its English name may have been derived from the scientific name for a group of foxes, Vulpes.</description>

Ninetales is highly intelligent and able to understand human speech, but also vengeful; Ninetales have been recorded as putting a 1,000 year curse on anyone who grabs one of their tails, which is a focus of the plot in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team. They, along with Vulpix, have keen senses of smell, hearing, and sight. It can only be obtained by using a Fire Stone on a Vulpix. Its Japanese name Kyuukon comes from a combination of the Japanese number 9, kyu, and the sound of a barking fox.
In the anime, Ash and the gang find an abandoned mansion and Brock is deceived by a Ninetales, whose master strongly resembles Brock.
Since it has nine tails, the Pokemon`s name is very commonly misspelled as "Ninetails." Even the Game Boy Color port of the Pokemon Trading Card game uses this misspelling.</description>

<description>Jigglypuff, known as the "Balloon" species of Pokémon, are characterized by putting their enemies to sleep by singing a lullaby. Before beginning to sing, they mesmerize the opponent with their soft, glowing eyes, and if they inflate themselves, they can sing for longer periods of time. They can easily adjust the wavelength of their voices to that of the brain waves of a sleeping being, allowing for their pleasing melody to put its audience to sleep. They sing without pausing to take a breath, so if the opponent is resistant to sleeping, they potentially run out of air.
In the Pokémon anime series, Jigglypuff is a recurring character who aspires to be a great singer after the inspiration of Ash Ketchum and company. Unfortunately for it, every potential audience falls asleep before the song finishes. Jigglypuff does not usually choose an appropriate time to sing and has been a hazard many times, causing Ash Ketchum and his companions to often find themselves running away from Jigglypuff. It keeps with it a black marker, its "microphone," and uses it to scribble on anyone who falls asleep while it`s performing.
Its desire to have someone listen to the entire song was finally satisfied when it encountered a Whismur, who was able to stay awake due to its Soundproof ability.
Also, Jigglypuff`s Japanese name, Purin, translates into "pudding".</description>

<description>Wigglytuff is a relatively large pink balloon-like Pokemon with a white underbelly, large blue baby-like eyes, a pair of large rabbit ears, and a twisty tuft of pink hair on its forehead. It evolves from Jigglypuff through a Moon Stone. In fact, it`s remarkably similar to its pre-evolved form, Jigglypuff, except the ears have grown larger and it now maintains an "oval" shape. Wigglytuff`s eyes are always covered by a thin layer of tears, so that if any dust gets into Wigglytuff`s eyes, it is quickly cried away. In the games, Wigglytuff`s fur is described to be "sublime", so much so that if two of them come into close contact with each other, they are difficult to separate. In the television series, Wigglytuff is generally accepted as the most powerful Pokemon.</description>

<description>Golbat are a larger, stronger, and more developed form that Zubat take on when they gain enough experience. In the main Pokemon game series, a Golbat is acquired when a Zubat grows past experience level 22 and is evolved into a Golbat. Golbat are found in some cave areas.
Golbat is a fierce, nocturnal Pokémon, residing in the darkness of caves, and is most active in the pitch black of night, especially if the moon is in its new phase. It is widely known and despised for its feeding behavior: Sucking fresh blood from living things in large quantities. Once it has found a living target, it attacks in a stealthy manner, often striking without warning from behind, to harshly bite down on its prey with its four sharp fangs strong enough to puncture the hide of any animal-like Pokemon, however strong the hide might be. It then proceeds to drink ten ounces of blood instantly. Golbat enjoys blood so much that it does not want to stop, even though a lot of blood will weigh it down enough so that, if it is able to even fly afterwards, it flies clumsily.
Surprisingly, after each attack and feeding sequence, Golbat`s own blood type changes into that of its victim. Once it strikes, it will not stop draining energy from the victim even if it gets too heavy to fly. Like Zubat, the female`s fangs are smaller than the male`s.</description>

<description>Oddish are a weed-like Pokémon found in all regions throughout the Pokémon world. (with the exception of Pokémon Blue and Pokémon Leaf Green) Oddish looks like a small animated onion/turnip plant with a rounded body. Its body is blue or purple with two small feet and red eyes. On top of its head grows a large clump of 5 long green blades of grass. Its name likely came from the words "odd" and "radish".
Oddish is a nocturnal Pokémon, using moonlight rather than the sun`s rays for photosynthesis. During the day, Oddish avoids the sun`s heat and brightness by burying itself into the earth, leaving only the leaves on top of its head visible above ground. In this way it disguises itself as a plant, misdirecting its carnivorous diurnal predators.
While buried, Oddish nourishes itself by absorbing nutrients from the soil using its feet, which are said to temporarily change into a root-like structure for this purpose.
Oddish has been known to use its leaves as hands, such as one who used this to climb a rope net and tried to fly like a Hoppip.
If anyone pulls at Oddish`s leaves and tries to uproot it while it is buried underground, Oddish will react by shrieking in a cute, high-pitched voice. This mirrors the behavior of the legendary mandrake in a similar situation, although it seems that Oddish`s squeaks do not have the same dire consequences as a mandrake`s.</description>

<description>Gloom is a flower-like Pokémon that is a larger and stronger evolution of Oddish. Gloom are obtained when an Oddish gains enough experience to grow up to level 21. Gloom can also be found in most grassy areas of most regions.
The fluid that oozes from its mouth is a sweet nectar that is used to attract prey. Once the prey is attracted, the nectar will cling to the prey, trapping it. The nectar mostly attracts prey that lack a sense of smell, as the nectar smells horrible.
As well as its nectar, the pistil of Gloom`s flower smells incredibly foul; it can be smelled from over a mile away. It has been found that approximately 1 in 1,000 people enjoy the scent that Gloom emits. Those that don`t enjoy the smell have been known to faint upon smelling it. When Gloom is faced with danger, the stench worsens. If it is feeling calm or secure, it does not release the horrible aroma. Oddly enough, people have been known to sniff Gloom, just to get a reaction. This is similar to real world drug addiction.
It is said to widely shower its attacks; with moves such as Stun Spore, Poison Powder, and Sleep Powder, it has the ability to cause status problems on its foes. It is also notable that Gloom has two evolved forms (from the second generation onwards), Vileplume and Bellossom. Unlike other Pokémon that evolve via level, Gloom will not evolve until it is exposed to an evolution stone; a Leaf Stone will make a Vileplume, while a Sun Stone produces a Bellossom.</description>

<description>Vileplume is a huge flower-like Pokémon that is a larger and stronger evolution of Gloom. Vileplumes can be obtained by using a Leaf Stone with a Gloom.
Vileplume is known for its extremely offensive stench that comes from its large red flower. Vileplume uses this stench in battle, catching its foes off guard when they start to back away from the horrible smell. However, Vileplume`s flower can actually be a hindrance in battle due to it being very heavy and bulky. Due to of its weight, Vileplume walks very slowly, and it often must use its hands to help support the flower. Vileplume can be found in forests and they like to stay low to the ground. When they sleep, their huge petals droop over their head and they blend in more with the plants around them. They also release toxic, dense pollen into the air in this position so animals don`t go near them. At night, they sometimes gather together to perform odd rituals - during this time they release toxic pollen to deter intruders. The white markings on this flower are larger in the female than in the male. Paul uses Vileplume to battle Tyrogue, but his Vileplume is useless for Fighting-type Pokemon.</description>

<description>Paras is a basic parasite-like Pokémon that has two mushrooms on its back. Paras can be found in some caves and the Safari Zone in Kanto and in Ilex Forest and the Bug Catching Contest in Johto.
Paras is born with tiny spores covering their body, which grow as the Pokémon feeds, called tochukaso mushrooms. It is noted in that the relationship between the host and the mushrooms is a symbiotic relationship: the mushrooms will sap energy from the host, causing the Paras to continuously burrow underground in forest areas to gnaw on tree roots, since the tochukaso draws most of the energy from the roots. In return, the mushrooms defend the host by spraying toxic spores at enemies. The mushrooms themselves have strong healing properties, and are valued for their life extending properties.</description>

Venonat, though it is based on a bug, is covered in thin, stiff fur, which is said to be used for protection. It has two concentrated clusters of microscopic, red eyes. They can be used to shoot powerful beams, and also function as radar, which enables Venonat to be active at night and to easily capture its preferred prey of small, nocturnal insects. Venonat prefers the dark, inhabiting the hollows of trees and other shadowed areas, yet is attracted to bright lights.</description>

Its wings are covered in extremely toxic, dust-like scales. These scales are color-coded to indicate the effect they will have upon coming into contact with a living creature, darker colours meaning poison, and lighter colours meaning paralysis. Venomoth is similar to Butterfree in that they both flap their wings to release toxic powders. However, Venomoth seems to be the more dangerous of the two, as it is described as scattering its toxins with every flap of its wings. Much like Venonat, Venomoth is nocturnal and feeds upon small insects.</description>

<description>Meowth is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves into Persian starting at level 28. It also has a Gigantamax form.
In Alola, Meowth has a Dark-type regional form. It normally evolves into Alolan Persian when leveled up with high friendship. However, in Pokémon: Let`s Go, Pikachu! and Let`s Go, Eevee!, it instead evolves into Alolan Persian starting at level 28.
In Galar, Meowth has a Steel-type regional form. It evolves into Perrserker starting at level 28.
Meowth is a small, feline Pokémon with cream-colored fur that turns brown at the tips of its hind paws and tail. Its ovoid head features four prominent whiskers, wide eyes with slit pupils, two pointed teeth in the upper jaw, and a gold koban coin embedded in its forehead. Its ears are black with brown interiors and are flanked with an additional pair of long whiskers. Meowth is a quadruped with the ability to walk on its hind legs; while the games always depict Meowth on two legs, the anime states that Meowth normally walks on all fours. It can freely manipulate its claws, retracting them when it wants to move silently. The tip of its tail curls tightly.
Meowth is attracted to round and shiny objects and has the unique ability to produce coins using Pay Day. Being nocturnal, it is known to wander about city streets at night and pick up anything that sparkles, including loose change. Upon finding a sparkling object, its eyes will glitter and the coin on its forehead will shine brightly. It shares this intrigue with Murkrow, with whom it often fights with for objects and prey. Meowth is a playful but fickle Pokémon with the capacity for human-like intelligence. At least one member of the species teaching itself how to speak. Meowth tends to live in urban areas.
Meowth was introduced to Alola as a gift to royalty. The luxurious royal lifestyle soon led to Meowth diverging from its origins and becoming the selfish, prideful, and cunning Alolan Meowth. Alolan Meowth will turn hysterical if its coin or pride are besmirched. When the monarchy fell, the rare Alolan Meowth went feral and eventually grew as common in Alola as anywhere else. Alolan Meowth`s fur is a light blue-gray color. Instead of brown markings, the tip of its tail, whiskers, digits, and the insides of its ears a whitish-gray. Alolan Meowth`s whiskers have a slight curve compared to regular Meowth`s straighter whiskers, and it has silvery eyes.
Galarian Meowth has a shaggy, greyish-brown coat resembling a beard, as well as yellow eyes and a toothy grin. Its coin is now black and extremely hard, with the hardest coins being especially valued. Galarian Meowth`s body has partially turned to iron as a result of many years of living with a race of savage seafarers.
As Gigantamax Meowth, it has become larger and longer in size. The body extends from lower half to the shoulder, while the gold coin gains a symbol. Meowth`s eyes change to a glowing gold color. The tail grows long as well, with the end of it tips extending. Three red clouds surround it below the shoulders. The giant coin emits a lot of Gigantamax power that surrounds the area with a golden gleam. Its desire for shiny objects increases to the point where it will cause damage to skyscraper windows and exterior walls for the sake of sharpening its claws.
Gigantamax Meowth is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Gold Rush.</description>

They live in fresh-water lakes and rivers, where they are seen gracefully swimming, especially at dusk. As the fastest swimmers out of all Pokémon, they can out swim even the most athletic of humans, though they often train with swimmers. As they are able to swim in severe storms, they are sometimes found rescuing people lost at sea from danger.</description>

In battle, it subtly undulates the spiral-shape on its belly to put the foe to sleep, using a type of hypnosis. It is also capable of easily escaping the grasp of foes due to its greasy skin. Poliwhirl`s spiral goes in the opposite direction of Poliwag`s. Poliwhirl`s mouth is no longer visible after evolution, but it is concluded that it moved to the center of its spiral, since it now sprays water from there.
In the Pokémon anime, Misty had a Poliwhirl in the Johto series, which later evolved into Politoed. Red owns one in the Pokémon adventures which eventually it evolves into a Poliwrath.</description>

<description>Abra (Hocus in English-language beta versions of Pokémon Red and Blue) is a vaguely fox-like psychic Pokémon, which is always depicted to be sleeping in a sitting position. The brown upper torso seems to be armored and it appears to wear two pauldrons.
Abra are described as sleeping eighteen hours a day to conserve their psychic abilities. They also constantly use teleportation while asleep; changing their location once an hour, teleporting away when they sense danger or are attacked, and creating illusory copies of themselves. This constant use of teleportation is Abra`s defining characteristic in the video games.
In the Pokémon anime, Abra appears several times, first in Episode 21, Abra and the Psychic showdown, where it is used by the Saffron City gym leader and evolves into Kadabra. Abra has also appeared in the episode Psychic Vs. Ghost! Midnight Showdown, where he appears to have a main role in the episode.</description>

<description>Kadabra is a strong psychic Pokemon that owes much of its power to the alpha waves it emits from its body at all times. These alpha waves are affected by Kadabra`s current mental state - if it has a headache, the waves change. The psychic power it gives off can also trigger off headaches to nearby humans. It is also said to grow more powerful when faced with a difficult opponent. The silver spoon that Kadabra holds amplifies the waves` power - if it does not hold a spoon, it is said to be limited to half the usual amount of its telekinetic powers. It has been claimed that one morning, a boy with extrasensory powers woke up to find that he had become a Kadabra, but this has not been verified (it could possibly be an urban legend in the Pokemon world due the way it is told in the Pokedex, or a tongue-in-cheek reference to the way Uri Geller supposedly discovered his "psychic" powers - see below).
The alpha waves are described as being generated when all of a Kadabra`s brain cells work together or when Kadabra suffer from headaches. Kadabra are noted for being able to double the amount of alpha particles at will. The alpha waves can cause headaches in others and even cause machines to malfunction.
In November of 2000 it was reported that Uri Geller, an Israeli "psychic"-magician who claims to bend spoons with his mind, sued Nintendo over the Pokemon "Yungerer" (renamed Kadabra in English localizations) which he claimed was an unauthorized appropriation of his identity. The Pokemon in question has psychic abilities and carries bent spoons. He also claimed that the star on Kadabra`s forehead, and the lightning patterns on its abdomen, are symbolisms popular with the Waffen SS of Nazi Germany, and was outraged at the connotations that Nintendo had supposedly made. Although the symbols are derived from Zener cards, the name is a pun; the katakana n (ン) resembles the kana ri (リ) (the translation of Mr. Geller`s name into Katakana would be ユリゲラー Yuri Geraa). Geller sued for the equivalent of $100 million, but lost.</description>

<description>Alakazam loses the thick tail it once possessed as Kadabra (which might explain why it is 19 pounds lighter than Kadabra). It stands on two legs and always holds two silver spoons. Parts of Alakazam`s body are brown, but its predominant coloring is gold. Alakazam has a long, gold moustache - nonetheless, some Alakazam are female, though in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, females have dramatically smaller moustaches, while the males have longer ones.
Alakazam are described as extremely intelligent. With an IQ of 5,000, they can outperform supercomputers and can memorize anything. Alakazam use their superior intelligence to immediately identify their opponents` weaknesses and gain the edge in battles. This intelligence and superb memory are said to come from the fact that Alakazam`s brain cells never stop multiplying - as a result, the overly large head must be supported by its telekinetic powers. In fact, Alakazam use their psychic abilities to watch all "movement", as their muscles are too weak. Also their senses are incredibly strong: just by closing its eyes it can heighten all the other senses dramatically. Alakazam evolves from Kadabra when you trade it to another Pokémon game.
Alakazam is notable for having the highest Special Attack among non-legendary Pokémon, a statistic that affects the power of mental, fluid, and energy-based attacks, though it shares this title with another Pokémon, Porygon-Z. To balance its extremely high Special Attack, Alakazam`s other stats are atrocious, save for its high speed and average Special Defence, though this is offset by an awful HP stat. Alakazam made an appearance in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, as the leader of Team ACT.</description>

<description>Machoke evolves from Machop at Level 28. An interesting fact about Machoke is when seen in its "shiny" version, it shares a striking resemblance to that of The Hulk, being green in color.
Machoke`s name is a portmanteau of macho, meaning tough, and choke. The Japanese name Goriky is a pun on the Japanese word for superhuman strength (剛力) or godlike strength. Its name was originally "Kong-Fuu" in beta English versions of Red and Blue, which is a reference to Kung fu. Its signature moves include submission, cross chop and dynamic punch.
Machoke, along with its evolved form Machamp, is nicknamed as one of the bodybuilders of the Pokémon world, due to its humanoid appearance, huge muscles and the fact that it wears black speedos, and the belt round its waist makes it look similar to a wrestler (which is most probably what the pokemon was based on). The belt is known as a "Power Save" belt, which keeps Machoke`s power under control and helps to regulate its motions. The explanations of the belt`s purpose vary, but is quoted that because it is so dangerous, no one has ever attempted to remove it.
Machoke has had relatively few anime appearances, most of which were in the Jouto region, most notably in "Machoke, Machoke Man!", in which Machoke was Chuck`s signature Pokemon, and shared a very close bond with its trainer, who sparred and even used submission on during training. Machoke also appear as employed heavy lifters and construction workers, and can also be seen in the beginning of the games Pokémon Saphire and Ruby where a group of Machoke are seen carrying furniture into the players home, which are replaced by Vigoroth in pokemon Emerald.
Despite being measured at 4`11" in the Pokedex, whenever Machoke appear in the anime, they are always around the same height, or taller than, an adult male.</description>

<description>Machamp is a Fighting-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Machoke when traded. It is the final form of Machop. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Machamp is a large, humanoid Pokémon with four well-muscled arms. It has bluish gray skin, red eyes, and pale yellow lips. On its head, there are three brown ridges right above its eyes. It has two arms on each side of its body: a pair located in the normal position, and another pair directly above that attaches on the top of the shoulders. It has black markings that resemble briefs and wears golden power-save belt that resembles a championship belt. Its legs have considerable muscle tone, and its feet have two toes each.
Machamp punches extremely fast, throwing five hundred punches a second. With only one hand, it can move a mountain. Because of its four arms, it can hit from a multitude of angles and pin all of its foe`s limbs at once. Its arms also allow it to attack and defend simultaneously. The four arms react faster before Marchamp think. However, it has poor dexterity, and cannot handle delicate work without its arms becoming tangled. It is a rash Pokémon that rushes into action without forethought. Being the result of an evolution via trading, Machamp is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in the mountains. In the past, it claimed Low Kick, Vital Throw, and Strength as signature moves.
As Gigantamax Machamp, it has become larger with several changes. Its blueish-gray skin becomes darker. The middle ridge located on head becomes longer compare to the other two. All three ridges are also darker now. The neck extends with black markings. The fours fists are now colored dark orange with yellow lines connecting to two orange spots on each arm. The golden belt extends with several more dots. The P in the middle of the belt is colored white and connected to a single yellow circle with nothing in between. The black markings on its leg extend to the legs but stopping near the ankle.
Due to Gigantamaxing, the arms are filled with power, the punches it makes can hit as hard as bomb blasts. There is a legend where Gigantamax Machamp saved a large ship that was in trouble before bringing it to a port.
Gigantamax Machamp is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Chi Strike.</description>

<description>Bellsprout is a carnivorous, flower-like Pokémon, hunting small insects with blinding agility despite its skinny body. It is said to ensnare its prey in its vines and devour it, and can also spit a highly corrosive fluid that can melt even iron. Bellsprout`s preferred habitat is warm and humid climates, since it can absorb more moisture from the ground by planting its root-like feet. In battle, Bellsprout can take advantage of its flexibility to bend and sway its way out of the range of its opponent`s attacks, no matter how powerful they may be.
In the video games, Bellsprout is commonly found among grassy routes, and is used by many Trainers who favor the Grass-type. In Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, the Sprout Tower in Violet City is dedicated to Bellsprout.
Bellsprout has appeared numerous times in the anime series, most notably in "The Fourth Round Rumble," where Ash battled one during the Indigo League. He eventually defeated it with Muk.</description>

<description>Weepinbell is a bell-like Pokémon that resembles its pre-evolution Bellsprout, but without the vines and leaves. Instead of walking, it hops along or hangs on to tree branches and vines using the large hook on its rear end. Weepinbell immobilizes its enemies by using Poisonpowder and Acid. It will swallow anything that moves and digest it within its stomach, and produces a neutralizing fluid to keep from being affected by its own strong stomach acids. If its prey is larger than it, it will first use sharp leaves to slice it up before eating.
Players can obtain a Weepinbell by catching it in the wild, evolving Bellsprout upon reachng level 21, or Snagging a Shadow Weepinbell in Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness. In Pokémon Ranger, enemy Weepinbell can swallow the protagonist whole, knocking him or her back to the beginning of the area.
Weepinbell has appeared in relatively few episodes in the Pokémon anime. It first appeared in "The School of Hard Knocks," and later when Celadon City Gym Leader Erika battled Ash with one. James` Victreebel was also briefly seen as a Weepinbell.</description>

<description>Victreebel is a carnivorous Pokémon based on the pitcher plant. It lulls its prey with a sweet, honey-like scent, and also the vine on its head (which waves as if it were an animal) before digesting it with powerful stomach acids that can even dissolve bone. Normally, its prey are bugs, but it has been known to attack and consume small animals. Victreebel cannot be caught in the wild in any of the Pokémon video games; it must be evolved from Weepinbell with a Leaf Stone.
In the anime, James of Team Rocket had a Weepinbell which evolved into Victreebel in the episode "The Breeding Center Secret." As a running gag, it usually tried to eat him as soon as it emerged from its Poké Ball (this tradition of James`s Grass-type Pokémon hurting him was continued by Cacnea in the Advanced Generation series, and Carnivine in the Diamond and Pearl series). While most Pokèmon speak in a vocabulary consisting of its own name, Victreebel, like Lapras, communicates through loud, high-pitched shrieks.</description>

<description>Tentacool (メノクラゲ, Menokurage?) is an aquatic Pokémon based on the box jellyfish. It drifts aimlessly wherever the ocean currents take it, sometimes ending up in shallow waters where it may be accidentally caught in fishing lines. Tentacool may also end up stuck on beaches when low tide comes; since its body is largely composed of water, it will shrivel up, risking death from dehydration if it stays out of the sea for too long. Tentacool has two main weapons. At the tips of its tentacles are toxic feelers, which it uses to stab anything it touches with stinging acid. Due to its excellent camouflage in the water, Tentacool can often remain undetected by swimmers right up to the moment it stings them. Tentacool`s gelatinous, watery body can also absorb sunlight and refract it within, producing beam energy it shoots from its crystal-like eyes.
Tentacool is available in all Pokémon games to date. It is extremely common, especially while surfing on sea routes, and is in almost every single body of water.
In the anime, Tentacool was featured in the episode "Tentacool and Tentacruel" in which a raging mob of the titular Pokémon attacked the Porta Vista resort. The episode was banned after the attacks on September 11, 2001 due to its scenes depicting Tentacools and Tentacruels destroying buildings at a seaside resort.</description>

<description>"Tentacruel" is probably a portmanteau of "tentacle", the reason for which is obvious, and the adjective "cruel", referring to its personality. The name may have something to do with the deep-sea jellyfish called Tentaculata. Its name was originally going to be Man-O-War, which refers to the Portuguese man o` war. The Japanese name, "Dokukurage," is a portmanteau, of 毒 doku (poison) and 水母 kurage (jellyfish). It resembles its pre-evolution Tentacool to a small degree - the "head" of Tentacool has now been made into a hat-like shape on top of a black orb containing its eyes and two very large hooks which resembles a long nose. Also, unlike Tentacool, it has up to 80 tentacles, most of which are hidden, leaving up to 14 exposed.</description>

<description>Geodude has a rock for a head, no nose, and two long arms that start with a bulging muscle and end with rock hands resembling a human`s. Geodude most frequently are found in fields and on mountains. People step or trip on them from time to time, mistaking them for rocks. Its arms are so strong that it can use them to climb mountains. Rhyperior sometimes accidentally shoot Geodude from their cannon-like arms. Geodudes are one of the few Pokémon to have appeared in every Pokémon game.
In the video games, Geodude is commonly found inside caves and mountains, and sometimes appears when Rock Smash is used. Geodude are also found in the Nintendo 64 game Pokémon Snap, hanging from mountainsides by their arms. In the Super Smash Bros. Melee battlefield "Poké Floats", a Geodude is the last float the fighters ride on before returning to the Squirtle float.
Geodude is a recurring character in the Pokémon anime. It first appeared in the fifth episode, "Showdown in Pewter City," used by Gym Leader Brock to battle Ash. Brock became a travel companion of Ash and owned Geodude for the first five seasons. Navel Island Gym Leader Danny and Rustboro City Gym Leader Roxanne have also used Geodude. In the anime, Geodude is able to levitate above the ground.
Geodude`s name comes from the word "Geode" as in a rock with a sparkly inside, and "Dude," usually used to describe a certain kind of male person.</description>

<description>Graveler resembles a large boulder with four arms and two legs. It lives and feeds on rocky mountains. It will climb the slope of a mountain daily, snacking on small rocks along the way, and roll back down once it has reached the peak. Though it is not very fast when walking, a Graveler rolling down a mountain trail is a very dangerous thing to encounter. Carefree by nature, Graveler ignores most obstacles that may appear in its path, such as grass, trees, boulders or even hikers, since it can roll through or over them more often than not. It is not essentially harmed rolling down the slope, even if the odd jutting piece of its body gets broken off. Machop are known to use Graveler as training weights.</description>

Golem inhabits rocky mountains and volcanoes, often disguising itself as an inanimate boulder. It will annually shed its skin like a reptile, with its new shell often being bigger than the one before. Its body is almost impenetrable, able to withstand dynamite blasts; it can even detonate its own body, launching itself great distances in order to travel from mountain to mountain. When earthquakes occur near where Golem live, they will tumble down mountains, rolling at an incredible speed.
In the video games, the only way to obtain Golem is to evolve a Graveler by trading it to another player.
Golem has made numerous appearances in the Pokémon anime. It first appeared in the episode "The Bridge Bike Gang," in which Chopper, the leader of a bicycle gang, uses one to battle Ash`s Charmander.
Golem`s name comes from the word "golem," which is a humanoid clay or stone statue associated with Jewish mysticism.</description>

<description>Ponyta is a Fire-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves into Rapidash starting at level 40.
In Galar, Ponyta has a Psychic-type regional form. It evolves into Galarian Rapidash starting at level 40.
Ponyta is an equine Pokémon with cream-colored fur. It has brown eyes and triangular ears with reddish interiors. Yellow and reddish-orange flames form its mane and tail. The mane forms a short crest on top of its head and a short strip down its back to its tail. Additional flames are present behind its elbows and knees. The fire appears about an hour after hatching. It has four long legs, each ending in a single, gray hoof. These hooves are said to be harder than diamonds.
Ponyta has extraordinary jumping abilities and is capable of leaping tall buildings in a single bound. However, a newborn Ponyta is a weak runner and is actually barely able to stand. It gradually strengthens its legs and becomes faster by chasing after its parents. In the anime, it is shown that Ponyta can control its flames so that its rider is not burned by them. Ponyta live in grasslands, on plains, or anywhere that it can run freely.
In the Galar region, Ponyta has adapted to forests by being exposed to the life energy from it. It has chalk-white fur; long, purple-and-blue, cloudy fur that is also on top of its dark-purple hooves; purple eyes with light-blue irises; and a purple-and-white horn on top of its forehead. Galarian Ponyta can absorb the life energy located in the atmosphere and store it in its mane, which will then become more colorful and potentially release a shining glow if there is a lot of energy to use. The small horn contains a healing power. Ponyta can heal any slight wounds with a few rubs from its horn. By looking it the eyes of a person, it can read the contents of the heart. Should Ponyta find any evil, it will promptly go back into hiding.</description>

In Galar, Rapidash has a Psychic/Fairy-type regional form. It evolves from Galarian Ponyta starting at level 40.
Rapidash is an equine Pokémon with cream-colored fur and a pointed horn on its forehead. It has small, red eyes and triangular ears with reddish interiors. Yellow and reddish-orange flames stream from the back of its head to form a long, flowing mane. A short version of the mane trails down its back to its equally fiery tail. Flames are also present on its fetlocks. It has slender legs, each with a single black hoof.
Rapidash is a very agile Pokémon. It runs at about 150 mph (240 km/h), chasing everything that moves in hopes of racing it. With incredible acceleration, it reaches its top speed in only ten steps. At full gallop, its hooves barely touch the ground. The faster Rapidash goes, the longer the swaying flames of its mane will become. At an all-out gallop, its blazing mane sparkles, a feature which is said to enhance its beautiful appearance. Rapidash lives in grasslands, but it can also be seen on mountains in Pokémon Snap.</description>

It evolves into Slowbro starting at level 37 or Slowking when traded holding a King`s Rock.
In Galar, Slowpoke has a pure Psychic-type regional form, introduced in Pokémon Sword and Shield`s 1.1.0 patch. It will evolve into Galarian Slowbro using an item found on the Isle of Armor or Galarian Slowking using an item found in the Crown Tundra.
Slowpoke is a pink Pokémon that resembles a cross between a salamander and a hippopotamus. It has vacant eyes that never seem focused, curled ears, and a rounded, tan muzzle. It has four legs, each of which ends in a single white claw. Its long, tapering tail has a white tip. This tail drips a sweet, sappy substance that is attractive to many species of fish. Slowpoke uses the tail as a fishing lure. The tail often breaks off, but it will grow back. In Alola, its tail is often dried and used in home cooked stews.
Slowpoke has notoriously dim intellect, and often forgets what it was doing. It takes a long time to respond to outside stimuli. For example, it can take up to five seconds to process pain and can take an entire day to notice when its tail has been bitten. Slowpoke is commonly found at the water`s edge. In some places, it is believed that Slowpoke`s yawn causes rain. This Pokémon is worshiped in those areas.
In Galar, Slowpoke gains yellow markings on its forehead and tail.</description>

<description>Slowbro is a slow and dopey Pokémon that evolves from Slowpoke. Its name a portmanteau of slow (as in "slow-witted") and bro (as in "brother", probably relating to the fraternal relationship it shares with the Shellder on its tail). Slowpoke becomes Slowbro when a Shellder clamps down on its tail, yet it is so slow and dopey it is sometimes unaware of the change until it gets out of the water. Its Japanese name is most likely derived from 宿借り yadokari (hermit crab). The Shellder which bites on its tail sucks on the aforementioned syrup, and so it is hard to remove. Also toxins which leak from the bite pass into Slowbro, which numbs its immunity to pain even more. The relationship between Slowpoke and Shellder is symbiotic; being attached to the Slowpoke enables the Shellder to travel on land, whereas the weight of the Shellder on its tail enables the Slowpoke to walk on its hind legs, freeing the use of its arms.</description>

<description>Magnemite is almost more of a machine than a creature, as it is a solid ball of metal with a pair of horseshoe magnets on either side, as well as a single, lidless eye. It has a pair of screws protruding from below the eye, and a large screw forming a sort of "cap" on top of its head.
It floats through the air, through a sort of electromagnetic antigravity field generated by the two magnets on either side of its body. When defending itself in the wild or fighting in a Pokémon battle at the orders of a Pokémon trainer, it can also generate powerful electric shocks. Magnemite consumes electricity, so they`re attracted to power lines and electronic gadgets. Magnemite tend to crowd around generators and power plants, and an individual Magnemite might be attracted to someone with a pocket radio or a Pokégear.
Despite their mechanical appearance, lack of gender, and alien tendencies, Magnemite are living things; they are not built, they feel the need to eat, and they have something similar to a mating urge. A trio of Magnemite may come together to create their evolved form, Magneton.</description>

<description>Farfetch`d is a dual-type Normal/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
In Galar, Farfetch`d has a Fighting-type regional form. Galarian Farfetch`d evolves into Sirfetch`d after landing three critical hits in a single battle, regardless of if it faints.
Farfetch`d is an avian Pokémon that resembles a light brown duck with a white underbelly. It has a flat, yellow beak, brown eyes, a V-shaped black marking on its forehead similar to a unibrow, and a three-feather crest on top of its head. Its wings are as big as its body and appear to be prehensile enough to substitute for hands. It has yellow legs with webbed feet and a stubby tail.
Farfetch`d is always seen carrying a leek stalk or spring onion. It carries this sprig in its wings, but sometimes chooses to hold it in its beak or feet instead. Unable to live without its stick, Farfetch`d will defend the stalk with its life. Losing it can leave Farfetch`d defenseless. Known uses for the stick include use as a weapon, nesting material, and emergency food source. It is selective about which sticks it will use and has been known to fight over good ones. Farfetch`d is found in temperate grasslands.
Galarian Farfetch`d is a deeper shade of brown, with a more prominent black mark on its head. As the leeks in Galar are much larger than those elsewhere, it carries its leek over its wing in order to better manage its heavy weight. It is renowned for its courage in battle.
Farfetch`d and its evolution Sirfetch`d are the only Pokémon capable of using the Leek item.</description>

<description>Doduo resembles an ostrich or a roadrunner, with sharper beaks and an extra head. It may also be based on the kiwi. Its name is a portmanteau of the words dodo, the extinct flightless bird, and duo, in reference to its two heads. Doduo`s tracks are huge and very distinctive. It inhabits and races across grass-covered plains at 60 mph. It is well-adapted to dry and arid climates. Doduo`s second head is said to have been formed by a sudden mutation thousands of years ago. Both heads normally contain identical brains, although rare cases have been observed where a Doduo has two distinctly different brains.
Interestingly, Doduo can be caught in the wild in all of the Pokémon video games. Doduo can also be found in Pokémon Snap.
In the Pokémon anime episode "Bad to the Bone," Jessie of Team Rocket battles a Doduo with her Arbok. The battle is interrupted when the Doduo`s heads begin to fight with each other.</description>

<description>Dodrio is a flightless bird Pokémon with long, powerful legs. Dodrio resembles an ostrich, and its movement is reminiscent of the roadrunner. Its name is a portmanteau of the words dodo, the extinct flightless bird, and trio, in reference to its three heads.
As the evolved form of the two-headed Doduo, Dodrio has three heads, the third head which is said to be formed by one of Doduo`s heads splitting during evolution. Each one of the heads constantly expresses a different emotion: joy, sadness, and anger. Having three heads allows Dodrio to collect more information from its surroundings, develop complex plans, and remain alert at all times by keeping watch in three different directions. On the other hand, a Dodrio`s three heads are commonly known to squabble amongst themselves, probably due to each one having a different attitude. Though Dodrio struggles to fly, it has three sets of hearts and lungs to match its heads, granting it extraordinary stamina while running at high speed. Like its pre-evolution Doduo, it inhabits dry, grassy plains.
In the video games, Dodrio are often used by Bird Keepers and Triathletes practicing in running. In Pokémon Ranger, a Dodrio is the partner of the Fall City Ranger Leader Joel. Dodrio also features in the Pokémon Stadium games as Dodrio Mode, which speeds up the games` GameBoy emulator, and in FireRed, LeafGreen, and Emerald in the mini-game Dodrio Berry-Picking.
In the Pokémon anime, Dodrio first appeared on the morning of the first episode, crowing in place of a rooster. Dario used one in the episode "The Flame Pokémon-athon," and Violet City Gym Leader Falkner battled Ash`s Pikachu with one. Gary Oak also evolved his Doduo into a Dodrio.</description>

<description>Seel are well suited to life in the most frigid reaches of the planet. They are nocturnal; in the daytime they are seen asleep on the seabed in shallow water. When hunting, Seel stay in the ocean because they cannot walk on land. Instead, they swim in a rather graceful fashion literally underneath sheets of ice floating on the water`s surface in their environment in search of their prey. Even though the air is a frigid 14 degrees Fahrenheit and the water itself is a somewhat less chilling 40 degrees, their fur hides are thick enough to insulate Seel from either degree of cold and their nostrils automatically close by themselves to ensure their ability to remain underwater. When they need to take in air, they will use their hard horns to punch holes through the ice sheet above and pop their heads out.</description>

<description>Grimer is composed primarily of putrid, hardened sludge and grime. It smells incredibly foul, and can influence the abandonment of entire cities due to its polluting nature--even weeds don`t grow where a Grimer has appeared. Grimer thrives in filthy areas, such as factories, garbage dumps, sewers and polluted water systems. It survives and matures by sucking up polluted sludge that is pumped out of factories, adding toxic waste to its already toxic girth. It enters sewers and other areas with great ease due to its rubbery and semi-viscous body; for example, it can enter barred-off areas by slipping between the narrow bars. If a person stuck his hand in a Grimer, that person would have a difficult time pulling it out from its body.</description>

<description>Muk is a living manifestation of sludge and waste. Muk thrives in toxic waste and garbage. It inhabits any polluted area; including abandoned factories, garbage dumps and sewers. It is said that its smell is comparable to that of reeking kitchen garbage, especially during hot summers. Muk itself is also a source of pollution. As Muk slides across the ground, it leaves behind a trail of highly poisonous sludge. Muk and Grimer are known for traveling into water and polluting it and killing plants with their sludge. Muk could be considered antagonistic of Suicune, a Pokémon with the ability to purify dirty or polluted water. It can also be considered antagonistic of Celebi, which can bring dead plants back to life.
In the anime, Ash and friends encounter a horde of Grimer, which is led by a Muk. After a group of Magnemits and Magnetons save them, Ash captures the Muk. When Ash first caught Muk, its smell was able to escape the Poké Ball, much to everyone`s displeasure. For this reason, Muk was given to Professor Oak. A running gag in the series involves Muk and his overly affectionate personality. He constantly expressing gratitude towards Professor Oak by hugging him, and in the process smothering him with its gooey body, he also started to do this with Professor Birch.</description>

<description>Shellder is a cheeky bivalve (oyster or clam) Pokémon; it constantly pokes its tongue out at anybody, whether friend or foe. It will also spit on foes. This tends to antagonize enemies into a rage. Its shell is very strong, apparently harder than a diamond, though only made of a single, smooth layer. Shellder becomes vulnerable when the enemy can attack its insides. When not protecting itself in battle, it will attack by squirting water at the foe. As a last resort, it will clamp the foe with its powerful shell. However, this leaves Shellder vulnerable to an attack, hence, it is rarely used. As a total last resort, Shellder may use Selfdestruct or Explosion to knock itself and the enemy out. Shellder travels by rapidly opening and closing its shell, propelling it in the opposite direction of its shell through the water. Shellder are incapable of travel on land, unless in a Poké Ball.
Shellder is integral to the evolution of Slowpoke as is the body part of Slowpoke to which Shellder bites on: its tail. Once Shellder bites the Slowpoke`s tail, the two will evolve into a single Pokémon, Slowbro. If Shellder instead attaches itself to Slowpoke`s head, it will create Slowking, a notably smarter Pokémon than the other two. This evolution can be reversed if Shellder falls off Slowbro`s tail or Slowking`s head. The evolution benefits both Pokémon: Slowpoke can now walk on its hind legs and Shellder can both eat the scraps of the Slowpoke, and finally move on land. The newly attached Shellder looks very different from its previous purple form.</description>

<description>Cloyster are bivalve Pokémon, guarded by an extremely strong, multi-layered shell. This shells cannot be opened even by those with superior strength, and they cannot be damaged even by a bomb. Nobody has seen their dark innards, which are Cloyster`s weak spot as they are very soft and vulnerable. They launch thick, powerful spikes at enemies in battle, as well as to capture prey. These spikes are even stronger than their shell. Cloyster can also crush prey by clamping their thick shell shut onto them. When being attacked, they simply shut their shells to avoid further damage. To travel through water, they swim by swallowing water and jetting it out opposite to the direction they want to move.</description>

<description>Gastly (Spirit in the Beta versions of the English language versions of Pokémon Red and Blue) is made of a very thin, gas-like substance, which grants it certain powers and weaknesses. Some say it is an other-dimensional lifeform, while others believe it is formed from toxic gas. It can sneak into any place if it so wishes thanks to the invasive properties of gas molecules. It can render itself nearly invisible and approach enemies undetected, and can envelop said enemies regardless of their size and induce sleepiness, slow poisoning through the skin, or even suffocation.
On the other hand, Gastly`s negligible weight and gaseous nature make it very easy for it to be blown off or even scattered to nothingness under a strong wind (although it is presumed the molecules can regroup later). A Gastly will not appear in windy weather if it can help it, but when it finds itself threatened by a strong wind, it clusters in groups under the eaves of houses to protect itself.</description>

However, when approached by people, it has a habit of reverting to a spherical form that obscures its eyes, mouth, and hands. Haunter is considered in the Pokédex to be a `gas type` Pokémon, because of the overall structure of his body. Because of its ability to slip through block walls, Haunter is said to be from another dimension. They seem to eat by first paralyzing their opponent with Lick, then draining a bit of their life force, although it`s possible they may eat other food as well, such things like Pokéblocks. It is also said to eat people`s dreams by going inside them and scaring them to death. It is the lightest of all discovered pokemon.</description>

<description>Gengar is a dual-type Ghost/Poison Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Haunter when traded. It is the final form of Gastly. It can Mega Evolve into Mega Gengar using the Gengarite. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Gengar is a dark purple, bipedal Pokémon with a roundish body. It has red eyes, a wide mouth that is usually curled into a sinister grin, and pointed ears. On its back are numerous spikes and it has smaller spikes on top of its head similar to tufty fur. Its arms and legs are short with three digits on both its hands and feet. It also has a stubby tail.
Gengar has the ability to hide perfectly in the shadow of any object, granting it exceptional stealth. However, Gengar`s body acts as a heat sink. Its presence cools the temperature of the surrounding area by nearly 10°F (5°C), because it absorbs the warmth. The anime has shown that Gengar can fly and possess people and other Pokémon. In the past, Night Shade was its signature move.
Gengar is very mischievous, and at times, malicious. It enjoys playing practical jokes and casting curses, such as pretending to be one`s shadow, then behaving erratically. When the quarry notices, the Gengar takes delight in its victim`s terror. However, Gengar has been known to be loyal to a Trainer who treats it well. Being the result of an evolution via trading, Gengar is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in caves and dark places where shadows form. It is especially fond of urban areas such as cities and back alleys, but only during the night.
As Mega Gengar, a portion of its body sinks into the ground and its arms and tail lengthen. The lower portions turn a more reddish purple, and a third eye appears on its forehead. This new unblinking eye is oval, yellow, and allows it to see into other dimensions. The spikes on Mega Gengar`s back are more numerous and pointed and additional spikes appear on its hands and tail. Its ears are now considerably longer and tilt backward.
Mega Gengar has the ability to access other dimensions and has a vicious nature. Mega Gengar has no itnerests in opponents unless perceived as prey. Its relationships are warped due to Mega Evolution. It now desires to take the life and curse anyone or anything in its path It may even curse its own Trainer. Mega Gengar sinks into an another dimension to wait for a chance to attack.
As Gigantamax Genger, it becomes larger with portions of its body sinking into ground. Only the head, tail, and arms remain. Also it changes to from a dark purple to lighter purple. The eyes change to the color white with yellow sclera. The inside of the mouth changes to resemble a tunnel with a long purple tounge sticking out. Three red clouds surrounds the top of Gengar’s head.
There’s a rumor where Gigantamax Gengar’s mouth does not lead into its body. Due the cursed energy, it’s believed to instead lead into the afterlife. By laying a trap, it hope to steal the lives of those it captures. Should someone stand near its mouth, they can hear the voices of their loved ones calling out to them.
Gigantamax Gengar is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Terror.</description>

<description>Onix is a subterranean creature that bores its way through the ground at a rate of 50 mph (80 km/h) in search of food. The tunnels it leaves behind as it burrows through the earth are used as pre-dug homes by other subterranean Pokémon such as Diglett and Geodude. Within Onyx`s member is a structure nigh identical to a magnet, which allows it to determine its heading, its depth underground, and other such information useful for a subterranean Pokémon to know. It acts quite like a compass. As Onix ages, it burrows deeper underground, and its rocky member becomes progressively harder, rounder, and smoother. Around the age of 100, the pressures exerted on its stone member become so high that it is compressed into a much harder, diamond-like composition, although it is closer to metal in nature.
In the anime, an Onix is owned by Brock as part of the many Pokemon owned by the training gym that Brock`s family runs. Brock had initially received the Onix from his father, who is a specialist in rock-type Pokemon. When Brock feels the need to travel with Ash Ketchum yet again, he entrusts the care of the Onix to one of his many younger brothers. This takes place in Pokémon Chronicles. It eventually evolves into a Steelix.</description>

<description>Drowzee is a creature with an elephant`s trunk, the body and color pattern of a tapir, and a hunger for dreams, traits that characterize Drowzee. Its name comes from the English word "drowsy", which reflects on the fact that Drowzee`s primary ability is to put foes to sleep. The "-zee" comes from the sleeping phrase "ZzZzZ". Its Japanese name, Sleepe, is a corruption of the English word sleep. Drowzee`s original biology was based on the tapir and its appearance and dream-eating behavior are inspired by the Japanese folkloric creature Baku. However, its nature is much unlike the real-world animal it was based on.
Drowzee eats dreams; in order to eat, it must put its prey to sleep. A nightmare or night terror will give it indigestion, and it prefers the dreams of human children to those of adults or other pokémon. It`s psychic, but it has limited abilities, compared to other Pokémon; it does not display telekinesis, for example. However, its telepathy allows it to detect people who are asleep, even while asleep itself. Its memory when it comes to dreams is eidetic, and it has the ability to show anyone any dream it has eaten. If one thinks he/she had a good dream, but is unable to remember it, it was possibly eaten by a Drowzee.</description>

<description>Hypno is a humanoid creature with a fur covering its neck, and always carrying its favorite pendulum in its hand, which it uses to put others to sleep. The name "Hypno" originates from the word "hypnosis", as Hypno hypnotizes foes with its pendulum.
Hypno is a curiously sinister Pokémon that puts other Pokémon and people to sleep. It does so by swinging the pendulum, which it carries in its hand all the time. When hunting for prey, it will polish the mysterious pendulum.
Eating the dreams of its foes is another sinister ability of Hypno. However, stomach pains will ail Hypno if it eats a nightmare. At dusk, some Hypno will appear near schools and less-traveled roads. This may be to scare children and travelers at night and hypnotize them. In fact, there was once an incident where Hypno hypnotized and kidnapped a child.
It is possible that Hypno never sleeps, as evident by its Insomnia ability. Instead of sleeping, it probably energizes itself with meditation and by eating the dreams of those it puts to sleep. Hypno`s menacing and semi-parted eyelids look sleep deprived.</description>

<description>Krabby is a crab with large pincers. Krabby is an omnivore and a scavenger; it rarely hunts for itself. It can also act as a filter feeder by digesting the bacteria in sand, but this is rare. It is territorial, and in beaches where there is little food, fights between Krabby are common. Krabby also uses camouflage; it can form mucus sacs about itself if threatened, making it seem larger or making it harder to spot against sea sand. It is usually very small, but it makes up by its aggressiveness.
Krabby first appeared at a beach in episode 13, Mystery At The Lighthouse, when Ash Ketchum wanted to prove that he could catch a Pokémon alone. After the capture (which involved Krabby attacking Ash`s finger), it was automatically transferred to Professor Oak`s lab, because Ash already had six Pokémon with him. To Ash`s great surprise, Gary had also caught another Krabby, which was much larger than his. Ash used Krabby in his first battle at the Indigo Tournament. Krabby won against an Exeggutor and evolved into Kingler, despite the fact that Krabby had never battled before.</description>

<description>Kingler is a Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Krabby starting at level 28. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Kingler is a crustacean Pokémon resembling a crab. Its strong shell covers the outside of its body, featuring a red upper half and a light tan lower half. Its upper half is topped with six tall, thin spikes that resemble a crown. Its light tan arms are also connected to its upper body. Its lower half doubles as its jaw with six fangs overlapping its upper body. Its two outer fangs are much larger than the inner four and are roughly half as tall as Kingler`s entire body. Its hips visibly protrude from its lower body and connect to its four long, thin legs. Each leg has a single, claw-like foot. Kingler`s main feature is its red pincers. Its left claw is roughly twice as large as the other and hard as steel.
Kingler is often found on the edges of water, usually the ocean. It its powerful claws have 10,000 horsepower and are capable of prying open the shells of Shellder and Cloyster. While Kingler`s large, left claw is its main tool for offensive maneuvers, it is so large and heavy that Kingler can barely lift it. It causes balancing problems and Kingler may quickly become fatigued from continuous use. However, it has been shown to communicate with other Kingler by waving its pincers around. In the past, Crabhammer was its signature move.
Gigantamax Kingler is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Foam Burst.</description>

<description>Voltorb are aggressive red and white ball shaped Pokémon that looks strikingly similar to a Poké Ball. Coincidently it was discovered shortly after Poké Balls were invented, some believe there is a connection. Though roughly ten times larger, many trainers get a surprise when they pick one up thinking it is a Poké Ball. The strength of their explosions is dependent on how much electricity they store in their bodies. When jarred or angered, a Voltorb can and will explode, causing massive damage to their aggressor and themselves (as seen in the video games when they use the moves `Self-Destruct` or `Explosion`, both of which causes fainting to the user). It is so unstable that even the slightest bump in the road will make it explode spontaneously. Voltorb do not have a mouth, but do have two eyes that are normally slanted into an aggressive or angry stare.</description>

It instead uses its stored electric to increase its rolling speed. The amount of electricity in an Electrode is relative to how powerful its explosions are. The stored energy also generates strong static electricity around Electrode`s body, sometimes paralyzing enemies on contact. If it is bored, it often amuses itself by exploding. Electrode has two beady eyes and an almost nonstop grin.</description>

Exeggcute`s name is a play on the phrase "eggs are cute." It is also a play on the word execute. Tamatama could be taken to mean 偶々, unexpectedly, although it is more likely to be derived from 玉 tama, sphere, doubled. It is worth noting that the Japanese word for egg is 卵 tamago. They use telepathic signals only they can receive to remain in their balanced formation; even if one is separated, it will quickly rejoin its swarm. Each member of the swarm have a different appearance in number of cracks, deformations, personalities and expression. Some Exeggcute can have such severe cracking and breakage that a Yolk can be seen inside. The middle body often has the fewest or no cracks at all, and is assumed to be the boss of the group.</description>

<description>Exeggutor`s name is believed to be derived from the name of its previous evolutionary stage (Exeggcute), whose name is derived from egg and the word execute so Exeggutor`s name is a combination of egg and executor.

The heads are considered fruit or nuts and each has a different expression on its face similar to Exeggcute. When an Exeggcute evolves into Exeggutor, any and all cracks and breaks are mended as they turn yellow and combine to form the new Exeggutor. Living in a good environment will allow it to grow lots of heads, and it is said that they occasionally fall off to form new Exeggcute.</description>

<description>Cubone`s name is a combination of the words cub and bone, in reference to its young age and relation to bones, both as weapons and armor. The "Cu-" may also be derived from cute, as Cubone is rather referred to as cute and lonely, or the derogatory term "cue ball", referring to a bald person, which is a reference to the skull it wears. Its Japanese name is most likely a pun on 空 kara (emptiness), 殻 kara (shell), and/or からから karakara (dried-up). In the Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow a Cubone is adopted by Mr. Fuji after its mother is killed by Team Rocket. Cubone is also a playable character in Pokémon Red Rescue Team and Pokémon Blue Rescue Team. The skull a Cubone wears on its head is said to be the skull of its mother, who dies whenever a Cubone is born. Because it never removes its skull helmet, no one has ever seen a Cubone`s actual face. Its cries for its mother are often heard echoing inside the skull.</description>

<description>Marowak`s name is a portmanteau of marrow and whack (to strike), with "marrow" to represent Marowak`s skull-like head, and "whack" to represent Marowak`s nature of striking its opponent with bones. Its Japanese name most likely refers to がらがら garagara, the onomatopoeia for "clattering," as in of bones. Marowak always carries a thick bone in its hand, which it bludgeons foes with. This Pokémon evolves from Cubone and, unlike Cubone, hides its feelings of despair for its loss mother with anger. In Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow a Marowak`s ghost haunts the Pokémon Tower in Lavender Town. Team Rocket is indicated by Cubone`s caretaker to have been the cause of the death. Unlike the skull helmet on a Cubone, a Marowak`s skull helmet is tightly fitted over its face.</description>

<description>Hitmonlee is a fighting type Pokémon that evolves from Tyrogue. Hitmonlee`s name is a combination of hit (suggesting its role as a martial arts pokémon), mon (a common abbreviation for `monster` in various collectible monster games, such as Digimon and Pokémon), and lee (an allusion to actor and martial artist Bruce Lee). Its Japanese name is most likely a reference to Tadashi Sawamura. Hitmonlee`s anatomy, a humanoid with no discernible head who instead has a face on his chest, is similar to that of the classical Blemmyes. Hitmonlee have a natural wrapping around their powerful legs. They have three fingers on each hand, but their hands are used mainly to maintain balance during kicks. Any punch or hand based moves bred into or learned by a Tyrogue will carry into either of its evolved forms. This means that even a Hitmonlee can be taught punching moves, such as Mach Punch and Fire Punch.</description>

<description>Weezing is a Poison-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Koffing starting at level 35.
In Galar, Weezing has a Poison/Fairy-type regional form. It evolves from Koffing starting at level 35. All Koffing in Galar evolve into this form regardless of their origin.
Weezing is a purple Pokémon consisting of two spherical heads connected by a thin tube with another sphere in the center. The heads have differing sizes and features. The left head is larger and has prominent eyebrows, pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw, and two flat teeth in its upper jaw. The smaller, right head simply has two pointed teeth, one at each corner of its mouth. The larger head has a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking below its face, while the smaller head has a ring marking instead. It is covered with many geyser-like protrusions, which usually expel mustard-colored gases. Weezing is said to form when poisonous gases pool and two Koffing fuse over many years. Very rarely, two Koffing can become a Weezing in a short timespan because of a sudden mutation. Triplet Weezing have been discovered, although they are extremely rare.
Each of Weezing`s heads contains a different toxin. It mixes its gases by inflating one head and deflating the other. When its gases mix, Weezing becomes more toxic and putrid. Weezing can hover in midair, presumably due to gases lighter than air, as is the case for Koffing. Despite their stench and poison, Weezing`s gases can be used to make top-grade perfume by diluting them to the highest level.
Weezing lives in urban areas. It seeks a dirty, unkempt house and nests there. At night, when the people in the house are asleep, it will go through the trash. Weezing feeds on the dust, microorganisms, and especially gases emitted by garbage and toxic waste. Weezing`s body expands and smells worse upon inhaling poisonous gases. The Kantoian Weezing used to be common in Galar and created more potent toxins than their Galarian relatives.
In the Galar region, its appearance has changed due to absorbing polluted air from factories. It has a grey body with with the skull, crossbones, and ring changed to color yellow. Both heads have a hat-like tube located on top of them that constantly release purified air. Five green puffs of poison gas clouds can be seen floating around it. The larger head has a cloud-like mustache, while the smaller has clouds on its face in the shape of eyebrows and a beard.
Galrian Weezing consumes particles from the polluted air. It expels clean air instead of droppings. The toxins within Weezing`s body are accumulated into poison gas clouds that leaks and drifts around it. The gas is Weezing`s best weapon in battle, being potent enough to stun and immobilize an opponent with just a whiff.
Galarian Weezing is the only known Pokémon capable of using the the move Strange Steam.</description>

<description>Rhyhorn is a rhinoceros like Pokemon with a rock like hide consisting of plates. Ryhorn stands on all four legs and evolves into Rhydon. Rhyhorn is a portmanteau of rhinoceros (which it resembles) and horn. Its spelling is also influenced by the rock rhyolite. Its Japanese name is a portmanteau of sai (犀), meaning rhinoceros and horn (ホーン). Rhyhorn are easily angered and will not hesitate to charge at what ever or who ever angered it. Rhyhorn are powerful enough to topple buildings with their tackle. Rhyhorn are prime examples of "more brawn than brains", as they often charge head first into things but forget why. In Gold, Silver, and Crystal, Brock uses a Rhyhorn to battle. There is also a Rhyhorn in the Brock Gym Leader set of the trading card game.</description>

<description>Rhydon appears to be a cross between a rhinoceros and a dinosaur. It is a massive, gray, bipedal creature with clawed forepaws and hindfeet and a long tail. Rhydon`s head has two horns: one is on its forehead, and another one at the end of its snout. The latter is bigger and seems to be styled after a drill. After the production of Pokémon Diamond/Pearl, it is revealed that the male Rhydon has a longer drill horn than the female.
Rhydon`s brain is considerably more developed than that of its pre-evolved form Rhyhorn, which allows it to exhibit some signs of advanced intelligence, including the ability to stand upright and walk on two legs. It is capable of living in molten lava under the ground.
Rhydon is notable for being one of the very few non-water rock type Pokémon to learn the move surf.</description>

If a vine is lost or damaged it will grow back the next day. The vines always jiggle, which easily unnerves its foes.</description>

<description>"Gold-" refers to the fact that it resembles a goldfish. The "-een" is most likely "queen," but it is possible that it is a simple feminine suffix (misspelling of "-ine"). The Japanese name plays on tosakin (土佐金), which is a kind of goldfish. In the original Beta version, it was known as Goldy. Goldeen evolves into Seaking at lvl33.It is considered to be one of the most beautiful Pokémon in the world. Its sharp horn can do serious damage, but it can`t fight on land.
Misty owns a Goldeen that is not really used for battles, but to look for things underwater.</description>

<description>Seaking is a goldfish Pokemon. The "sea" in Seaking`s name refers to the fact that it is a water-inhabiting Pokemon. "King" is probably a reference to its unevolved form`s name, Goldeen (a portmanteau of "gold" and "queen"). Hence, its name means "king of the sea." Its Japanese name refers to Azumanishiki (東錦) for one kind of "goldfish" and Ou (王) for "king". Seaking was originally called Neptune in the beta. Seaking is a goldfish Pokemon with a sharp horn, much like a narwhal. It uses the horn for boring holes in a rock for its nest. In spawning season, they can be seen swimming up rivers and streams.</description>

<description>Starmie is an aquatic starfish Pokémon that evolves from Staryu through use of a Water Stone. It moves through the water by spinning its star-shaped body in a manner like that of a propeller. It consists of two five-point, purple star-shaped structures superimposed on top of each other. At its center is a large gem, surrounded by a golden crest like structure. Starmie`s center section - the gem - is known as its "core". This gem is considered very valuable among collectors. The gem`s hue can change to any color in the visual spectrum, earning Starmie the nickname "the gem of the sea". When Starmie is weak, the core grows dim and starts flickering whilst producing distinctive warning sounds.
In the Pokémon world, the aforementioned peculiar properties of Starmie`s anatomy leads some people to theorize that Starmie`s origins are not of this planet, and that its luminescent core is used to send electromagnetic signals into outer space. It may have some connection with Deoxys having a similar core and the ability to regenerate. In ancient times, Starmie was attributed an equally mystical origin: that it was created from the reflection of the stars upon the waves at night.
In the anime, Starmie is one of the Pokémon used in Misty`s team during the most of the Kanto arc, along with its pre-evolved form, Staryu. Misty also often used Starmie outside of battle for transportation through water or for fire-fighting purposes. Misty eventually left Starmie in the care of her sisters at the Cerulean City Gym, and later reobtained it upon her return.</description>

<description>Mr. Mime is a dual-type Psychic/Fairy Pokémon introduced in Generation I. Prior to Generation VI, it was a pure Psychic-type Pokémon.
It evolves from Mime Jr. when leveled up while knowing Mimic.
In Galar, Mr. Mime has an Ice/Psychic-type regional form. It evolves into Mr. Rime starting at level 42. All Mime Jr. in Galar evolve into this form regardless of their origin.
Mr. Mime is a bipedal, humanoid Pokémon. Blue growths resembling clown hair extend from the sides of its pale pink head, and there is a magenta circle on each cheek. Its jaw is curved inward, resembling the mouth of a wooden dummy. It has a round, white body with a magenta spot in the middle, light pink arms and legs that connect to its body via magenta spheres, and small white coverings over its knees. Its white hands resemble gloves with magenta pads on the tips of its white fingers and its dark blue feet curl upward at the tips.
From birth, this Pokémon is an excellent pantomime. As it matures, it gains the ability to solidify air molecules by vibrating its fingertips. This ability allows it to create invisible objects with its gestures. It punishes those who interrupt its act or are not impressed by slapping them. Mr. Mime is usually very rare, but can be found in suburban areas. In the past, Substitute was its signature move.
Galarian Mr. Mime are mostly blue and white. Much like other Mr. Mime they also have blue growths resembling clown hair, however, these also extend and cover its cheeks. They have wider-shaped eyes then other Mr. Mime and they have a blue nose. Their bodies have a white top and a blue bottom and they have a diamond made of ice that resembles a tie. They have blue shoulder spheres, but lack these spheres on their legs. Unlike other Mr. Mime, Galarian Mr. Mime do not have defined fingers and instead have mitten-like hands. Their feet are more defined, resembling blue shoes with light blue soles, presumably made out of ice. Rather than miming, Galarian Mr. Mime`s main talent is tap dancing. Their feet radiate chilliness and can be used to create a floor of ice, which they can kick up to act as a barrier.</description>

<description>Scyther is a mantis Pokémon. Its English name was originally going to be Stryke, as revealed in the 1999 Nintendo Official Magazine Pokémon Special #2. Scyther`s most impressive feature is its scythe-like arms that can easily cut through metal. Scyther is also noted for its agility. While hunting in the wild or in a battle between trainers, it relies on its speed to strike quickly and to avoid being struck in return by its foe. Its high-supernatural speed can make it seem to be in more than one place at once, or to seem invisible as it moves in, strikes, and leaves the opponent before he can feel the blow. Scyther`s wings are capable of flight, but this is rare; it is not a fast or an agile flier, and it is a better hunter on its own feet.
In the anime, Tracey Sketchit catches a Scyther in the Orange Islands. It is aged and was recently removed from its clan by a younger, stronger Scyther. The bug Pokémon reconcile their differences through the interference of Team Rocket, and Tracey`s Scyther is allowed to leave with him with its conflicts fully resolved. Tracey`s Scyther is incredibly strong-willed, preferring to keep watch over the travellers while they sleep, as opposed to staying in its Poké Ball.
In the episode "Showdown at Dark City", two gangs were fighting in a dusty town. The leader of one team had an Electabuzz while the other had a Scyther. When Ash poured ketchup barrels on both Pokémon, they locked into each other in a death grip, meaning that Scyther and Electabuzz are possibly provoked by the color red.</description>

<description>Jynx is a humanoid Pokémon. Jynx walks in a dance-like fashion, wiggling its hips in a seductive manner. Its bouncing motions are alluring enough so that any person seeing it feels compelled to copy the motion. Jynx is known for its smooching habit, which it actually uses as a battling tool. A Jynx usually gives a sleep or confusion-inducing kiss to its opponents, using its signature attack, "Lovely Kiss." Jynx vocalizes a mysterious language, similar to that of humans, understood only by other Jynx, and no human or other Pokémon is able to understand it.
In 2000, children`s book author Carole Boston Weatherford published an article complaining that Jynx`s original design bore a striking resemblance to blackface actors, an image from America`s past that is now considered racist. An episode of Pokemon portrayed this, The Ice Cave. She has described the Pokémon as "a dead ringer for an obese drag queen," In response to this controversy, in 2000 Nintendo changed Jynx`s face from black to purple and its hands from blue to purple in localized versions, a change which would be reflected several years later in the Japanese versions of the games and the Advanced Generation anime series. The newly-redesigned Jynx has white arms instead of red arms.</description>

<description>Since Electabuzz is electric, he feeds on electrical currents. Its methods of securing its food vary: during thunderstorms, an Electabuzz climbs to the highest place possible, in hopes that it will be struck by lightning. As a result, many towns in the Pokémon world employ an Electabuzz in lieu of a lightning rod. Electabuzz also lurk around power plants, feeding off the electricity generated there. This behavior is dangerous to the public, as occasionally blackouts are caused by an Electabuzz overindulging itself at a power plant, or worse, walking down to a city and drawing electricity from there.
Due to its unique diet, Electabuzz`s body is constantly discharging stored electricity, to the point that it glows whitish blue in darkness and static electricity effects manifest. An Electabuzz can control the electric current coursing in its body to communicate with other Electric-type Pokémon, especially with another Electabuzz. It originally is lone in its evolutionary line, but it gains a previous form, Elekid, in Pokémon Gold and Silver, and an evolution, Electivire, in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.
Like Scyther, as seen in the anime, Electabuzz is most likely provoked by the color red.</description>

<description>Magmar is born in the proximity of an active volcano, and if possible it spends its entire life there, or at least in a place hot enough to sustain its body temperature of 3,300 degrees Fahrenheit. If a Magmar finds itself in a cold place, it will try to make it more habitable by blowing scorching flames around. It has the ability to expel orange-colored fire from every part of its body, including its mouth. This serves both offensive and defensive purposes: a Magmar cloaked in flames resembles a big ball of fire. Together with its matching body coloration, Magmar can quite easily hide itself among flames, escaping detection. If Magmar is actually wounded, it can heal itself by dipping its wound(s) in lava. When it emerges, damp soil clings onto its body. In Gold and Silver, Magmar gets a pre-evolution, Magby, and in Diamond and Pearl, an evolution, Magmortar.
Magmar has appeared in the anime owned by various people but the ones of note are the Gym Leader Blaine, Ash`s now ex-rival, Gary Oak, and his new rival, Paul. Paul had been looking for a new fire Pokémon since the release of Chimchar in "Glory Blaze" and captured Magmar sometime between capturing Gliscor in ""Gliscor and Gligar: Getting Through the Wind Maze" and his Gym Battle, with Maylene which was shown as a flashback in "Lucario and the Aura Sphere of Rage."</description>

<description>Tauros is a bull known for its violent urges and rowdy, aggressive disposition in general, as supplied by a tremendous amount of natural stamina. Any given Tauros finds it impossible to keep up its spirits in life without near-constant rampaging. It always tries to find opponent Pokémon to battle outright to serve this purpose, but if it is alone, it will instead concentrate on charging at and knocking down thick trees to calm itself. By locking horns with other Tauros, it fights to assert dominance in a herd. The protector of the herd is usually noted by battle torn horns. As Tauros is based on a bull, it is a male-only Pokémon; its female equivalent is the more cowlike Miltank.
Tauros has a special habit that specifically affects its ability to battle, both in the wild and in trainer-directed Pokémon battles: It whips itself with its three long snapping tails. When it targets an enemy, it heightens its will to battle by whipping its own backside with its tails before charging at full speed.
In the anime, Ash Ketchum captures a herd of thirty Tauros in the Safari Zone (though the episode which features this was banned in America due to its flagrant gun use and politically incorrect humor). They usually remain in Professor Oak`s fields, Ash occasionally picks one up for various tournaments or important battles.</description>

<description>Magikarp is a commonly found Pokémon that can survive in rivers, lakes,and oceans. Despite its adaptability, the Pokédex states that the Magikarp species has grown weaker over time, and it is one of the least viable for battling in the series. It eventually evolves into another, far more powerful Pokémon, Gyarados.
Magikarp is commonly thought of as the weakest Pokémon. They are only able to learn three moves: Splash (does absolutely nothing), Tackle (a weak attack), and Flail (which does more damage as Magikarp is more damaged.)
In the anime, Magikarp has appeared several times, most notably as the subject of a running gag in which a salesman attempts to trick Team Rocket into buying Magikarp in various guises. (This man also appears in Pokémon Red, Blue, Yellow, FireRed, and LeafGreen.) Team Rocket later adopted a Magikarp-shaped submarine.
Magikarp also appear many times in the video games. They can be found in almost any pond, river, lake, or sea. Many trainers have them, along with other weak Water Pokémon like Goldeen or Horsea. In Pokémon Pearl, one trainer named "Ander," found outside Lake Valor, possesses a Magikarp whose move "Quake" replaces the normal Magikarp`s equally useless "Splash".</description>

<name>Gyarados</name>
<gender>dimorphic</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Gyarados is the evolved form of Magikarp. It is a dramatically large change from Magikarp, going from a small fish to a long draconic, serpentine body. Gyarados tend to be very aggressive, and are powerful enough to destroy entire cities. They have a reputation for appearing where there is conflict, and shrivelling everything up with the Hyper Beam attack. Rampages like this have been known to last upwards of an entire month, and will not end until everything around them has been destroyed. Because they have been known to sink ships as well through the seastorms their rage causes, they are considered legendary among sailors, especially the red/ golden variety. Its big change in behavior is said to be attributed to a structural change occurring in its brain while evolving from Magikarp.
In the beta version of Pokémon Red and Green, Gyarados had the name of Skullkraken.
Shiny Gyarados is a particularly rare variety of Gyarados. While Gyarados are normally blue in color, there are some rare red/ gold scaled Gyarados. Though no more powerful than their more common blue counterparts, red Gyarados are valued for their rarity and individuality. This is caused in Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal and the anime by a radio frequency transmitted by Team Rocket to force the Magikarp to evolve. The red coloration comes from the Magikarp evolving prematurely, and not undergoing the conversion from red to blue scale pigment. Thus, they retain the same color they had as a Magikarp. Red Gyarados are more commonly called Shiny Gyarados, or even Golden Gyarados due to the contrasting coloration.
In Generation II Pokémon games, a red Gyarados at the Lake of Rage is a main part of the plot. After its defeat or capture, a Red Scale is obtained, which can be given to Mr. Pokémon, or Marcus Spanier, in exchange for an Exp. Share. The red Gyarados is the only Pokémon in the Generation II games that will be shiny without fail.
In the anime, one is owned by Misty. At first, she fearfully dislikes Gyarados due to a traumatic experience, but manages to get over the fear, take over the Cerulean City Gym, and add one to her team. The red Gyarados in the anime is caught by Lance, the dragon trainer, to rescue it from Team Rocket. Team Rocket also uses a Gyarados-shaped submarine in early episodes, but trades it for a Magikarp-shaped submarine in later episodes.
Gyarados was noticeably larger in the Indigo Series, but has since become a lot smaller. Gyarados` most powerful attack is said to be Dragon Rage (however, this is not true in the games, given that Dragon Rage only ever does 40 damage), where many other Gyarados appear around the main Gyarados, then they start spinning around at such a speed they became one huge tornado, as seen in Episode #18: Island of The Giant Pokémon.</description>

<description>Lapras is a dual-type Water/Ice Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, it has a Gigantamax form.
Lapras is a large sea Pokémon that resembles a plesiosaur. It has a blue hide with darker blue spots and a cream-colored underside. It has large brown eyes, a short horn on its forehead, and tightly curled ears. It has a long neck and four flippers. The foremost flippers are larger than the hind. On its back is a heavy, gray shell covered in blunt knobs.
Lapras is a gentle, helpful Pokémon that enjoys ferrying people across bodies of water. In the past, its docility made it an easy target for hunters, and it was driven to near-extinction. Recent protection efforts have seen Lapras become overabundant instead, which is now affecting the fish Pokémon numbers in some areas. An intelligent Pokémon, it is able to understand human speech. Lapras have been known to travel in large pods across the seas, spanning both polar and tropical areas. To keep in touch with other of its kind, it sings enchanting melodies. In the anime it was shown that Lapras is able to develop psychic abilities such as telepathy.
As Gigantamax Lapras, it becomes larger in size and more armored. Its shell resembles a cruise ship with four gray and red stripes surrounding it, and it has four spikes on top of its shell with one steel spike resembling a funnel, which has three red clouds surrounding it. The sclera in Lapras` eyes change colors to white, yellow, and blue. A light blue ring of fine thin lines resembling a musical sheet created from ice particles circles around its shell.
5,000 people can ride on the shell of Gigantamax Lapras for a very comfortable ride without any issues. Lapras can use it giant ring to break any icebergs that may prevent it from swimming.
Gigantamax Lapras is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Resonance.</description>

<description>Ditto has the form of an amorphous blob with a simplistic face. Ditto is purple and is able to rearrange its cellular structure into anything at will, but it usually changes into another Pokémon nearby. It takes on the exact form of the Pokémon and can use all of its abilities. The only things that can make it change back are being defeated and the Ditto laughing. During the night, it transforms into a rock to avoid being attacked. If it tries to transform from memory, or if it is inexperienced, it will likely mess up on certain details such as leaving its own face or staying its own size. The only other Pokémon capable of transforming is the legendary Pokémon Mew.
In the games, with the exception of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, it takes on the type and attacks of its opponent, but each attack has 5 PP. However in a battle between two dittos when it transforms its pp is reset to 5. Being its only move this forms an continual loop. It can also breed with any Pokémon that is capable of breeding, including genderless Pokémon such as Staryu or Porygon. In the anime, two Ditto are owned by Duplica, a girl who can easily imitate people. The first Ditto is used to help her run a theater. At first it cannot correctly transform its face, but with the help of Team Rocket, it overcomes that barrier. The second Ditto, "Mini-Dit", cannot change its size at all.
In Mystery Dungeon Red and Blue Rescue Team, when Ditto transforms it cannot copy any of the transformed Pokémon moves. Therefore it has only 2 attack choices -- use the attack unique to Mystery Dungeon, or use Struggle.</description>

<description>Eevee is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves into one of eight different Pokémon through various methods. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Eevee is the game mascot and starter Pokémon in Pokémon: Let`s Go, Eevee!, as well as for the main characters of Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness and Pokémon Conquest. It is also the rival`s starter Pokémon in Pokémon Yellow, although Professor Oak originally intended to give it to the player.
Eevee is a mammalian, quadruped Pokémon with primarily brown fur. The tip of its bushy tail and its large furry collar are cream-colored. It has short, slender legs with three small toes and a pink paw pad on each foot. Eevee has brown eyes, long pointed ears with dark brown interiors, and a small black nose. Eevee is rarely found in the wild and is mostly only found in cities and towns. However, Eevee is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure that is easily influenced by its environment. This allows it to adapt to a variety of habitats by evolving. Eevee is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Extreme Evoboost.
In Pokémon: Let`s Go, Eevee!, the player starts with a special Eevee known as a Partner Eevee. The Partner Eevee has purple eyes and a lighter shade of fur. These design elements likely taken from the anime, which implemented similar traits starting in the Advanced Generation series. The marking on the tip of a female Partner Eevee is heart-shaped. Before Pokémon Sword and Shield, this trait was unique and wasn`t found on other female Eevee. Partner Eevee has higher base stats and access to moves that normal Eevee do not. Partner Eevee is the only Pokémon capable of performing Bouncy Bubble, Buzzy Buzz, Sizzly Slide, Glitzy Glow, Baddy Bad, Sappy Seed, Freezy Frost, Sparkly Swirl, and the Partner Power, Veevee Volley. In Pokémon Sword and Shield, the unique pattern is present on all female Eevee as a true gender difference.
As Gigantamax Eevee, it has become larger and more fluffy. The fur collar becomes longer with several triangular furs pointing straight up. The right ear has three red clouds surrounding it like a circle. Due to the fur becoming fluffier and luxurious, any enemies caught in it will lose the will to fight due to being enamored by its presence. Due to Gigantamaxing, Eevee becomes even more playful and rambunctious, desiring to play with its opponent and often unintentionally crushing them with its size.
Gigantamax Eevee is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Cuddle.</description>

<description>Vaporeon is one of the evolutions of Eevee that is caused by radiation from a water stone. Upon evolving, it gains fins and gills that give it the ability to live underwater. It has small scales that are hard to see. Its finned tail is similar to a mermaid`s, so it is often mistaken for one. Vaporeon`s cells are similar in structure to water molecules, and this allows it to have a unique control over the water around it. This includes being able to transform itself into liquid as a form of camouflage (this being portrayed in the games as its ability to learn the attack Acid Armor), and detect rain through subtle vibrations in its fins. Its base scale color is aqua with darker aqua that makes a line along the spine from the tail to the neck where it forms into a base for its white frill. A darker-aqua patch on the head is similar in shape to a diving cap, and upon the head are three yellow fins, two resembling ears, and the middle one, a Dorsal fin. Its ability is `Water Absorb`, which allows it to gain HP when struck with a water type move.</description>

<description>Jolteon is one of the evolutions of Eevee that is caused by radiation from a thunder stone. Jolteon is covered with spiky, bright yellow fur, with white spiky fur surrounding its neck. Its fur sparks with electricity constantly; it can be soft to the touch or turn into sharp needles that can be fired when it is angered. Jolteon is able to gather negative ions from the atmosphere, using the resulting electricity to create lightning bolts of up to 10,000 volts. Its individual cells also create small electrical charges on their own, which combined with the static electricity caused by its body can result in powerful electric-type attacks. It`s very sensitive which causes it to constantly charge as it quickly changes moods. It can also make lightning and cause small thunderstorms. In the Pokémon video games, Jolteon can absorb electric attacks and turn them into HP (Health Point, or Health) with the ability `Volt Absorb`.</description>

<description>Flareon is one of the evolutions of Eevee that is caused by exposure to a Fire Stone. It has a red body and thick, yellow fur on its face, head, neck, and tail. Its ears are as long as the Jolteon`s. It stores thermal energy from the sun, causing its body temperature to skyrocket to more than a range of 1600 degrees Celsius, releasing its flames from an internal sack. Its ability is `Flash Fire` which negates fire-type moves against it and increases its attack by 1.5 times damage if hit by a damaging fire attack.</description>

<gender>none/does not apply</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Porygon is the first man-made Pokemon, the product of extensive research by Silph Co. It consists entirely of programming code, allowing it to convert itself entirely back to program data. This allows it to move freely in cyberspace. This code is copy protected in order to prevent duplication. This code is fairly restrictive, limiting Porygon to certain pre-programmed motions, actions, and reactions. As it does not need to breathe, it is used in various environments, even some normally considered inhospitable.
In the Pokemon world, Porygon is only available as a prize from slot machines. As a result, a large number of people have taken to playing the slots seeking to win a Porygon. These gamblers are especially visible in the towns of Kanto and Johto. Porygon are not available in Hoenn at all. However, Porygon actually run wild in Sinnoh. Porygon is cheaper to obtain in some Pokémon versions than in others.
Porygon`s most significant appearance in the Pokemon Anime to date is Dennou Senshi Porygon, an episode notorious for having caused hundreds of children to have epileptic seizures during its broadcast in Japan. Even though Pikachu caused the `seizure attack`, it was Porygon (and its evolved forms) who were banned from the Pokemon anime. Aside from that, Porygon has had only a few minor cameo appearances.</description>

<description>Omanyte is a prehistoric Pokémon that is long extinct. Some can be revived using helix fossils, and a small number have been shown to be in deep hibernation. It lives in the deep in the primordial sea where it navigates by twisting its ten tentacles, and uses air in its shell to rise and sink. It eats plankton off of the sea floor, and withdraws into its shell to escape harm. Omanyte is based on the ammonite a creature which resembles it, and sounds similar in name.</description>

<description>Omastar is the evolution of Omanyte. Omastar went extinct due to its heavy shell making it too sluggish to capture prey despite the fact that its ability is "swift swim". When it does capture prey, it uses its tentacles, which developed similarly to hands and feet, to hold its prey, and tear at it with its fangs within the mouth. If met with mollusks, such as Shellder, it cracks the shell and sucks out the insides. Its appearance seems to be based on the ammonite, an extinct cephalapod that resembles a Chambered Nautilus.</description>

While concealed, Kabuto leaves exposed only its hard shell, which protects it from any attacks, while the glowing eyes on its back allow it to continue monitoring its surroundings. If it is flipped upside down, it becomes helpless and defenseless as it is unable to flip over on its own. According to the anime, oil extracted from a Kabuto is rumored to have interesting medical properties, longevity being one of them.</description>

<description>Kabutops is the evolved form of Kabuto. It lives in the water, and can move at high speeds by folding its limbs against its body. The creature comes out of the water to hunt. Kabutops is a predator, but its nature of feeding is vampiric; instead of killing its prey, it uses its razor sharp claws to open wounds in its prey, and then drink its blood. It attempts to avoid killing prey, so it may feed at a later date. Kabutops is loosely based on trilobites as a counterpoint to Omanyte and Omastar representing ammonites. This can clearly be seen with the enlarged cephalon and the pygidium and thoracic spines. It was introduced in Pokémon Red and Blue, where the player-character plays a part in reviving the assumed-extinct species by giving a Fossil to the Scientist on Cinnabar Island.</description>

It is imagined to have been the king of the skies in ancient times, with a body structure similar to a pterodactyl and other features, such as the head and tail, having more in common with dragons. It captures its prey with its talons and brings it to its nest. However, if the prey resists, it may use its razor-sharp teeth to immobilize it. When attacking its enemies or opponents, it goes for the throat with its saw like fangs. Aerodactyl is heavy and rough-skinned, leading to the development of strong wings.</description>

<description>Snorlax is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Munchlax when leveled up with high friendship. It also has a Gigantamax form.
In the Generation I and II games and their remakes, wild Snorlax can be found sleeping in inconvenient locations throughout Kanto. In order to catch one, a Trainer must first awaken it with music from either a Poké Flute or Pokégear set to the Poké Flute channel. A sleeping Snorlax makes a return in Pokémon X and Y, in which it is blocking the player`s way on Route 7.
Snorlax is a huge, bipedal, dark blue-green Pokémon with a cream-colored face, belly, and feet. Its body is composed of mostly its belly, as its limbs are comparatively small. Its head is large with small, pointed ears and two pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw. It has round feet, which both have three claws and a circular brown paw pad, and short arms with five claws on each hand. Snorlax`s bulk makes it the heaviest Normal type.
Snorlax is often found in mountains and forests. It wakes up only to eat, requiring 900 lbs. (400 kg) of food per day before returning to its slumber. It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it to eat even moldy food without feeling any ill effects. It can even handle thorny plants or Muk`s poison. It can also eat while it is resting. Snorlax is docile enough to let children and small Pokémon bounce on its large stomach.
Snorlax can show awesome power when prompted. As Gigantamax Snorlax, seeds and small rocks that were tangled in its belly fur goes through immense growth and a tree spouts upon its belly. The tree has three red clouds surrounding it like a circle. It almost never moves; even when in battle it only slightly lifts its body and attacks by flailing with its arms and legs. However, its attacks are very powerful — Gigantamax Snorlax is considered to be the strongest Dynamax Pokémon to have been discovered.
It is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Pulverizing Pancake and G-Max Move G-Max Replenish.</description>

<description>Articuno is one of the three Legendary Birds along with Zapdos and Moltres. It is a large bird with blue plumage, a bluish-white-feathered chest, a three feathered crest adorning its nose, and a long, sparkling tail. It can create and manipulate ice freely. Its translucent wings are imbued with the essence of frigidity, and the flapping of its wings chills the air, causing the conversion of water particles in the air into snow or ice, causing snow to fall when it flies overhead. In legend, Articuno resides within the confines of icy mountains, because those who have seen its were often doomed explorers scaling such mountains, and therefore it is believed Articuno makes it a point to appear before them and save them.
It is interesting to note that the last letters of its name, "uno" ("one" in Spanish), suggest it is the first of the three legendary bird Pokémon. This is reinforced by the fact that the last letters of the names of its fellow legendary birds suggest that they are the second and third. They are Zapdos ("dos", which is "two" in Spanish) and Moltres ("tres", which is "three" in Spanish).
Articuno`s video game appearances occur in the very confusing mazes of the icy Seafoam Islands, on Route 20, between Fuschia City and Cinnabar Island. It is a unique Pokémon that usually appears alongside Zapdos and Moltres. Since only one of each exists in the games, players usually try to catch the Birds.
Articuno also makes appearances in the anime and manga, also as a unique Pokémon and a general species. They participate in various events and battles. Articuno was initially believed to be the large golden bird Ash saw in the very first episode, but it turned out to actually be Ho-Oh, though the earlier reference was kept in the Red, Blue, Yellow game versions when one looked into a telescope and saw it. Its largest role is in Pokémon: The Movie 2000. Lawrence III creates a battle between the three birds, and Ash Ketchum had to team up with Lugia to stop them. In the beginning of the Battle Frontier challenge in the anime, Noland, the battle factory frontier brain had befriended one. After reuniting with their photographer friend Todd, Ash and its friends hear a rumor that Articuno lives on a certain mountain. After several encounters with Team Rocket, Ash and Todd are saved by Articuno from a snowstorm, and Todd manages to snap a picture of it. Ash`s Charizard did battle with it and Articuno lost by a narrow margin.
In Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, Articuno is the third legendary boss as well as the third legendary bird you battle. He is also the hardest to convince of the three legendary birds that the main hero Pokémon is not responsible for the havocs in the Pokémon World. Absol prevents Articuno from ending the hero and partner by ensuring that Articuno knows the truth.</description>

<description>Zapdos is one of the three Legendary Birds along with Articuno and Moltres. It may be based on the thunderbird. It is a bird with a yellow, angular body and wings. Also behind its main yellow wings is a second pair of thinner, jet-black wings. Its beak is long and extremely sharp. Zapdos, a creature that can freely manipulate electricity, is thought to live in thunderclouds, where it apparently only gains power when struck by lightning. It is seen emerging from clouds while dropping enormous lightning bolts, and even if it does not launch electricity its wings make peculiar crackling and snapping sounds as it flies.
It is interesting to note that the last letters of its name, "dos" ("two" in Spanish), suggest it is the second of the three legendary bird Pokémon. This is reinforced by the fact that the last letters of the names of its fellow legendary birds suggest that they are the first and third. They are Articuno ("uno", which is "one" in Spanish) and Moltres ("tres", which is "three" in Spanish).
Zapdos is found in a Power Plant off the coast of the Rock Tunnel near Cerulean City in Pokémon Red and Blue, and related games. It also plays small roles in the anime and manga. Zapdos is featured in Pokémon The Movie 2000 together with the other two Legendary birds, Articuno and Moltres. It appears that Zapdos communicates through electricity as it shocks Pikachu to communicate. Zapdos also appeared in the 9th Pokémon Movie.</description>

<description>Moltres is one of the three Legendary Birds, along with Articuno and Zapdos. It is a large bird that is literally ablaze with fire, resembling something related to a phoenix. It has an orange body, a small pointed beak, and where its plumage should be are flames of a searing intensity. It can freely create and manipulate fire, and it constantly looses flaming embers from its wings. When its body is injured for any reason, it will head towards a volcano and dip its body in the molten magma to heal its wounds. Moltres is an elusive creature, seen about as rarely as the other two members of the Legendary Bird triad. When Moltres thinks it is in the least bit possible danger, it will summon a flash of fire and seemingly disappear, flying out of sight very fast.
The first video game appearance of Moltres was in Pokémon Red and Blue versions. In these Versions, Moltres was in a blocked off area of Victory Road, only accessible from the end of the cave. However, Moltres was moved from its lair in FireRed and LeafGreen, to Mount Ember, an active volcano, on 1 Island, the first of the new Sevii Islands.
The first official appearance of Moltres in the anime was in the episode that marks the beginning of the Pokémon League, where it lights the torch which is equivalent to the real-life Olympic Torch. It also plays a role in "Pokémon The Movie 2000: The Power of One", along with the other two Legendary Birds (Zapdos and Articuno). It was one of the two birds that the villainous collector, often referred to as both Gelardan and Lawrence III, captured to allow him access to Lugia`s power, but the upset of the balance that occurred as a result nearly caused a worldwide weather catastrophe as Moltres was driven to wage war with its two rivals. They were quelled once Ash and Lugia fulfilled the prophecy related to the legendary birds. In a later episode of Pokémon Chronicles, Ash`s rival Richie encountered a trainer named Silver who wanted to capture Moltres, battling him with its Salamence. Silver is interrupted by Team Rocket members Butch and Cassidy who attempt to kidnap Moltres, rather than catching him fairly. Richie and Silver team up to defeat Butch and Cassidy and rescue Moltres, although the firebird was badly weakened by the Rockets` attack. Silver let Moltres go, wanting to catch him in a fair fight when it was at full strength, although it promised it`d try again.
According to one of the trainers in Blaine`s gym on Cinnabar Island, Blaine decided to become a trainer of Fire-type Pokémon after having been rescued by a fiery bird when lost in the mountains.</description>

<description>Dratini is a serpent-like dragon Pokémon with a white circle shape on its forehead. It has two developing wings at the sides of its head, which grow to be enormous as it evolves. Dratini are born small, and as they shed their skin, they grow larger. They have a massive amount of energy rapidly increasing inside of their bodies, hence, they have great strength which grows exponentially as they evolve. They were thought to be purely mythical creatures, but they were discovered to be real by a fisherman. They live in colonies in the ocean in limited numbers and fetch a high price as Pokémon to be used for battling. They can only be obtained by the most determined and skilled trainers, as demonstrated on various episodes of the original Pokémon series.
The episode in which Dratini first appeared ("The Legend of Dratini") has never been seen on American television, due to use of guns and humor considered "politically incorrect" to American audiences (Meowth dressed as Adolf Hitler, Jessie seducing a guard by dressing up as a schoolgirl).</description>

<description>Dragonair is the evolved form of Dratini. They look like desert serpents with a long, noticeable, light-blue and white body. They have a small horn on the forehead and two wing-shaped protuberances on the sides of the head which are often said to be ears, but are in fact wings, as evidenced in the short film preceding Pokémon: The Movie 2000. They have a blue orb placed at the neck and another two near the tip of the tail. Dragonair can discharge energy through the orbs to envelop itself in a gentle aura. This aura, which makes its body shine slightly and gives it a mystical appearance, is said to enable the Dragonair to control the weather in the immediate area and change it in a matter of minutes.
Dragonair live in large bodies of water such as the lakes or the sea. They store an enormous amount of energy inside their bodies, and seems to manifest itself in two distinct fashions. Even though they lack large wings, Dragonair have been seen flying with the wings on the side of the head greatly enlarged.</description>

<description>Dragonite is the final form of the Dratini evolutionary line. It evolves from Dragonair at level 55. Dragonite`s appearance is notably different from that of its previous forms. As Dragonite, it is now a golden bipedal dragon with a beige underbelly that extends from the top of its neck to the tip of its tail. Along with already being a Dragon-type, it has now gained the secondary Flying-type, growing wings. Dragonite is one of the fastest flying Pokémon, and "The fastest flying Pokémon" as of the first generation. It has a small horn on the top of its head, along with slightly "S" shaped antennae. However, much like its previous forms, Dragonite still has a gentle and somewhat innocent appearance. Its diet consists mainly of berries, soft plants, and fruit, while it will occasionally eat crustaceans, like Corphish and Krabby.
Dragonite are very loyal to any trainer they find worthy of acceptance. They are calm, gentle, and intelligent creatures, but when threatened can put their pudgy bulk to good use. Dragonite seem to have more advanced vocal abilities compared to other Pokémon in that they make several different types of calls, rather than just saying their name. They have been noted to save drowning swimmers and threatened sailors. Dragonites` speed is very varied; some Dragonite can have great speeds while other have very low/average speeds. It is said that Dragonite can circle the globe in less than 16 hours.
Dragonite`s main anime appearance was at the end of the Orange Island League season in "Enter The Dragonite". It was spotted twice in the previous episode "Hello Pummelo" as Ash, Tracy and Misty saw it flying over the sea around Pummelo Island and they learned that it was owned by the "Orange Crew" leader, Drake. It also defeated Team Rocket as they tried to steal Dragonite. In Ash`s six on six battle with Drake, it defeated Ash`s Charizard with Dragon Rage, Squirtle with Thunder and Tauros with Thunder before Ash`s Pikachu took it out with a Thunder of its own. While none of Ash`s Pokémon were strong enough to defeat Dragonite on their own, their combined attacks steadily weakened it to the point of exhaustion, allowing Pikachu to finally defeat it. Drake keeps Dragonite`s Poké Ball on a necklace. Professor Oak also owns a Dragonite and was used prior to the episode "The Mastermind of Mirage Pokémon". It also appeared in Pokémon: The First Movie, when it was sent by Mewtwo to give Ash and his friends an invitation. It also appeared in the beginning of Ash`s journey when he encountered Bill. Here, Dragonite was described as an unknown legendary Pokémon by the Pokédex, and because it was nighttime the colour of its skin couldn`t be seen.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Mewtwo, known as the "Genetic" species of Pokémon, is a Pokémon cloned from Mew that exists quietly in an undiscovered cave. It was created by scientists through genetic manipulation of Mew`s DNA involving repeated recombination, gene splicing, and other DNA experiments over many years. While its DNA is mostly similar to the original Mew DNA, Mewtwo is very different in both its body size and personality. Its creators did not imbue him with compassion, making it one of the most savage Pokémon, able to strike fear into its enemies with its cold, glowing eyes. Being made for battle, its combat abilities and psychic powers were developed to be of the highest level, and it always thinks of defeating its opponents. In order to always fight at full power, it remains motionless to conserve energy.
In the events of the Pokémon: The First Movie, Mewtwo awakens, destroys the laboratory where it is created and being kept, and works under Giovanni, who had originally ordered Mewtwo`s creation, until realizing it is just being used. After escaping, it tries to destroy the humans that `enslave` Pokémon and start a new world. During Pokémon: Mewtwo Returns, it seeks complete solitude and chooses to live without fighting. Giovanni tries to recapture Mewtwo, but it is ultimately saved by Ash. Mewtwo chooses not to confine himself to the world and roams the earth. In the "Mastermind of the Mirage Pokémon" a mirage copy of Mewtwo is seen furiously battling Ash and its friends.</description>

<description>Chikorita is the Grass-type Starter Pokémon in Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal. One may also get this Pokémon in Pokémon Emerald by completing the Hoenn Dex (not including Jirachi and Deoxys). It is reptilian in appearance, but it has a large leaf sprouting from its head, a collar of crystalline seeds around its neck, and a short tail. Chikorita, by nature, are docile Pokémon that love to soak up the sun`s rays. The leaf serves multiple purposes; in its natural environment, its leaf detects the density of humidity and temperature in the atmosphere to help it seek warm places. The pleasant aroma that wafts from the leaf can be used by Chikorita in battle by waving it around to becalm the foe and keep it at bay. In the Pokémon anime, Ash Ketchum caught a Chikorita early on its adventure through Johto, after saving it from a sudden snowstorm. Chikorita is very affectionate, stubborn, and powerful, often sees Pikachu as a rival for Ash`s affections, and apparently has a crush on Ash. In the episode "Current Events", Chikorita evolves into a Bayleef when Ash was almost in mortal peril.</description>

<description>Cyndaquil is the Fire-type Starter Pokémon in Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal. In Pokémon Emerald you may get Cyndaquil after completing the Hoenn Dex. Cyndaquil are covered with a flame-resistant, dull-yellow fur with a rich streak of blue running from the tip of its snout over its head and spreading out to cover the majority of its back. There are also four spots of red fur on the back. When Cyndaquil is frightened or angry, it can focus its internal energy to produce blazing "spines" of flame from the spots. While it is a quadruped, Cyndaquil is more than capable of maneuvering on two legs. They are based on an echidna.
Cyndaquil are generally timid and not naturally aggressive, and are often seen curled into a ball for protection. This action leaves its back and special flame-emitting vent fur exposed. When predators and enemies stalk too close, Cyndaquil unleashes a furious flame from the vents as a deterrent. If provoked further, Cyndaquil will intensify its flames, creating a smokescreen that will buy it some time to escape.
Cyndaquil has made numerous appearances in the Pokémon anime, mostly under the control of Ash. His Cyndaquil often seemed to be very shy and relaxed, often sleeping. At first, it needed time to warm up and use flamethrower, but with some training from Ash, it is now able to use its flamethrower whenever it wants. It also possesses prodigious dodging capabilities, able to wear opponents down by simply evading long series of attacks over an extended period of time. Cyndaquil is currently at Professor Oak`s lab since Ash decided to make a fresh start when going to Hoenn, and therefore, left all of its Pokémon, except Pikachu, with Professor Oak.</description>

<description>Quilava is the evolution of Cyndaquil. Quilava have long, thin bodies with small forepaws and slightly longer hindpaws, similar to real-life weasels. Their tan fur is slightly darker than Cyndaquil`s, while the blue streak has been lowered to cover their eyes. As per the family line, Quilava sport short, coarse fireproof fur and have special vents on their heads and lower backs. Though they do not have a tail, the lower vents are positioned as to give the illusion of one.
Quilava are noted in the Pokédex to turn their backs toward their opponents in battle as a sign that they are about to use their flame-based abilities in battle, or to intimidate foes by demonstrating their power. Quilava are noted for their speed, and can nimbly evade attacks while scorching their enemies. They can also create gusts of superheated air, albeit to the same effect.</description>

On its back and tail are four red spikes. Totodile has a big and prominent jaw, filled with many sharp teeth; it is strong enough to cut down a tree. It`s very energetic, cheerful and rowdy, and occasionally can be seen running through swampy areas, biting and chomping at everything that moves.
In the anime, Ash acquires a Totodile after a duel with Misty to determine its rightful owner. Ash`s Totodile is rather carefree, fun loving, and loves to dance. It is shown to be friendly towards other Pokémon, and is a fast swimmer, as shown in Pokémon Heroes. Ash used Totodile in many battles throughout Johto, including the Johto League. A Totodile seen in the very first episode of the Johto series was very attached to Jessie from Team Rocket, or rather, her long hair (which Totodile loved to bite) that runs down her back. Ash`s Totodile is currently at Professor Oak`s lab since Ash decided to make a fresh start when going to Hoenn, and therefore, left all of his Pokémon except Pikachu with Professor Oak.</description>

Feraligatrs are massive, Godzilla-like crocodiles with long, blue bodies and four legs, although they may also stand upright on land. Their appendages have sharp claws at the ends, and its jaw is lined with teeth. On its head, back, and tail there are red, jagged scales. As stated in the Pokédex in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, "Feraligatr intimidates its foes by opening its huge mouth. In battle, it will kick the ground hard with its thick and powerful hind legs to charge at the foe with incredible speed."
Feraligatrs are ferocious and have a tendency to lash out at those that come too close. They eat Magikarp and other fish-like Pokémon, as well as larger prey (such as Stantler and Tauros) when they come close enough to the water.</description>

If it spots an enemy, it will cry out loudly to warn its kind. It will also hit the ground with its tail. A Sentret will only sleep when another one is standing guard. The Sentret will wake the others at the first sign of danger. Because of this, if one is separated from its pack, then it will be unable to sleep due to fear.

<description>Furret live in colonies with tunnels much too small for normal Pokemon to traverse, yet it is a perfect fit for the slim build of Furret as it hides from the outside world at the surface by traversing through these tunnels like gophers. These tunnel colonies become very complex, especially if they are very deep, and can potentially stretch for miles. Occasionally, these colonies are found intertwined with Diglett colonies. The Furret evolves from Sentret at level 15.
Furret`s rudimentary paws and legs are deceptively nimble, making Furret a quick, unpredictable predator especially skillful at hunting Rattata, its main prey. Also, the fur of the Pokemon is thicker than it appears, and Furret can fluff up its fur to make itself look much stronger and larger than it actually is as an intimidation tactic towards potential foes.

However, it actually has two feet; at least one is retracted against its body at almost all times, and Hoothoot can switch between one foot and the other at speeds almost too fast for the human eye. Hoothoot are also known for having precise senses of time, due to a special mechanism in their brain that measures the rotation of the earth. Properly trained, they can be more accurate than all but the most precise of clocks. In nature, they always begin hooting at the same time every night.</description>

<description>Noctowl is the second owl Pokémon, being the evolution of Hoothoot. It is a large bird whose plumage is colored in various shades of brown. Its round head has two piercing, red eyes and two large "eyebrows". These eyebrows help balance Noctowl while it is flying to increase its aerodynamics. When hunting, Noctowl puts its prodigious eyesight to good use to hunt down prey without fail. It is also very good at sneaking up to its victims unnoticed thanks to its supple, soft-feathered wings that allow it to fly without making any noise. When a Noctowl needs to ponder especially deep thoughts, it can rotate its head 180 degrees, which serves to increase its intellectual faculties.
In the anime, a shiny Noctowl has been part of Ash`s team during his travels in Johto. Ash frequently used his Noctowl to explore an area from the sky, or to puncture Team Rocket`s hot-air balloon. Ash used it in many battles throughout Johto, but it is currently living in Professor Oak`s lab since Ash decided to make a fresh start and leave all of his Pokémon except for Pikachu when he left for Hoenn.</description>

A Ledyba communicates with others through an aromatic fluid excreted from the points where its legs meet its thorax.

Male Ledian are shown having longer antennae than females.
Ledian is a nocturnal insect, active mainly during the night and sleeping in curled-up leaves during the day. Countless Ledian live in outdoor areas located a good distance away from the polluted atmospheres of cities, for the star-lit skies are always clearer in these clean lands than in the light pollution of urban areas. Ledian have an affinity to stars for good reason; They take their energy from the light of the stars in order to live healthily. When many stars are visible, the Ledian will sprinkle a mysterious, glowing powder whilst fluttering about.</description>

<description>Spinarak is a six legged spider-like Pokémon with a marking on its back that is similar to a face. It spins a web of fine silk and then waits patiently and with complete motionlessness until prey, such as a bug Pokémon, becomes ensnared in the sticky web. It then waits until nightfall, at which point Spinarak prepares and then devours the prey. The web can be called Spinarak`s "second nervous system" because the Pokémon is able to determine the type of prey that has become trapped simply through the vibrations that are created.
In the anime, there is a small town whose police force uses Spinarak to fight crime, honoring a Spinarak that had caught a criminal called the black arachnid in the past. This was shown in the episode Spinarak attack.</description>

Ariados` feet end in hooks that allow it to grip well enough to walk on vertical surfaces and on horizontal surfaces upside-down. Ariados uses its nest as a base of sorts. A strand of silk is constantly spun from its rear that leads back to its nest. This allows it to wander in search of food, which it usually does at night. This is in contrast to its unevolved form, Spinarak, which instead waits patiently for its prey to come to its web.</description>

Its habitat is the dark depths of the ocean floor. In the absence of any other light, Chinchou sees its surroundings and communicates by shooting positive and negative charged electricity particles between the tips of its antennae, creating an electric current and thus light. This can be said to be a form of bioluminescence. The charges Chinchou shoots between its antennae can also be used offensively, to stun its opponents with a flash of light or shock them with electricity.</description>

Given the nickname "deep-sea star", the light it emits is so bright that it can illuminate the sea`s surface from a depth of over 3 miles. It uses this light to attract and blind prey, and then swallow the immobilized prey in a single gulp. The light is also useful for Lanturn to navigate through the deep, murky waters. The light from its antenna is produced by bacterial symbiosis. Bioluminescent bacteria in Lanturn`s antenna cause a chemical reaction with Lanturn`s bodily fluids to create the bright light.</description>

<description>Pichu, known as the "Tiny Mouse" species of Pokémon, are the pre-evolved version of Pikachu. They stand at 1`00" and weight 4.4 lbs. Their cheeks are pink, and they have small, plump bodies with short, jagged tails, and large ears. They are not skilled at storing electricity, so when amused or startled, they often discharge jolts of electricity strong enough to affect adult humans. This lack of control becomes more stable as they grow older. The electricity that they do manage to keep stored is limited by their small electrical pouches in their cheeks. When the air is dry or on stormy days, they charge much more easily, leaving the sound of crackling static electricity emanating from them. They play with each other by touching tails to set off sparks, which also acts as a test of courage. They run the risk of shorting each other out, and scaring themselves into a crying fit with the flash of sparks that emanates from them. In the anime, it is said that a Pichu cannot use electric attacks without hurting itself. This is a feature not prominently featured in the games.
Pichu first appeared in Pokémon Gold and Silver, and is one of many pre-evolutions introduced into the series. At one point, a Nintendo GameCube game called Pichu Bros: Party Panic was in development but never released, featuring Pichu as the main character. Instead, the game was integrated into Pokémon Channel as an important part of the story-line.</description>

Cleffa first appears in Pokémon Gold and Silver, as one of the several pre-evolutions introduced into the series.
Cleffa love to stick their tongues out and are often seen hanging around other baby Pokémon such as Igglybuff. For unknown reasons, possibly due to its unusual star-shaped silhouette, when lots of meteors illuminate the night sky, sightings of Cleffa strangely increase. Some people believe that they came to the Pokémon universe on a meteor. If the impact site of any meteorite is found, this Pokémon is certain to be within the immediate area. On nights with many shooting stars, Cleffa can be seen dancing in a ringlike formation. They dance through the night and stop only at the break of day, when these Pokémon quench their thirst with the morning dew. Like Staryu, it is a Starshape Pokémon- consequently, scientists in the Pokémon universe are trying to find a connection between the two. In the same way its evolved form Clefairy loves the moon, Cleffa are fond of shooting stars.</description>

<description>Natu are very small, spherical, green birds with underdeveloped, textured wings, red talons, red tail feathers, and a red plume on each of their foreheads. Since their wings are not fully grown, Natu are unable to fly and therefore must hop around in order to get around. As a result of this, however, Natu`s jumping abilities are quite developed and they can hop great distances. They are diurnal herbivores that live in savanna areas. They forage for food on the ground by custom, but when a lack of food on the ground is apparent, Natu turn to the trees that grow in the savannas. With their strong jumping ability in their talons, Natu may either charge forward and quite literally run up the trunk of a small tree to reach a branch or use both their legs and their flapping wings to propel themselves onto higher tree branches well over seven feet off the ground. Once there, they peck at and feed on the tree`s recently grown shoots.
Natu have a peculiar nature in observing. Whenever they are seen, they always appear to be looking at something intently in particular. When a human makes eye contact with a Natu, the Pokemon will unfailingly stare back intently at him or her without hopping to safety, even though humans in comparison should be intimidatingly large. However, if that human moves even slightly, the Natu will suddenly hop away to safety.</description>

<description>Bellossom is a diurnal plant Pokémon. It evolves from Gloom if exposed to a Sun Stone. Bellossom`s petals can rotate, and they usually do when it is absorbing sunlight. The color of their leaves vary from a sickly brown and gray to a fluorescent yellow and red, depending on how much sunlight it has absorbed in the past few hours. When its petals are moving, either due to rotating or dancing, they rub together to make relaxing, bell-like sounds. The petals on its head also create a sweet scent.
It is also noted that a Bellossom will be even more beautiful if it was an especially rancid Gloom. The worse it smells as a Gloom, the prettier its petals will be as a Bellossom. Although naturally a peaceful and friendly Pokémon, it can be very territorial and violent fights can break out if there is an intruder or a challenger. Despite this, it is very social in areas outside of its self-determined territory, and the most common time to find a group of Bellossom together is when they all meet in one location to dance. It is said that these dances summon the sun.
Its Japanese name, "Kireihana", translates to "Beautiful" (kirei) and "Flower" (hana).</description>

<description>Marill is an aquatic mouse Pokémon. Marill`s tail floats like a buoy because it is filled with oil, which is less dense than water. When fishing at a fast-running stream, Marill wraps its tail around a tree. Since the tail is stretchy and flexible, it allows the Pokémon to get food and still stay safely anchored. Otherwise, when in a lake, it uses the buoy-qualities of its tail to keep itself suspended as the rest of its body dives underwater to feed on aquatic plants. Its fur is impermeable, which keeps it dry, and that allows it to swim through water at high speed without being slowed by the water`s resistance.
In the Pokémon Anime, Tracey, the Pokémon Observer from the Orange Islands, has a Marill which he uses on multiple occasions.</description>

<description>Azumarill is the evolved form of Marill. Azumarill resembles a blue, bipedal rabbit with a large, ellipsoid body, long blue ears with red insides, and a blue ball on the end of its thin, elastic black tail. The white bubble-like pattern on its lower stomach helps it to camouflage itself from potential predators when it is in the water.
Azumarill`s long ears act as sensors to identify sounds even in fast running rivers. Otherwise, when alone, Azumarill plays in water as a natural pastime, though it must roll up its elongated ears to prevent the sensitive sensory materials inside them from getting wet. The ball at the end of its tail can act as a sensor and guide it while under water. It can make thick, liquid balloons out of thin air with the saliva-water stored in its body. If it spots a drowning Pokémon in any body of water, it fashions such air balloons and jumps in to give the troubled Pokémon air balloons to help it breathe.
In the Pokémon anime, Paul owned an Azumarill which he used in a gym battle against Roark. Although it knew powerful Water attacks like Hydro Pump, it lost to Roark`s Geodude, which prompted Paul to give it to a Pokémon trainer passing by, being disappointed by its strength.</description>

<description>Sudowoodo is a bending, bipedal creature vaguely in the shape of a tree trunk. It has a double-pronged protuberance on its head, tiny feet, a simple face, and a pair of three-fingered hands where the fingers are green spheres resembling leaves on a tree. Although Sudowoodo pretends to be a tree, its body is made not out of wood, but rock. It uses this as a form of camouflage, hiding among forest areas to avoid being attacked by enemies. Additionally, its signature technique is Mimic, which allows it to copy enemy attacks. It earns its classification as the imitation Pokémon through these practices.
In the winter seasons, when trees are either white with snow or have had their leaves fall off from autumn, Sudowoodo is easy to spot as a fake because its hands remain green, making winter a more dangerous time for Sudowoodo to be in the presence of foes. Also, as a creature whose composition resembles rock, Sudowoodo hates water, so it will disappear and seek shelter when rainfall begins. In the video games, it often blocks areas until sprayed with water, which causes it to battle. In Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, the twig-shaped appendage atop a Sudowoodo`s head is larger on a male than it is on a female. The origin of its name is: Pseudo (False) + Wood.</description>

<description>Hoppip are small, spherical creatures, with long leaves protruding from their head. They have small, gripping feet and ears disproportionate to their body, used to listen for winds. Hoppip have extremely petite and almost weightless bodies, and are susceptible to strong winds due to this. When a Hoppip feels a gale approaching, it will lock the leaves on its head with the leaves of other Hoppip, in an attempt to avoid being blown away. If a Hoppip is by itself when in heavy winds, it may grip the ground with its feet to prevent this. Despite the dangers Hoppip face in strong winds, they enjoy gentle breezes and can float in the calmest of winds, which can carry them across vast distances.</description>

<description>Skiploom is the evolution of Hoppip. Skiploom is somewhat similar to its previous form, albeit larger, and green. It has long dog-like ears, rather than the Cat-like ones of Hoppip. The leaves have turned into a large yellow flower. The flower on its head blossoms at 64 degrees Fahrenheit. As the temperature increases, the flower gradually opens further. This allows Skiploom to be used as a thermometer. It is capable of floating in the air, a skill it uses to get closer to the sun in order to better absorb the sunlight. When the sunlight is strong, its ability, Chlorophyll, increases its speed. When it rains, the flower instantly closes and Skiploom hides under a tree to avoid getting wet.</description>

<description>Jumpluff is the final form of the Hoppip evolutionary line. Its body is a blue circle with three cotton balls around and has two small red eyes. They are a migratory species Pokémon. They take advantage of their light weight and fluffy, buoyant cotton balls to take to the skies. They are very adept at catching the warm southern winds and navigating their way to any location in the world, typically overseas and until they encounter a cold air current, whereupon they will begin landing. While floating, Jumpluff release spores that propagate its offspring around the world. This method of reproduction is reminiscent of dandelions.</description>

<description>Aipom resembles a purple squirrel monkey with its face forever frozen in a maniacal grin that can be described as rictus and a blank stare from its round eyes. On its thin tail is a three fingered hand-like appendage that is very dexterous. It provides both propulsion and balance while Aipom leaps from tree to tree. Aipom is not aggressive by nature and will attempt to tire its natural opponents through dexterous dodging of the opponent`s attacks in hope that the enemy will be discouraged and leave. Otherwise, if the enemy is persistent, the Aipom will try to retreat, but if it is unable to, it will attack by diving at its opponent from the trees.
In the anime, an Aipom steals Ash`s hat, and follows his group around until Ash battles and captures it. Ash`s Aipom is quite attached to him, getting incredibly jealous when it sees Pikachu on Ash`s shoulder. Aipom has the distinction of being the only Pokemon aside from Pikachu that Ash brought with him to Sinnoh, although inadvertently. Aipom seems to enjoy contests, and Dawn believes it prefers contests over battles. In "Throwing the Track Switch!", Ash trades Aipom for Dawn`s Buizel because both Pokemon seemed more interested in the other trainer`s training. In "Journey to the Unknown", Dawn`s Aipom evolves into Ambipom.</description>

<description>Sunkern are small, yellow-and-brown creatures with green leaves protruding from their heads. Sunkern`s entire life is centered around its evolution into a Sunflora. It moves as little as possible, trying to preserve the energy and nutrients it requires for the evolution process. According to the Pokédex, Sunkern`s diet is said only to be morning dew, which collects under the leaves of plants beneath it. The natural enemy of a Sunkern is Spearow as their only form of protection is shaking their leafy heads.</description>

<description>Sunflora is the evolved form of Sunkern. Sunflora is a diurnal sunflower Pokémon; unlike its unevolved form Sunkern, it is wholly inactive at night. However, it is very active and playful during the day when the sun is bright. Like Bellossom, it evolves using a Sun Stone. Sunflora prefer hot climates; their foliage becomes more colorful and elaborate as the temperature rises. Sunflora unfurl their petals and absorb sunlight for energy. It is possible for a Sunflora to absorb too much sunlight, though. When this happens, its head and petals become engorged and very heavy, which is dangerous for a Sunflora, since it can wilt and possibly get sick. At night, the petals are furled, covering Sunflora`s face.
A Sunflora is constantly soaking up sunlight and moving around in a blissful fashion. In preparation for winter, Sunflora will migrate to warmer and sunnier areas, so as not to lose the vital source of their energy. Sunflora like to live in flower patches. They do their best to stay hidden among the other flowers, but usually they are very noticeable.</description>

<description>Wooper are similar to Axolotl. They are light teal-colored Pokémon with round feet, no arms, and a long tail. Their simplistic face consists of mainly of a large mouth, primarily while open. They have purplish barbed antennae on the sides of their head. Three purple, though sometimes shaded blue or pink, gills are on its stomach. Wooper will usually live in cold water: however, they occasionally come out onto land in search of food. When doing so, they coat their bodies with slimy, poisonous film. Touching the slime with bare hands will cause a shooting pain. Male Wooper have two barbs on their antennae, while female Wooper have one barb. Males also have larger gills.</description>

<description>Quagsire has an appearance and habitat similar to that of a giant salamander. Quagsire live a carefree life in muddy ponds and rivers. It acts oblivious to its environment, accidentally bumping its head on the hulls of boats and bottoms of whatever body of water it swims in as it swims, but seeming not to care. Quagsire always bear an absent-looking facial expression. This is likely due to Quagsire`s easy-going nature. It hunts by staying still in the water with its mouth open, waiting for small prey to swim into its mouth. It doesn`t move, and therefore, doesn`t get hungry. It`s not uncommon that a fishermen`s hook will get caught in the gaping mouth of a feeding Quagsire. Trying to eat what it has caught, the Quagsire would try to swallow, and end up pulling the fishermen off his boat and into the water. Male Quagsire have larger fins on their backs. They wait at the bottom of lakes waiting for prey to wander into its mouth. It also loves eating cherries.</description>

<description>Espeon is an evolved cat-like form of Eevee that became available with the Japanese release of Pokémon Gold and Silver. The appearance of Espeon is said to resemble the Japanese mythological creature known as Nekomata which also displays the feline body with forked tail tip and solid colored eyes. An Espeon`s fur is used to sense air currents, allowing it to predict the weather, as well as the actions of its opponent in battle. Its forked tail quivers when this occurs. A red jewel rests on its head, and glows whenever Espeon uses its psychic abilities. Espeon are described as being very loyal to their trainers once they consider them worthy. They are also said to develop precognitive abilities in order to protect their trainers, Espeon become enabled to see into the future to identify potential threats. Eevee evolves into Espeon by having a high happiness level and leveling up during the day. A Sun Shard item can also be used in Pokémon XD, a Sun Ribbon in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue, Red, Explorers of Time, and Explorers of Darkness. Espeon`s name is derived from "ESP" and the suffix "-eon", as with every evolution of Eevee.</description>

<description>Umbreon is one of two Eevee evolutions that first featured in Pokémon Gold and Silver, the other being Espeon. It is called the "Moonlight" Pokémon. It has rabbit-like features displayed strongly in the shape of its head and eyes, a reference to the Japanese idea that you can see the head of a rabbit on the face of the moon. One of Umbreon`s most noticeable features is the yellow rings visible around its body. The Pokédex states that the rings will glow when Umbreon leaps to attack, becomes excited, or when there is a full moon. Umbreon are said to evolve as a result of love for their trainers and the moonlight; forcing one to walk during the day can also cause stress to it. They are described as preferring to lurk in darkness while waiting for their opponents to make the first move. If angered, they can secrete powerful poisonous sweat from their pores.</description>

<description>Murkrow is a small black crow with red eyes. The top of its head is styled as a witch`s hat and its tail bristles out like a broomstick. Murkrow is rather unpopular in the Pokémon world. Its dismal appearance and nocturnal nature have long caused it to be considered an omen of ill fortune to all who see it. If a Murkrow finds itself wounded, it fights back by leading its pursuer to dark mountain trails in an attempt to get him hopelessly lost in the darkness.
Murkrow is also attracted to bright, shiny objects, which it collects to stash in its nest. This, of course, leads to many arguments between Murkrow and Meowth, who both share a common love of stashing things - and taking from each other! It does not hesitate to steal such objects if necessary and has even been known to attempt to snatch rings off their owner`s fingers (and complete strangers too, for that matter). With the addition of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, it is revealed that some Murkrow are servants to its evolved form, Honchkrow, who spends all of its time preening and ordering the Murkrow around. Also with Diamond and Pearl`s release, Murkrow, like many other Pokémon, have gender differences. In this case, Males have a taller "hat" - technically, the crest that resembles a three-pointed witch hat - than females would. Murkrow can only be found wild in the Pokémon Diamond Version in Eterna Forest, while Misdreavus can only be found in Pokémon Pearl at the same location.</description>

<description>Slowking is one of the two different species Slowpoke can evolve into, Slowbro being the other. Slowking`s appearance is essentially identical to that of Slowpoke, with a few additions: it stands upright, it sports a red-and-white ruff around its neck and it has a bone-like structure on top of its head that is a cross between a helmet and a crown. This is actually a different form of Shellder, similar to the one biting Slowbro`s tail. When Slowking is viewed from behind, the eyes of the Shellder can be seen. The Shellder biting Slowking`s head injects toxins inside its brain every time Slowking yawns. The poisons interact with Slowking`s neural tissue to unlock mental faculties hitherto untapped, making Slowking considerably smarter and more alert than the sluggish Slowpoke or Slowbro. This makes it stand out among the aforementioned species, which recognize it as a leader of sorts.
The anime adds a ritualistic test to select the leader of the Slowpoke and Slowbro. A group of Slowpoke gather in a Shellder-infested lake, at the middle of which laid a King`s Rock. The Slowpoke that manages to dodge the Shellder and avoid evolving into Slowbro make it to the King`s Rock and places it on its head, whereupon a Shellder clamps on the rock, triggering Slowpoke`s evolution into Slowking.
Some Slowking have shown themselves capable of learning human speech, as seen in the movie Pokémon 2000 in which one helps Ash restore order to the world by getting three spheres protected by Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres.</description>

<description>Misdreavus is a moderately-sized, corporeal apparition that somewhat resembles the disembodied head of a human female. It lacks a nose, has thick, flowing "hair", and large, yellow eyes with red irises. It appears to wear a necklace of red pearls. Misdreavus lives deep in dark caves. It projects frightening screeching and wailing noises, as well as creepy, sobbing cries, at enemy Pokemon it encounters in the caves, so as to build up a level of fright strong enough so that the Pokemon will flee. Misdreavus` pearl necklace apparently serves as its means for feeding by absorbing the fearful feelings of targets for nutrition.
In the event that a human, trepid or otherwise, enters a cave area inhabited by a Misdreavus, the Pokemon will attempt to drive him or her out by biting and pulling at the intruding human`s hair, which is used for defense.</description>

<description>Unown is a hieroglyph-like symbol with 28 different forms, based on the letters of the Latin alphabet, a question mark, and an exclamation point. They always have the similarities of a flat body with black color and one medium-size eye. They always reside in mysterious chambers, only with other Unown, always stuck on walls.
Unown is featured in Spell of the Unown as the main antagonists. The Unown create an Entei to befriend a young girl and grant all of the girl`s wishes: in the girl`s case, turning the town she lives in into crystal. Ash and friends convince the girl that Entei is not her true father, since her father was lost on an archeological dig in an Unown temple. The Unown, overpowered by the girl`s current thoughts, became unable to control their powers and larger areas were turning into crystal. Entei saves them all by attacking the Unown, sending them all back to their dimension. It has also been revealed that Dialga and Palkia live in the same dimension as the Unown.</description>

<description>Wobbuffet is a stiff, blue, balloon-shaped Pokémon based on the late Japanese comedian Sanpei Hayashiya (林家三平) (1925-1980). Hayashiya`s trademark routine involved him putting one hand to his forehead and saying "Sou nansu, okusan" (そうなんす, 奥さん) ("So it seems, madam"). This is why, in the Japanese Pokémon anime and movies, Wobbuffet is often seen putting a hand to its forehead and shouting "Soooooonansu!" (which was translated as well for the English adaptation, where it indeed says "Woooooobbuffet!"). It is voiced by Kayzie Rogers.
Wobbuffet hates light and shock, so it lives in the quiet darkness of caves and only comes out at night. If attacked, it inflates its body to bolster its amazing ability to counter-attack using the moves Counter and Mirror Coat, rather than offensive battling like most other Pokémon, for it won`t attack on its own. It does nothing but endure attacks in this fashion, suggesting that Wobbuffet either has an inability to tolerate aggressive behavior on its part, or that it is simply built to withstand attacks. However, it will not endure an attack on its valued, sensitive tail. When that happens, the Pokémon will try to take the foe with it using Destiny Bond. To keep its pitch-black tail hidden from the sight of potential attackers, it lives in black caves and atmospheres as described above.
In the Pokémon anime, Jessie has owned a Wobbuffet ever since she accidentally exchanged her Lickitung for it in the episode Tricks Of The Trade. Wobbuffet is her equivalent of Misty`s Psyduck — it has a habit of popping out of its Pokéball at inopportune times without being called, including at the end of Team Rocket`s motto.</description>

<description>Girafarig is a herbivore that resembles a giraffe. It is yellow with dark brown spots for the front half, while the back half is dark brown with yellow spots. The back section is smaller on the females. Most notably, the end of Girafarig`s tail has a simplistic head. The head has a small brain of its own, but can only rely on instinct. If a person gets near the head, it reacts to the person`s scent and bites. The head doesn`t need to sleep, so it watches over its surroundings twenty four hours a day. Girafarig`s name is a palindrome in both English and Japanese, although the Japanese name`s palindromic nature is not evident in romanised form.</description>

<description>Pineco is a bagworm that resembles a pine cone in appearance. It is usually inactive, hanging from forest trees, where it waits for its prey of small flying insects to come to it. Pineco are capable of spitting out a sticky liquid that hardens when exposed to air. This has multiple uses, an example being Pineco using it to glue pieces of bark to themselves for protection, making them bigger and their hide more durable, much like the bagworm in real life. Like Voltorb and Electrode, Pineco explodes when startled or annoyed.
In the Pokémon anime, Brock catches a Pineco in the episode Goin` Apricorn! to save it from Jessie`s Arbok. It often exploded, no matter what its mood was, but it lost this habit later on when it evolved into a Forretress.</description>

When it spots prey, it lets go of the cliff`s face, spreads its wings and glides silently and effortlessly towards its target, as if it were sliding. This catches its victim by surprise when it flies straight to its face. It then uses its claws and pincers to secure its hold on the opponent`s face and injects it with poison from its tail barb to paralyze the prey. It is the first Flying-type Pokémon that is unaffected by Electric-type attacks. Ash Ketchum caught this Pokémon.</description>

<description>Granbull is a large, purple, bipedal bulldog with a pair of imposing, heavy fangs protruding from its lower jaw. The lower jaw is quite developed and, taken together with the fangs, heavy enough that Granbull must constantly decide between tipping its head back for balance and tilting its head down for decreased energy exertion. As its large mouth and fangs are built specifically for offense, Granbull can bite with a crushing amount of power. Granbull`s vicious appearance is a natural intimidation tactic meant to discourage any other Pokémon from assaulting it. In spite of its appearance, however, it is rather timid and easily spooked, and it only defends itself in retaliation to an assault upon it. When it is attacked by another Pokémon in the wild, Granbull flails about with its limbs to ward off its attacker.</description>

<description>Scizor is a human-size mantis similar to its evolutionary predecessor Scyther, with a thick, metallic red exoskeleton and crab-like claws. It is tougher and stronger than Scyther, but has lost its predecessor`s speed and ability to fly. Instead, it spreads its wings to cool off, and flaps them very rapidly to heat up, or to blow air to cool itself off. Its demeanor changes, as well. While Scyther is a mantis-like predator, striking fast and simply evading potential pursuers, Scizor is more crab-like, with a conservative, defensive demeanor, in keeping with its greater defensive ability and lesser speed. Once it engages its foe, either in the wild or at the direction of a Pokémon Trainer in a Pokémon battle, however, it behaves more like Scyther, striking quickly with its powerful claws, raking more than pinching, and relying on its startling agility to evade attacks.</description>

Shuckle employs a fluid secreted by its toes to dissolve rocks and carve them in a shape fit for its nest, the fluids are also occasionally used offensively against enemy Pokémon. Shuckle`s diet consists of berries, which it stores inside its shell to eat later. If stored long enough, the berries will eventually decompose and mix with Shuckle`s natural fluids to form a viscous liquid that makes a healing beverage aptly called "berry juice".It also notably has the best defence/special defence through the game.</description>

<description>Heracross is a large, blue, winged bipedal beetle. It has a capsule-shaped thorax similar to Pinsir`s, a pair of yellow eyes and two clawed arms and feet. Growing from its head is a large T-shaped horn, which is flanked on either side by a smaller antenna. Heracross is a powerful but docile Pokémon. Its natural habitat is forests and its diet consists of tree sap, nectar and honey. Its strength is such that it can topple large trees if it so wished. Heracross`s main weapon is its large horn, of which it is particularly proud. However, it only uses it in the wild to deter its foes, not hurt them.
In the Pokémon anime, Ash catches a Heracross in the episode A Sappy Ending. The Heracross is powerful, but also is distracted by sap, to the point where it tries to feed off the nectar of Ash`s Bulbasaur`s flower bulb when Bulbasaur is in sight. It is currently at Professor Oak`s lab.</description>

<description>Sneasel is a nocturnal weasel that lives in mountain forests. Sneasel is a deep blue-gray and has a golden jewel on its forehead and chest, and its claws are white. These claws are dangerously sharp, extremely durable, and are used for attacking. It hunts under the cover of chilly darkness, which allows it to sneak up on foes or lost prey. It also steals and eats eggs from nests. If the nest is guarded by a parent Pokémon, Sneasel scares the Pokémon away. It evolves into Weavile by leveling it up with Razor Claw at night.</description>

<description>Teddiursa is a bear cub, resembling a teddy bear more than a real bear. Teddiursa have a crescent mark on their forehead, which grows (both in thickness and in circumference) as the Pokémon ages. Once the crescent fully closes into a circle, the Teddiursa is ready to evolve into an Ursaring. Teddiursa, although an omnivore, has a diet that almost exclusively consists of honey. It makes its own honey out of fruit and pollen from Beedrill. It lets the honey soak in its paws, making it often lick its paws.</description>

<description>Ursaring is a large (although arboreal) bear with a yellow ring on its stomach. Ursaring eats food obtained from digging deep underground as well as berries from trees. Ursaring can hibernate through an entire winter without any food. Ursaring`s sense of smell is among the most developed of all Pokémon; it can detect subtle differences in scents. For this reason, Ursaring is sometimes used by police in the Pokémon universe, both as a strong enforcer, and as an explosive-sniffing Pokémon. If criminals are hiding in trees, it can use its claws to cut down the tree.
Its Japanese name, "Ringuma", originates from "ring" (ringu) and "bear" (kuma). In the anime, Ursaring is caught by Paul, after it is angered by Turtwig.</description>

<description>Magcargo is a snail composed of magma with a shell on its back. The shell is actually a thin outgrowth of its skin that hardened due to cooling of the air, in spite of the fact that it lives in the heat of volcanic craters. The shell is brittle and fragile enough that touching it will cause it to break and crumble, though Magcargo "grows" back its shell passively in a short amount of time. Magcargo has a body temperature of approximately 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Since Magcargo is composed of molten lava, when traveling at its slow pace it leaves parts of its continually hardening body on the ground behind it, thus decreasing its physical size. To lose too much of its mass is potentially deadly, so Magcargo routinely restores its size and vitality by dipping its body into volcanic pools of magma.</description>

<description>Piloswine has elements of wild boars and mammoths, but is most similar to muskox. Piloswine thrives in cold climates. It has adapted to such inhospitable environments; its thick, shaggy fur which covers its body almost completely shields it against the low temperature, while its rugged hooves provide traction on slippery and frictionless ice surfaces. Piloswine has difficulty seeing because the fur covers its eyes, but it compensates for that by being extremely sensitive to sound. If an ill-meaning individual makes an incriminating noise, Piloswine will home in on the threat and charge at it repeatedly, since it can`t see clear enough to tell when the danger has been neutralized.</description>

<description>Corsola is a dual-type Water/Rock Pokémon introduced in Generation II.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
In Galar, Corsola has a Ghost-type regional form. It evolves into Cursola starting at level 38.
Corsola is a small, pink, roundish Pokémon with branch-like growths on its back, which are similar to coral. There is a smaller, blunt horn on its forehead, and it has black, oval eyes. It has a white underside, which speckles towards the sides. Its four legs and two arms are blunt and stubby.
Found in the warm shallow waters of southern seas, Corsola requires clean water to live. If its habitat is dirty, the growths on its back become discolored and degenerate. However, when it is healthy, its growths regularly shed and grow back. It is able to regrow them over the course of a single night. It forms large social groups. Occasionally, these groups get so large that people may live atop them, as is the case in Pacifidlog Town. Corsola`s horn is a prized material, commonly used for jewelry and carving as seen in the anime. Smaller Pokémon like Seadra and Luvdisc are sometimes sheltered by Corsola`s branches, and even offer it protection from foes.
Galarian Corsola were wiped out by sudden changes in ocean temperature caused by a meteor impact, turning them into Ghost-types. Its body is a bleached white with half-closed pink eyes and a perpetual frown, and its arms and branches have a distinctly semitransparent appearance to them; the branches can be used to take root inside and drain the life force of others.
The branches cannot cause injures or pain, but they immobilize the victim until Galarian Corsola lets them go. They are commonly found in the remains of prehistoric seas, and while they can be mistaken for ordinary rocks, they will curse anybody who kicks them by accident.
In the Alola region, Mareanie and Toxapex are natural predators of Corsola. However, they do not fulfill those roles in the Galar region, having not realized the branches of Corsola are delicious.</description>

<description>Remoraid is a Remora-based suckerfish that scavenges for food and has a somewhat symbiotic relationship with Mantine. Remoraid will attach itself to the underbelly of Mantine with its dorsal fin, eating scraps of food that Mantine drops as well as the parasites on them that causes them to itch. In return, the Mantine helps defend the Remoraid from enemies. When not scavenging for food, Remoraid will strike down its own prey with precise accuracy using fast streams of airborne water, which Remoraid shoots from its mouth using abdominal muscles. Remoraid can move faster through the water by blasting water from its mouth in the opposite direction of where it intends to move.</description>

Octillery is a carnivore; they catch fish with their tentacles, and kill (and afterwards eat) it by smashing the rocky protrusions on its head into its opponent`s skull. Octillery is a nesting creature, in that it sleeps in burrows it prepares; however, its nests are temporary structures only, and it rarely uses the same nest two nights in a row.</description>

Its large and well-developed wings enable it to briefly leap over the sea`s surface if it builds up enough speed, in a manner similar to some real aquatic species. Mantine is a filter feeder, like whales; its diet consists of most things that happen to enter its mouth while swimming.</description>

Skarmory`s wings become battered from repeated battles, so it grows the feathers back to the original state once a year. Feathers from Skarmory have been used by people of the past as knives and swords. It is based on the Stymphalian birds of Greek mythology.</description>

These antlers change the flow of the air, causing the space around them to act as a distorted reality, and leaving other beings around the Stantler confused and lost in their senses. This allows it to create hallucinations to aid it in battle or allow it to escape. The antlers are considered art in the Pokémon world, causing the Stantler to almost be hunted to extinction as the trading market of the antlers reached very high prices. The orbs on fallen antlers is often grounded up to a powder that helps people sleep. Stantler`s name is derived from stag, meaning a male deer, and antler, referring to the horn-like growths on its head.</description>

The Pokémon that it evolves into is based upon the attack and defense statistics of the Tyrogue at the point of evolution. Tyrogue is very energetic; it puts this energy into training. It constantly challenges, or randomly attacks, different Pokémon in order to get stronger, though it often ends up with injuries caused by much stronger Pokémon. Even if it loses, it will never give up on its training. If a captive Tyrogue doesn`t have various set training methods established by its trainer, it will often become stressed. Tyrogue and its evolutions are based as all male.</description>

<description>Hitmontop has a sharp point on the top of its head which allows it to balance itself upside-down on its head, the position which it holds in much of the time while it is observed. While it can walk upright, it often travels by spinning like a top, letting it travel much faster. Using the centrifugal force to boost its attack by ten times, it launches elegant kicks while spinning. This allows it to throw off its opponent`s timing, and give it a good mix of offense and defense. If it spins fast enough, it can dig into the ground. Any punch or hand based moves breed into or learned by a Tyrogue will carry into either of its evolved forms. This means that even a Hitmontop can know a move like Mach Punch or High Jump Kick.</description>

They are awakened in this tower in their first appearance. Another myth maintains that Raikou descended to earth together with a lightning bolt. Each Beast personifies a force of nature - Raikou, in particular, embodies the speed of lightning.
Like many Electric-type Pokémon, Raikou stores tremendous energy inside its body. This grants it extraordinary vitality, allowing it to run continuously across the land while shooting off electricity from the rain cloud that is on its back. Raikou`s roar is aptly described as "thunderous": it is loud enough to create shock waves and shake the ground as if actual thunder had struck.
Raikou is featured in a special anime episode called Raikou - The Legend of Thunder that forms the first three episodes of Pokémon Chronicles. In the special, two Team Rocket agents named Attila and Hun scheme to capture Raikou with a device that reflects and deflects energy blasts. Three New Bark Town trainers risk their own lives to try and save Raikou. It is thought by the trainers that Raikou attempts to guard other electric Pokémon from danger whenever possible.</description>

Entei is an embodiment of magma, being able to launch powerfully searing, fire that is hotter than magma from its mouth. This fire consumes everything that it touches. When it roars, volcanos around it are apparently triggered to erupt. Due to being unable to fully control its own power, it constantly sprints around the world.
Entei is the main Pokémon in the movie Pokémon the Movie 3: Spell of the Unown, in which the Unown create it from Molly`s imagination.</description>

It also embodies the compassion of a spring, so as it travels, it seeks out pure reservoirs of water, and using its power, it instantly purifies dirty, muddy, or otherwise polluted water into the clearest of liquids by simply stepping into it.
In Pokémon Crystal Suicune is the star Pokémon, in a similar way that Pokémon Gold showcased Ho-oh or Pokémon Silver showcased Lugia. Eusine, a mysterious trainer, appears throughout the course of the game. He is set on meeting and catching Suicune, and will battle the player for that honor. Eventually, Suicune can be caught by heading to the Tin Tower after obtaining the Clear Bell.

<description>Lugia is a legendary Pokémon that first appears in Pokémon Gold and Silver, appearing on the boxart for Silver. Lugia, thought to be the guardian of the sea, resides deep in the ocean floor. It spends most of its time at the bottom of the sea due to its tremendous power, which includes being able to topple houses just by flapping its large, powerful wings and the ability to start storms that can last for over forty days. It is usually seen near the beginning of storms, and it often uses its wings to calm them.
It plays the role of a general legendary Pokémon in some games, where it waits in a far-off location, ready to battle. Lugia is one of the main characters of Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness. The storyline of the game depicts a "Shadow" Lugia terrorizing the locals and wreaking havoc. It is the only Shadow Pokémon whose physical appearance is different from its regular state. Shadow Lugia is said to be struggling, asking for help to free it from doing Cipher`s work in which "its deeper closed heart refuses to do". The player has to catch and Purify it for it to return to its original state.
In Pokémon: The Movie 2000, Lugia comes from the sea when the three Legendary Birds Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres are roused by a Pokémon collector who tries to catch the trio. Lugia then battles the raging Birds and, with the help of Ash and Team Rocket, manages to calm them and restore peace to nature. Lugia makes a second appearance in the Pokémon TV series when the protagonist, Ash, travels to the Whirl Islands where he meets his friend Richie to help stop a Team Rocket scientist from separating a young Lugia named "Silver" from her parent.</description>

<description>Ho-Oh is a legendary Pokémon that first appears in Pokémon Gold and Silver, appearing on Gold`s boxart. Long ago in Ecruteak City, there were two towers, the Brass Tower and Tin Tower being the roost of Lugia and Ho-Oh, respectively. When the Brass Tower burned down, both Pokémon fled, never to be seen again. Three Pokémon became trapped in the flames of the Brass Tower and perished. Ho-Oh returned to the Burned Tower and resurrected the three Pokémon, who were renamed Raikou, Entei, and Suicune. It has an unknown gender. On Gold, it is Lv40 when caught while it is Lv70 when caught in Silver. It is better to have the lower version as the move tutor does not exist in Gold/Silver.
It is called the Rainbow Pokémon due to its various associations with rainbows. Its feathers constantly change through the rainbow`s spectrum of colors as light hits them from different angles. These leave a rainbow trail as it flies continuously through the world`s skies, though it is said to live at the foot of a rainbow. It is said to appear before pure-hearted trainers as the representative of the bonds between humans and Pokémon, and bring happiness to all that see it. This is expanded upon in the anime, where it is said to appear before a hero. Ash Ketchum sees Ho-Oh various times throughout his journey, the first time being before Gold and Silver were even announced. It remained a mystery until it was revealed in Pokémon Gold.</description>

It is an omnivore, able to eat almost anything, and it will attempt to take a bite out of anything that moves when it first sees it. This Pokémon is both aggressive and cowardly; it chases after prey until the victim becomes exhausted, but if the prey strikes back, Poochyena may turn tail and run away.</description>

<description>Zigzagoon is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation III.
It evolves into Linoone starting at level 20.
In Galar, Zigzagoon has a Dark/Normal-type regional form. It evolves into Galarian Linoone starting at level 20, which evolves into Obstagoon when leveled up at night starting at level 35.
Zigzagoon is a raccoon-like, quadruped Pokémon with bristly, zigzag-patterned fur. It has stripes formed by alternating layers of cream and brown fur. It has a brown head with spiky ears and a black nose. A black, mask pattern surrounds its brown eyes. The upper half of its mouth is jagged, and when it is open, there are two pointed teeth in its lower jaw. Its feet have three claws and pink paw pads. Its forefeet are cream-colored, but the hind feet are brown. Its brush tail is spiky and bristly.
In Galar, the oldest and original form of Zigzagoon have a more black and white patterned-fur. The red eyes are surrounded by a black spiked mask. The black feet contains three sharp white claws. It has a long pink tongue that is constantly standing outside of mouth with two lower teeth in between.
Zigzagoon is abundantly curious, as it wanders restlessly back and forth while rubbing its nose to the ground in search of something. It rubs its bristly back hair against trees to mark its territory, and plays dead to fool opponents in battle. Zigzagoon is found commonly in grassy fields. The Zigzagoon in Galar are known to be constantly on the move and never settling down. It is believed that the zigzag movements of the Zigzagoon from other regions originated from its Galar relatives. They enjoy battling to the point they often attempt to prove others into fighting it. While this succeeded with other Pokémon, humans instead mistaken it wanting affection, much to the Zigzagoon`s frustrations.</description>

<description>Lotad is both an aquatic and a land-dwelling Pokémon, found in the Hoenn region, with a lilypad growing on its back. This species lives in groups at ponds, with their bodies submerged while suspended at the surface by their buoyant leaves, as a measure of hiding from predators. When on dry land, Lotad scuttles towards other ponds because its leaf is too heavy to support, in contrast to Lotad`s ancient ancestors which were one primarily land-dwelling Pokémon. Lotad and its evolved forms have mouths resembling duck bills, which may be a pun on the duckweed.
In the Pokémon anime, a Lotad becomes one of the Pokémon in trainer Brock`s possession in the third-generation Hoenn story arc in a development considered ironic because previously Brock primarily used Pokémon of the Rock and Ground types. His Lotad eventually evolved into Lombre, and then Ludicolo.</description>

<description>Seedot is an acorn-like Pokémon found in the Hoenn region. It feeds by using the top of its head to attach itself to a tree branch and then proceed to suck moisture and nutrients from it. In this state, when still, it is seemingly impossible to distinguish it from a real acorn. It apparently appreciates this fact because it enjoys startling Pidgey foraging in the area by suddenly moving. When Seedot finishes feeding, its body becomes heavy enough that it drops to the ground with a clear thump.</description>

It has the habit of carrying prey and valuables in its beak, and has been known to hide them in all sorts of locations. Sejon rides the winds and flies as if it were skating across the sky.</description>

<description>Pelipper is the larger and stronger evolved form of the Wingull Pokémon species found in the Hoenn region. This uniquely proportioned pelican is usually found by or over oceans or other large bodies of water. It builds its nest on high cliffs facing the sea, and is able to rest on top of waves to regain energy. Pelipper skims the tops of waves while it hunts for its prey, which are typically fish Pokémon. When Pelipper spots its prey, it dips its large beak into the water and scoops it up. It then proceeds to swallow it whole. Pelipper also carries the eggs of its Wingull offspring inside its beak before and after they hatch. This provides the offspring with protection and, after they hatch, nourishment from the hunted food.</description>

<description>Team Rocket is a highly organized criminal syndicate "in pursuit of evil" headed by Giovanni (called "The Boss" by his underlings) and based in Kanto. Its main focus is in stealing or capturing, then selling, rare and/or strong Pokemon, but it also conducts cruel experimental research on Pokemon. According to the Generation II games, the Team Rocket Oath says: "Steal Pokemon for profit. Exploit Pokemon for profit. All Pokemon exist for the glory of Team Rocket." Team Rocket`s final goal is to take over the world using Pokemon.
In the anime, Team Rocket is based in Kanto, with many smaller branches reaching out in Kanto and Johto. Giovanni is the Gym Leader of Viridian City during the early part of Ash`s journey. There is also an underground school for training aspiring Team Rocket members. In addition, Team Rocket had its headquarters near Pallet Town and Viridian City, but this was destroyed by Mewtwo in its rage; it is unknown where the headquarters are now. All that is known is that the headquarters are now in a large building built at the end of a canyon and guarded by many grunts, seen when Jessie, James, and Meowth returned from the Hoenn region to report back to Giovanni.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Sakaki is the head of Team Rocket, and formerly served as the Gym Leader of Viridian City`s Gym, known officially as the Viridian Gym. He handed out the Earth Badge to Trainers who defeated him. As a Gym Leader, he specialized in Ground-type Pokémon, but his master plan includes collecting rare Pokémon of all types.
Very little is known about his past in any timeline; he is generally shrouded in mystery. However, certain things are known:
His mother was the head of Team Rocket before him. However, this is presumed to be canon in the anime timeline only, as the games have no precedent for this.
While Sakaki very rarely takes the role of antagonist, his agents often have him in mind during missions due to the chance of power, be it through promotion or other means. This gave him a unique series of appearances, mainly during the Hoenn saga, where Nyarth often saw how the Pokémon in each episode could be used to help Sakaki and win the trio promotions. These boss fantasies never show his actual personality and occasionally even show Sakaki in chibi form.
The only time Sakaki has been seen in battle was in The Battle for the Badge. He used powerful Pokémon against Shigeru but later left the Gym to deal with an unexplained emergency, leaving Satoshi to battle Musashi. By the time Satoshi returned from Hoenn, Agatha was in charge of the Gym until a new leader could be found. Sakaki`s reasons for leaving it have not been explained, though it is speculated to be linked with the events of the aforementioned episode.
Sakaki is one of the three most prominent figures speculated to be Satoshi`s father, alongside Professor Okido and Silver. There is no evidence to support this, though Diamondshippers see Sakaki`s avoidance of Satoshi mentioned above as suspicious. In Pokémon Live!, it was claimed that Sakaki and Delia had shared a relationship as teenagers, though it is also stated that someone else is Satoshi`s father in that particular canon.</description>

<description>Jessie is one half of of the Team Rocket duo that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokemon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
Jessie`s mother, Miyamoto, was a high-ranking Team Rocket agent. When Jessie was around the age of three, Miyamoto left on a mission to the Andes Mountains to record the voice of the elusive Pokemon Mew. However, Miyamoto disappeared, and Jessie was put into a foster home which had very little money. There were times when she had no choice but to eat snow because of a lack of more nourishing food.
When she was old enough, she left home to become a Pokemon nurse in Jouto. However, the school she was enrolled in was literally for Pokemon nurses (i.e. Chansey), so she failed to graduate and left, leaving behind a Chansey she had befriended there. It is assumed that she then traveled back to Kanto, where she enrolled in Pokemon Tech, a trainer`s school, met James, and subsequently failed and dropped out. After this, Jessie and James joined a bicycle gang in Sunny Town, where Jessie was known for swinging a chain above her head as she rode her bike (nicknamed "Chainer Jess").
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between Jessie and James after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Sometime before joining Team Rocket, and it is not known when, Jessie obtained a Contest Pass in the Hoenn region. Also during the years before Team Rocket, she had several boyfriends, all of whom left her and/or treated her badly. In "Xatu the Future", she revealed that she had once worked at a T.V. station as the Weathergirl. In "From Cradle to Save" is also revealed that she once was a ninja.
She has a long-standing bitter rivalry with Cassidy, another member of Team Rocket. Another member, Wendy, held a grudge against Jessie for failing to pay for a drink (making Wendy pay), but got her revenge when she added the charge to Jessie`s overall Team Rocket bill.
In the episode "Ignorance is Blissey", Jessie was reunited with her friend Chansey from the Pokemon nurse school; Chansey had since evolved into a Blissey.
Starting in Hoenn, Jessie has become a Pokemon Coordinator, entering every contest that she could. She frequently makes it to the battle round, but usually loses there. However, in "Borrowing on Bad Faith", she finally succeeded in winning an (unofficial) contest by using Ash`s Aipom, which she had saved earlier in the episode. And, in "Team Shocker!", she finally wins an official contest with her Dustox in at Solaceon City. Later she also won a ribbon with help of her Yanmega. She has Contest Passes to compete in the Hoenn, Kanto, and Sinnoh regions.
While Jessie`s role in the Pokemon anime has not yet ended, in Toshihiro Ono`s manga, "The Electric Tale of Pikachu", she ended up married to James and with child.
Jessie seems to have a special preference for snake-like Pokemon, owning both an Arbok and a Seviper. In "The Ninja Poke Showdown", she expressed a preference for Poison-type Pokemon in general.
For unknown reasons, she, James and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation.
In the Kanto contests, Jessie disguises herself as Jessebella (which is similar to James former fiancee Jessiebelle) wearing a red dress and glasses. Eventually, Ash, Brock, Max and May finds out her true identity at the last contest.
During the Kanto Grand Festival, Jessie dresses up as Jessadia (Japanese: キャンディ・ムサリーナ Candy Musalina). and wears glasses, long white socks, a yellow and orange dress, and has her hair in pigtails. She works there as an announcer and Lilian Meridian`s assistant; Lilian herself says she may not really like "Jessadia"`s style, but recognizes her talent. In the Latin American dub, she enters Super Contests under the name Jessiebella (referencing Jessiebelle again). Jessie currently still continues to use the Jessalina disguise while participating in Super Contests.
In "Pruning a Passel of Pals!" and "Strategy With a Smile!" she once again used her Jessadia disguise to report on the Wallace Cup.
Although Jessie had entered mostly every contest in Hoenn &amp; Kanto, she lost in every single one, whether it was the first match of the Battle Rounds or the finals. But in the Sinnoh Region, she has so far won 2 ribbons using her Dustox and Yanmega.</description>

<description>Meowth is a very unique Pokémon as it has many of the characteristics of a human. It walks on two feet, talks and is as smart as any human. Meowth is currently a member of Team Rocket and he travels around with Jessie and James trying to capture Pikachu and other rare Pokémon for Giovanni.
Meowth generally finishes his sentences with "Nyaa (ニャー)" which is the equivalent of "meow" in English. This helps people remember that despite his ability to talk like a human, he still has cat character traits.
Meowth is also known for coming up with his many schemes to try to capture Pikachu. While Jessie and James always agree with Meowth and think his plans are brilliant, they are generally foiled by Ash and his friends.
Long Con to Access Raimon City Pokémon Center
Meowth schemed with Jessie, James and Doctor Zager to figure out a way for them to infiltrate the Raimon City Pokémon Center where high-leveled Pokémon are stored in a vault that is protected by a security machine scan system that would only open if Nurse Joy (Isshu) or Nurse Joy`s Audino were scanned. Meowth pretended to be no longer part of Team Rocket making up a story that his made an error while executing a certain operation and when headquarters hear of his mistake, they told him he was fired.
Ash, Iris and Cilan believed him and allowed Meowth to travel with him. Pikachu though didn`t trust Meowth even though Meowth proved on numerous occasion that it should be trusted. Meowth`s plan was put into action when they arrived at the Raimon City Pokémon Center and as soon as Nurse Joy`s Audino was scanned to open the door, Meowth turned on Pikachu and the other and captured all the Pokémon in the vault. The long con had been a success and Meowth met up with Jessie and James below the Pokémon Center. Unfortunately, they weren`t able to get away as Ash and his friends realized that Meowth had just been conning them and they were able to stop Team Rocket.</description>

<description>James is one part of of the Team Rocket trio that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokémon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
James is mostly a comedic parody of bishounen characters; the English dub in particular tends to give him a melodramatic and even campy tone. He is somewhat famous for carrying a rose, though in more recent episodes he does not display it often. Mostly, his rose is displayed in the Team Rocket motto.
The only child of millionaires, James was forced to endure formal society. At a young age, he was forcefully engaged to a girl of whom he was terrified, Jessiebelle, all because his parents wanted to have a wealthy daughter-in-law. Thus, he ran away from home, leaving behind his beloved pet Growlie. He attempted to enroll in Pokémon Tech, a trainer`s school, but, along with his new friend Jessie, flunked out. Then, with Jessie, he joined the Sunny Town bicycle gang, where he was popular for being the only gang member to have to use training wheels (nicknamed "Trainer Jim"). Eventually James, Jessie, and the bike gang went their separate ways.
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between James and Jessie after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Since he is proficient in several activities, including Pokémon haiku and PokéRinger, it is possible that he developed his skills during his temporary separation from Jessie, but this is not known for sure.
In the episode "Holy Matrimony!", James returned to his home as a result of a trap by his parents, who pretended to be dead. He was reunited with his old pet Growlie and managed to avoid marrying Jessiebelle. Growlie stayed behind when James returned to Jessie and Meowth.
James has a tendency to be swindled by a Magikarp Salesman, who has on many occasions tricked him into buying a Magikarp or other useless Pokémon and items for large sums of money.
James also has a tendency to cross-dress, but has not done it since "Pros and Con Artists". He does, however, dress up like famous celebrities as well, such as Professor Oak, Juan, and Norman.
James loves rare bottle caps and has an impressive collection of them. In the episode "All That Glitters!" it is revealed that he has "drunk enough soda pop to float an aircraft carrier".
For unknown reasons, he, Jessie and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation. However in newer episodes the balloon is shown with `jets` attached to explain how they get from one place to another faster than walking.</description>

<description>Butch is one half of of the Team Rocket duo that occasionally runs across Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokémon anime.
Butch`s partner is Cassidy, and she is one of the few that usually manages to get his name right- much to his frustration, everyone else calls him either "Biff", "Bill", "Bob", "Hutch", "Butcher", "Patch", "Botch" or "Chuck" (コサンジ Kosanji in Japanese). Sometimes when she gets it right, he, by habit, tries to correct her and ends up calling himself the incorrect name. Everyone getting his name wrong has become a running gag in the anime. This, of course, annoys him to no end. He once even said in frustration, "That does it, I am changing my name."
Butch is named after Butch Cassidy, an American outlaw. His Japanese name, Kosaburo, is meant to diminish his status when compared to James. 二郎 Jirou is a name meaning "second son," while 三郎 Saburou means "third son." Kojiro (James) takes advantage of Jirou, while Kosaburo takes advantage of Saburou.</description>

Cassidy and Jessie met either before or shortly after their both joining Team Rocket, and are assumed to have been rivals since then. The two women are almost equally vain. However, unlike Jessie, Cassidy keeps her cool easier and is much less prone to violent outbursts. Cassidy annoys Jessie to no end with her arrogance, and it appears that Cassidy likes instigating this frustration.
Cassidy is named after Butch Cassidy, an American outlaw. Her Japanese name, Yamato, is named after the 大和 Yamato, a World War II-era Japanese battleship. Its sister ship was the 武蔵 Musashi, one of Jessie`s namesakes.</description>

<description>Hun is a member of Team Rocket. He appeared along with his partner, Attila, in "The Legend of Thunder!".
Like the other Rocket duos, his and his partner`s names together form the name of a famous historical villain, in this case, Attila the Hun.
Hun and Attila both seem somewhat set in their rank, and approach missions casually. They seem to be able to keep their cool even when they lose; even in these situations, they calmly retreat. Despite physical stereotypes, Hun is the dominant partner telling Attila to do things that he could do himself. Attila doesn`t object or show any signs of aggravation over this role.
Attila has no recorded history with his partner Hun though, while the dub states that they are new partners, their body language and the familiarity of the behavior towards each other shows that they do have some history together.
The pair takes mission orders from Professor Sebastian, but it is implied in the original that they have never met him before "The Legend of Thunder!". Still, in the dub, he seems to have some kind of friendship with the professor.
Hun was male in the original Japanese version. However, his gender was controversially changed to female in the English dubbed version. Closer analysis showed that Hun was never referred to as a female (but he has long hair and bangs, a feminine hairstyle in some countries). The only pronouns are those used collectively with Attila, such as "those men" or "those guys". So, Hun may just be a male with a female voice. In the Brazilian version, however, Hun was referred to as ela and dela. Likewise, in the European Portuguese he is named Ana, which is a name that usually is given to woman.</description>

<description>Dr. Namba is a scientist of Team Rocket.
He first appeared in the Lugia saga that comprised of "The Mystery is History", "A Parent Trapped" and "A Promise is a Promise". He has since appeared in number of episodes giving Butch and Cassidy their mission briefings, though this was only as a vocal role in all except "Oaknapped". He is believed to be in his 50s or 60s. His name is often mispronounced, and he has a short temper.
Little is known about Namba. It can be speculated that since he does order scientists and agents within Team Rocket, he is either very knowledgeable about his field or that he has been with the group for a while, climbing the corporate ladder at Team Rocket. Also, in the Japanese version of his appearances on Pokémon Chronicles, Namba demands Butch and Cassidy to capture rare Pokémon for something he calls the `R Project.`
Aside from the already mentioned fact of him ordering a cadre of scientists and agents, two notable agents that he orders are Butch and Cassidy.</description>

<description>Professor Sebastian is a member of Team Rocket who has appeared in several episodes of the Pokémon anime.
He appeared in "The Legend of Thunder!", and later on in the main series during "Talkin` `Bout an Evolution" and "Rage of Innocence".
Every occasion he is seen by the viewer, he remains calm and talks with a steady even tone. As he is only seen in moments of scientific importance and victory, it cannot be said if this demeanor carries over to every situation, or if this behavior has been modulated to the scientific environment and all business that stems from there on in.
Some within fanon speculate that he might be the most powerful Rocket scientist. Not taking in other issues, one can say that he has spent an impressive amount time working for the group.
He works with Tyson and gives commands to Hun and Attila. Tyson seems to hold at least his scientific mind in great regard. As Hun, Attila, and Tyson are of the same rank, Sebastian might work with agents of their rank often.
He is in charge of a sizeable crew of scientists, and they seem to work on a variety of things. He is known for the creation of the crystal system that traps Electric-type Pokémon with their own power and a beam that forces Pokémon to evolve.
The origin of his Japanese name is probably after the sword style Shiranui-ryu. Humorously, Jessie refers to him as "pointy" when she meets him.</description>

<description>Koga was the Gym Leader of Fuchsia City`s Gym, known officially as the Fuchsia Gym. He is a student of ninjutsu who specializes in Poison-type Pokémon. He handed out the Soul Badge to trainers who defeated him. Later, in the Generation II games, he is promoted to the Elite Four, leaving his daughter in charge of the Gym.
Koga`s only anime appearance was in the episode "The Ninja Poké Showdown".
Koga is a ninja who trains in an old mansion, the Fuchsia City Gym, in the woods outside Fuchsia City. The Gym is filled with traps such as fake mirrors, invisible walls, pits, and many Voltorb. Aya, Koga`s younger sister, is one of his students.
Ash, Misty, and Brock managed to overcome the traps in the Gym and Ash was finally able to challenge Koga. Although Ash`s Pidgeotto initially lost to Koga`s newly-evolved Venomoth, prompting Ash to call out Charmander, their match was interrupted when Team Rocket tried to steal Koga`s large supply of Voltorb, although they had raided the Gym with the intent of getting Poison-type Pokémon. Team Rocket was stopped by Psyduck, allowing Ash and Koga to have a rematch. Pitting Charmander against Koga`s Golbat, Ash triumphed and won the Soul Badge.</description>

<description>Aya is a ninja and Pokémon trainer who specializes in Poison-type Pokémon. She is the younger sister of Koga, the Fuchsia City Gym Leader, and is a student of the Gym. Apparently, she was raised by Koga since she was young. She also has interest in poetry.
Aya made her first appearance in "The Ninja Poké Showdown" where they encountered Ash, Misty, and Brock in the Fuschia City Gym. Aya challenged Ash to a battle with her Venonat and Ash agreed - sending out Bulbasaur. He won the match easily.
Aya appeared again in "Ariados, Amigos!" where she was training at a nearby dojo, learning Pokémon Jujitsu. She and her Venonat were unable to master it. But after an encounter with Team Rocket, she was able to bring out her Venonat`s full potential and defeat them. She then returned to the dojo to fully master Pokémon Jujitsu.</description>

<description>Lt. Surge is the Gym Leader of Vermilion City`s Gym, known officially as the Vermilion Gym. He hands out the Thunder Badge to Trainers who defeat him. He specializes in Electric-type Pokémon.
Lt. Surge made his only anime appearance in "Electric Shock Showdown", and in flashback appearances focused on Ash`s Pikachu.
Lt. Surge is an extremely large and muscular man, and seems to be the show`s tallest human character. He is arrogant, loud, and crude, and refers to all trainers as "babies" until they manage to defeat him. Lt. Surge generally looks down on unevolved Pokémon, preferring to evolve them as soon as possible.
His Raichu shares many of his personality traits, also appearing to be rather tough. Lt. Surge`s fatal weakness was that he evolved his Pokémon too quickly without taking the time to teach them the proper attacks. Even though he managed to defeat Ash and his Pikachu once with pure power, Pikachu was able to use speed-altering moves like Agility to get the best of Raichu.
In the anime, the Vermilion Gym appears to be a warehouse decorated with stylized lighting bolts.</description>

<description>The Beginning
Ash is the main character of the Pokémon anime. Raised in Pallet Town, he started his journey to become a Pokémon Master at the age of 10. On the day that he started his journey, Ash carelessly woke up late despite being told by his mother, Delia Ketchum to get to bed. He rushed to Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory only to find out that the beginner Pokémon - Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander - had already been given out to trainers who arrived on time. However, Professor Samual Oak mentioned that there was one more Pokémon available - Pikachu. Despite constantly hitting Ash with Electric-type attacks and refusing to return to its PokéBall, Ash decided to take Pikachu along with him on his journey to become a Pokémon Master. Pikachu is cold towards Ash at first and laughs at his failures; however, when Ash saves Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow, he begins to warm up to his new trainer and the two finally become friends. After the battle with the flock of Spearow, a Ho-Oh is seen flying towards a rainbow in the sky. The PokéDex reveals that the Ho-Oh is an unidentified Pokémon. Thus, the journey of Ash and Pikachu begins.
Captures in Viridian Forest
While making his way towards Pewter City and his first Kanto League Gym Battle, Ash came upon a wild Caterpie deep within Viridian Forest. Instead of using Pikachu to battle against the wild Pokémon, Ash took his chances and threw a PokéBall without weakining the Caterpie first. Luckily, he was able to catch the Pokémon without any trouble. The capture of Ash`s Caterpie marked Ash`s first capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Caterpie the second Pokémon to join his team.
The next day, while continuing the trek through the Viridian Forest, Ash came up on a wild Pidgeotto. He tried to just throw a PokéBall like he did with Ash`s Caterpie, but Pidgeotto swatted the PokéBall away. Misty informed that he must weaken the Pokémon first before attempting to capture it. He called out Ash`s Caterpie to battle against, but Misty quickly informed him that Bug-type Pokémon are weak against Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeotto. After Pidgeotto dealt significant damage to Ash`s Caterpie, Ash recalled it and sent out Pikachu. Pikachu was able to use its Thundershock to weaken Pidgeotto and allow Ash to capture it with a PokéBall. Thus, this capture marked Ash`s second capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Pidgeotto the third Pokémon to join his team.
Later on, while still in the Viridian Forest, Ash was approached by Team Rocket, who attempted to steal his Pokémon. After defeating Meowth, James`s Koffing, and Jessie`s Ekans, Ash`s Caterpie evolved into Ash`s Metapod.
Some of Ash`s greatest accomplishments have been at the various Pokémon Leagues. He was the victor at the Orange League and the Battle Frontier. He also competed in the Indigo League and the Johto Silver Conference where he placed admirably in both those competitions as well.
Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup
Ash participated in the Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup at the Kagome Town stadium. In the first round he was in the fifth match and faced off against Marris. The match was quickly showcased and Ash won the battle and advanced to the second round while Marris was eliminated from the tournament.
The Isshu League
Ash participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where he was matched up against Trip. Trip`s Serperior was sent out to battle Pikachu and Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior`s speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter Trip`s Serperior speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round. The two met in the Pokémon Center after the battle, and Trip vowed that the next time they met that he would win. The two shook hands and parted ways.
In the first main round, Ash`s opponent was shown on the match up electronic board but not much else is known about the battle. Ash`s Scraggy participated in the second main round of the Isshu League tournament where it faced off against a Darumakka. It was able to defeat it so that moved on to the next round.
In the third round, Stephan was matched up against Ash. Cilan noted that the two of them have a very direct taste and that it would be a good battle. It was only a 3 on 3 battle but the both of them gave it their all. The first two battles of the third round setup the final match up of Stephan`s Sawk vs Ash`s Krookodile, both of which were very injured from the previous battles. Both of them did their best to muster up their reserve strength but in the end a surprise move of Aerial Ace by Ash`s Krookodile was super effective against Stephan`s Sawk and it knocked it out to give Ash the victory while eliminating Stephan from the tournament. Stephan realized after the battle that the reason that Ash withdrew Waruvial after the first battle was because Ash knew that Stephan would definitely send out Dageki, so he didn`t reveal that it knew Aerial Ace and saved until the end.</description>

<description>The Beginning
On the morning that Ash was to start his Pokémon journey, he woke up late and by the time he reached Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory, all of the beginner Pokémon were already taken. However, Professor Samual Oak did have one Pokémon left, a wild Pikachu. At first, Pikachu did not like Ash and would refuse to enter his PokéBall. He would often laugh at Ash`s failures and refused to listen to him. However, after Ash proved his loyalty to Pikachu by protecting him from a flock of Spearow, and thus began to earn Pikachu`s trust and respect. The two have since become best friends and Pikachu never leaves Ash`s side.
Since the day Team Rocket first encountered Pikachu, it has been their sole goal to capture it. Day after day, their plan to capture Pikachu has been thwarted mainly due to Pikachu`s amazingly powerful Thunderbolt that keeps on blasting them off.
On numerous occasions, Pikachu has made it evident that he is happy being a Pikachu and has no desire to evolve into a more powerful Raichu. It has proven time and time again that it is a powerful and worthy opponent to any Pokémon that dares to battle it.
Gym Battle against Burgh`s Leavanny
Pikachu was then sent out to battle Burgh`s Leavanny. Burgh`s Leavanny managed to tie up Pikachu with String Shot but unlike Ash`s Swadloon who was able to break free, Pikachu ended up getting hit with a couple of Leaf Storm attacks and a Hyper Beam before it rolled into another of Burgh`s Leavanny`s Leaf Storm attacks to break the string off its body so it could attack. Freed from the String Shot, Burgh`s Leavanny tried to tie it up again but Pikachu managed to avoid it with its speed and then knocked Burgh`s Leavanny out with a combination of Iron Tail and Electro Ball.
Gym Battle against Elesa
Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy and was then matched up with Pikachu. Pikachu made quick work of Elesa`s Emolga and knocked it out with one attack, its Iron Tail.
Elesa`s Tynamo was the last Pokémon that she used in her gym battle against Ash. It was matched up against Pikachu who had just defeated her Emonga. Pikachu had a hard time defending against the fast Tackle attack that Elesa`s Tynamo kept hitting it with but Pikachu used its Thunderbolt to create a large dust cloud leaving only a small corridor for Pikachu to focus on it and so Elesa`s Tynamo couldn`t maneuver out of the way. Pikachu one hit K.O`d Elesa`s Tynamo with a Iron Tail. The loss gave Ash the overall victory.
Battle against Alder`s Bouffalant
Ash challenged Alder to a battle and he accepted though he had been walking all night and was actually quite tired. Alder sent out his Buffron to battle Pikachu but just as the battle started, Alder fell asleep standing up and didn`t give any orders to his Buffron. Alder`s Bouffalant stood still as Pikachu began hitting it with attack after attack until it Alder`s Bouffalant finally got mad at Alder and charged at him and set him flying into a tree. After that, Alder`s Bouffalant no longer wished to battle and Alder conceded the battle.
Gym Battle against Skyla
In Skyla air battle simulation, Ash`s Tranquill was matched up against Skyla`s Unfezant and since her Pokémon was the highest evolved form, she determined that her Pokémon would be the winner in that match-up. In the actual gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was up against Skyla`s Unfezant which was the match-up just after Ash`s Tranquill had defeated Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla`s Unfezant proved to be stronger and faster than Ash`s Tranquill, so Ash recalled it and set out Pikachu. Pikachu had a definite advantage over Skyla`s Unfezant with its electric attacks and it quickly knocked it out with its Electro Ball attack.
Ash Just after Pikachu ended up knocking out Skyla`s Unfezant, Skyla`s Swanna was sent out to battle against it. Skyla had been watching her grandpa`s battle videos and noticed that he used the move Aqua Ring to defend against Electric attacks. She used that same defense against Pikachu which nullified its Electric attacks. It`s Iron Tail also couldn`t hit it so high in the air. Ash then noticed the rings in the air and Pikachu jumped up on them and managed to hit Skyla`s Swanna but not directly. Pikachu was now up in the air though and Skyla`s Swanna had the advantage there and it quickly knocked Pikachu out with a powerful Brave Bird attack.
Battle Against Trip`s Serperior at the Isshu League
Pikachu participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where it is was matched up against Trip`s Serperior. Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter its speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round.</description>

<description>Butch and Cassidy attached Drowzee to a device that would amplify Drowzee`s hypnotic waves and broadcasts it through a parabolic antenna on the roof of their base. Drowzee would then use the attack to round up Pokémon by telling them to come to Butch and Cassidy`s base on Mandarin Island. Drowzee could also command the controlled Pokémon to attack, regardless if it was their owner that they were attacking.
It`s control over the Pokémon was stopped when Pikachu`s Thunderbolt destroyed the control device. After Misty`s Togepi`s Metronome destroyed Butch and Cassidy`s base, Drowzee has not been seen since.</description>

<description>While Wobbuffet is technically Jessie`s Pokémon, it has been around so long that it has become a main character, appearing in almost every episode of the series since it debut.
Wobbuffet was first seen walking around with Benny, his previous trainer. Jessie traded her Lickitung for Wobbuffet and it has been with her ever since that day.
Wobbuffet rarely battles but when he does, his Counter and Mirror Coat moves have proved to be very effective. Unfortunately, Jessie`s tactics aren`t always sufficient to master Wobbuffet`s superior defensive skills.
Wobbuffet also randomly comes out of his Pokeball, especially during the Team Rocket motto. He is also seen blasting off with Jessie regardless if he was actually part of the action.</description>

<description>He is a Pokémon researcher that was once a competitive Trainer, and is generally considered the best in his field. As such, his role in the Pokémon games and anime is that of a mentor to young Pokémon Trainers, a source of information and an occasional plot device. Amongst other things, he is credited with inventing the Pokédex. He also hands out a Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander to beginning trainers (depending on which Pokémon the trainer chooses) to start their adventure in the Kanto Region. Although he is an expert on all matters relating to Pokémon, Professor Oak specializes in Pokémon behavioural science. He appears in Pokémon 4Ever as a child who was pulled into the future by Celebi. Additionally, it is apparent after Pokémon 3: The Movie that he knew Delia Ketchum since she was a child; this most likely is the reason he occasionally exhibits parental-type concern (mainly in the form of scolding Ash as he is doing something that is dangerous). He also creates poems centred around Pokémon and is known as the rhyming professor by Dawn.</description>

<description>Brock said that Ash`s Pidgeotto would stand up to any kind of attack if it was to protect Ash from harm.
While walking through a forest near Pallet Town, Ash realizes the Spearow that he hit with his Pokeball on the first day that he was on his journey must have evolved into a Fearow. A bunch of Pidgey and Pidgeotto were stuck in a tree and were too afraid to leave it. Ash`s Pidgeotto helped them be brave enough to leave but just as they did the Fearow attacked Ash`s Pidgeotto and injured it. Realizing that the Pidgey and Pidgeotto were still in trouble, Ash`s Pidgeotto evolved into a Pidgeot.
Kanto Pokémon League
Just before Ash`s fifth round battle against Ritchie, Jessie had tricked Ash into leaving the arena by impersonating Ritchie. Jessie, James and Meowth all delayed from reaching the arena and Pidgeotto had to use all of its energy in helping Ash get to the arena before he was disqualified. Unfortunately, due to the amount of energy Pidgeotto had used up, Ash decided not to use it in the fifth round.</description>

<description>Ash caught 30 Tauros while at the Kanto Safari Zone
Orange League Final - Vs. Ash Ketchum (Rocky Field)
Ash chooses Tauros as his third Pokémon to go against Drake`s Gengar.
Ash tells Tauros to begin with Fissure but Gengar jumps into the air and avoids the attack. Whilst in the air Gengar uses Confuse Ray which makes Tauros attack the nearby rock and damage itself in the process. Ash quickly recalls Tauros and sends out Lapras in the water pool in the middle of the stage.
Lapras and Gengar battled each other and ended up eliminating each other when their attacks collided.
With Drake losing his third Pokémon there was a short interval whilst the battle field change into a sandy field.
Orange League Final - Vs. Ash Ketchum (Sand Field)
The interval ended and Drake began by choosing Venusaur whilst Ash brought Tauros back into the battle who had now recovered from Gengar`s Confuse Ray. Ash`s first move was to have Tauros stamp its feet to use Fissure, however, the soft sand absorbed the move. Drake took advantage of the situation by having Venusaur use Solarbeam but knowing Solarbeam takes a while to charge up, Ash have Tauros charge straight towards Drake`s Venusaur and flip it into the air just before it fired. Venusaur managed to adjust itself mid-air and fire the Solarbeam at Tauros. The impact was close to Tauros and knocked it down but it managed to recover and get back to its feet quickly.
Venusaur struck Tauros with one of its Vine Whip attacks but Tauros manage to avoid any further strikes and successfully land a Take Down move on Venusaur and eliminate it from the battle.
Drake sent out Electabuzz and Ash decided to give Tauros another rest and switched in Bulbasaur.
Tauros was switched in again after Ash recalled the eliminated Squirtle. Tauros charged into the middle of the field whilst Dragonite flew up and use Body Slam. To Drake`s surprise Ash told Tauros to stand its ground and endure the hit, which it does so successfully and even manages to throw Dragonite to the floor using its horns.
Dragonite get up and uses Thunderbolt which proves too much for Tauros and eliminates it from the battle leaving Ash with one Pokémon left.
After Ash had won the battle against Drake he called out all of his Pokémon that participated in the battle on the stage as Drake presented him with the Winner`s Trophy. Then Ash, Pikachu, Tauros, Lapras, Squirtle, Bulbasaur and Charizard all had their handprints set in stone to be remembered in the Orange Island Hall of Fame.</description>

Kanto Pokémon League Tournament
Round 4 - Vs Ash Ketchum - Grass Field
Despite looking like a weak opponent Jeanette`s Bellsprout managed to KO both Ash`s Bulbasaur and his Pikachu. Ash turned to Muk who he transferred from Prof. Oak just before the battle.
Due to Muk`s slow speed and bigger size it could not avoid Bellsprouts attack but thanks to its slimy and elastic body it was simply able to absorb them and not feel any damage. Bellsprout continued to launch a number of ounches, kicks and throws but still Muk absorbed them all. After repelling a Razor Leaf attack Muk smothered Bellsprout with its body and after a few seconds of struggling Bellsprout was defeated, giving Ash the victory and earned him a place in the final 16.
Please with its victory it gave Ash a hug which forced Ash to the ground. Ash laughed and praised Muk for giving him the victory.</description>

<description>While traveling through Viridian Forest, Ash was approached by Samurai, who was looking for the next trainer from Pallet Town. Samurai challenged Ash to a Pokémon battle, causing Ash to forget about the wild Weedle he was trying to capture, which then escaped. The battle started off with Samurai`s Pinsir going up against Ash`s Pidgeotto, who was already tired from the battle it just had with the wild Weedle. Samurai`s Pinsir quickly defeated Ash`s Pidgeotto, forcing Ash to call on Ash`s Metapod. Ash`s Metapod`s Harden raised its defense enough so that Samurai`s Pinsir`s horns had no effect on it. Samurai then recalled Samurai`s Pinsir and sent out Samurai`s Metapod. The two Pokémon were locked in a stalemate using the same Harden attack over and over again. However, the battle was forced into a draw when a swarm of wild Beedrill approached and flew off with Ash`s Metapod.
In hot pursuit by the Beedrill, the group ran off and headed for Samurai`s cabin. Once there, Samurai revealed that he had previously battled and lost to Gary Oak and the other two trainers from Pallet Town. Samurai told Ash that he was a joke of a trainer compared to the previous trainers that had come from Pallet. He then called Ash a bad trainer for leaving Ash`s Metapod outside with the Beedrill. The next day, Ash was able to retrieve Ash`s Metapod, which evolved into Ash`s Butterfree. Ash was then able to earn the respect of Samurai after he defeated the swarm of Beedrill with his new Pokémon.</description>

<description>Misty`s Staryu is one of the powerhouses on her water Pokémon based team and has seen action in numerous battles. This is one of her three original team members which also had Misty`s Goldeen and Misty`s Starmie, its final evolved form. The attacks it was commonly seen using were Water Gun and occasionally Rapid Spin.
Misty`s Staryu`s personality is largely a mystery due to the fact that it has no face and thus no facial expressions but has proven its self to be very dependable time and time again.</description>

<description>Kanto Pokémon League Tournament
Round 4 - Vs Jeanette Fisher - Grass Field
Ash selected Bulbasaur as his first Pokémon whilst Jeanette choose her Beedrill. As the faster Pokémon, Beedrill charged at bulbasaur at full speed, however Bulbasaur mananged to evade and return a Razor Leaf attack. Once again Beedrill used its superior speed, avoiding the Razor Leaf attack whilst also getting itself in a good position to use a Twin Needle atttack on Bulbasaur. Despite being on the backfoot, Bulbasaur managed to dodge the Twin Needle attack and Beedrill`s Stinger. After jumping backwards, Bulbasaur created enough space to be able to use its Leech Seed attack which struck Beedrill on its attacking stinger. Beedril was stuck in Leech Seed forcing it to the floor and Ash had bulbasaur finish it off using a Tackle attack which gave Ash the Initial Advantage in the battle.
Like Beedrill, Scyther had an advantage in speed and used this by quickly trying to attack Bulbasaur with its blades. After beeing unsuccessful, Jeanette order Scyther to used a Swift attack which managed to hit Bulbasaur a few times and was useful in deflecting its Vine Whip attack. Jeanette ordered Scyther to use a Double Team attack to which Ash had Bulbasaur to attempt to hit the real Scyther. The attempt failed and Scyther was able to land a few strikes by charging at Bulbasaur and managed to evade Bulbasaur`s counter of a Razor Leaf and Vine Whip attack. Ash had Bulbasaur use its Vine Whip once more but told it to swing the vines towards all of the copies which Double Team created, knowing that Bulbasaur would have to hit the real one in the process. The plan worked and Scyther was struck by Vine Whip, eliminating it from the battle.
Jeanette released her final Pokémon of the round which was a Bellsprout. Her choice suprised her a few people including Bulbasaur, as by apperance alone Bellsprout could be considered a weak Pokémon.
Ash had Bulbasaur charge at Bellsprout but managed to flip it above its head using its own momentum against itself. Ash was stunned by Bellsprout`s agility. Bulbasaur was angered at being tossed aside so easily and charged once again at Bellsprout, but like before, was thrown away using its own momentum. Bellsprout took advantage of Bulbasaur being on the floor and thrown it towards Ash`s podium, showing great strength and eliminated Bulbasaur from the tie.
Ash quickly rushed Pikachu into battle to try and finish Bellsprout off.

Ash`s second battle took place on the Rock Field and the battle went down to Ash`s and his opponent`s final Pokémon, which consisted of Ash`s Squirtle and his opponent`s Nidorino.
Ash played defensive as he order Squirtle to withdraw into its shell just before Nidorino charged at it and sent it rolling accross the field. Whilst still rolling, Squirtle used a rock as a ramp and was launched into the air which gave Ash the chance to order Squirtle to shoot a water gun at Nidorino. Nidorino was slammed into a rock from the force of the water gun which gave Squirtle the opportunity to land a Skull Bash which gave Ash his second victory of the tournament.
Just before the fifth round battle Ash needed Squirtle`s help whilst they fended off Jessie, James and Meowth whilst attempting to get to the stadium on time. This meant Squirtle was slightly tired before the battle.

Squirtle headed towards the water pool in the middle of the arena but Onix emerged just before it reached it and then managed to trap Squirtle in Wrap.
Squirtle struggled to get free but the Wrap was too strong, however, Ash managed to get Squirtle to use Hydro Pump which managed to strike Onix and release Squirtle from the Wrap attack. Squirtle used Skull Bash on the Onix and eliminated Drake`s second Pokémon in the battle.
Drake choose Gengar as his third Pokémon and Ash swtiched in Tauros for Squirtle.

After Ash had won the battle against Drake he called out all of his Pokémon that participated in the battle on the stage as Drake presented him with the Winner`s Trophy. Then Ash, Pikachu, Tauros, Lapras, Squirtle, Bulbasaur and Charizard all had their handprints set in stone to be remembered in the Orange Island Hall of Fame.</description>

While at the lighthouse, he was waiting for just one Pokémon to show up. One day, he could hear a voice from across the sea so he created a similar sound and sent it across the sea from this lighthouse. That same Pokémon arrived the day Ash and his friends were there but was scared off by Team Rocket. He wasn`t exactly sure what Pokémon it was, but it made his determination to study Pokémon even greater.</description>

<description>Charizard evolves from Charmeleon during a battle with Aerodactyl but still remains disobient to Ash.
Kanto Pokémon League:
Fifth Round - Vs Ritchie.
Ash gambled on using a disobient Charizard and he was trailing in the battle and his other Pokémon were tired.
Charizard originally appeared like it was not going to do anything but after Ritchie`s Charmander narrowly missed with a flamethrower, Charizard decided to fight back with a flamethrower of its own with panicked Charmander and forced Ritchie to recall it.
Pikachu was Ritchie`s third and final Pokémon in the battle and was against Ash`s Charizard which had just forced Charmander to be switched. Charizard trembled the ground with a couple of stomps making Pikachu lose its balance and then blew Pikachu away using a gust from its wings. Seemingly thinking Pikachu was not a worthy opponent, Charizard took a nap in the middle of a battle and despite Ash pleaded with it to battle, it was eliminated. This gave Sparky the victory over Charizard and put Ritchie into round six.
Ash angrily recalled Charizard into its ball.
Orange Islands.
Ash called upon Charizard to battle Tad`s Poliwrath which had a reputation of being a very strong Pokémon. Charizard refused to listen to Ash`s orders and Poliwrath shoots a water gun on Charizards tail making the flame much smaller, then a subsuquent Ice Beam hits Charizard and freezes it. The battle left Charizard very injured and Ash had to keep its tail flame alive much like he did when he first found it as a Charmander.
Despite an intial struggle, Charizard saw how much Ash cared for him and once it reached full health in the morning Charizard became friendly with Ash and even obeyed Ash during Battle.
Charizard then went on to defeat Tad`s Poliwrath in a re-match.
Orange League Final - Vs. Ash Ketchum (Sand Field)
Ash chose Charizard to battle against Electabuzz and ordered it to use Flamethrower against Electabuzz, who quickly jumped into the air and landed a Thunderpunch onto Charizard and follwowed up by shocking Charizard with an electric attack. Charizard managed to release himself from the electricity by firing a Fire Spin and then Charizard flew towards Electabuzz quickly making sure it could not use it Thunderbolt attack. Charizard got a good grip on Electabuzz and flew into the air and used Seismic Toss on it which eliminated it and left Drake with one Pokémon left.
Drake`s final Pokémon was his prized Dragonite who he sent out to battle Ash`s Charizard.
Charizard moved first by using a Flamethrower attack but Dragonite countered by using Water Gun which cuts through the Flamethrower and hits Charizard, who then takes to the skies whilst avoiding Dragonite`s Ice Beam.
Dragonite then takes to the sky itself showing great speed as it does so. Dragonite and Charizard exchange Ice Beam and Flamethrower attacks respectively but it is Dragonite who manages to clip Charizard wing using Ice Beam which send Charizard spinning to the ground. Charizard recovers and flies close to Dragonite in an attempt to use a Seismic Toss attack, however, Dragonite avoids and gets a good grip on Charizard which gives it the opportunity to use a Slam attack.
Charizard gets up quick although it is clearly tired but it has enough stength to launch a Dragon Rage attack. Dragonite uses the same move, the attacks collide and both Pokémon are sent flying backwards. When the dust settles both Pokémon are standing but exhausted from the previous battle, after a few deep breaths Charizard falls to the ground and is eliminated.
After Ash had won the battle against Drake he called out all of his Pokémon that participated in the battle on the stage as Drake presented him with the Winner`s Trophy. Then Ash, Pikachu, Tauros, Lapras, Squirtle, Bulbasaur and Charizard all had their handprints set in stone to be remembered in the Orange Island Hall of Fame.</description>

<description>In a forest near Pallet Town, a bunch of Pidgey and Pidgeotto were being terrorized by a Fearow and Spearow. Realizing that the Pidgey and Pidgeotto were in trouble, Ash`s Pidgeotto evolved into a Pidgeot. Ash and Pikachu climbed on Pidgeot and were able to battle with it to scare off the Fearow and Spearow.
Pidgeot was released so that it could watch over the Pidgey and Pidgeotto so that the Fearow didn`t try to attack them again. Ash told Pidgeot that he would be back as soon as he got the Poke Ball for Professor Oak but they have yet to reunite.</description>

<description>Kanto Pokémon League - Round One (Water Field) - Vs Mandi
Ash`s Krabby evolved into a Kingler after defeating an Exeggutor during a battle against Mandi.
Mandi sent out a Seadra in an attempt in regain the advantage in the battle in the water field and ordered it to charge at Kingler. Ash`s response was to have Kingler use Water-Gun on Seadra but failed to land a hit. Kingler switched its attacks to Bubble and managed to send the Seadra skywards. Ash had Kingler do a crabhammer attack and managed to score Kingler`s second victory of the battle, its first as a Kingler.
Ash once again stuck with Kingler as Mandi send Golbat out to try and make a comeback. Kingler found itself at a disadvantage as it struggled to cope with Golbats speed and found that Golbat could avoid its Vicegrip attempt with ease. Kingler was knocked onto one of the platforms just above the water level and as Golbat attempted to get close for a Mega-Drain attack it managed to counter with Hyper-Beam which gave Kingler his third victory and put Ash into the second round of the Competition.
After the battle a clearly delighted Ash thanked Kingler for providing him with his first ever win in a Pokémon League tournament.
Kanto Pokémon League - Round Third (Ice Field) - Vs Pete Pebbleman
After both Ash and Pete has lost a Pokémon the battle was now down to Ash`s Kingler and Pete`s Cloyster. Both Pokémon approached each other slowly before Ash order Kingler use its crabhammer attack to which Pete told his Cloyster to withdraw into its shell. Despite seemingly causing little damage, Kingler persisted in hitting the withdrawn Cloyster with Pete unable to find a way to counter. Kingler kept up the barrage of attacks even though it was starting to tire out and eventually it paid off as Kingler cracked Cloyster`s shell, KO`ing it in the process. This victory gave Ash the advantage in the third round and Pete attempted to make a comeback by using an Arcanine.
Pete`s choice of Pokémon came to a suprise to some people as the battle was taking place on the ice field.
Knowing about Arcanine`s type disadvantage to Kingler, Ash confidently ordered Kingler to use a Bubble attack, however, Arcanines speed on the icy terrain was quick and manage to dodge Kingler`s attack.
Arcanine had managed to find some space on the battlefield and launched a Dragon Rage attack which swept Kingler off its feet and into some ice. A dazed Kingler attempted to get to its feet but Ash decided to switch to Pikachu.
Pikachu managed to defeat Arcanine which gave Ash and his Pokémon the victory in the third round.</description>

<description>Orange League Final - Vs. Ash Ketchum (Rocky Field)
After Gengar confused Tauros Ash quickly recalls Tauros and sends out Lapras in the water pool in the middle of the stage.
Lapras goes underwater to dodge Gengar`s initial attack and then resurfaced to shoot a water gun directly at Gengar who only manage to get out of the way after taking some damage. Gengar shoots Night Shade at Lapras who counter attacks with Ice Beam, the two attacks collide with each other and the resulting explosion eliminate both Pokémon which meant Drake has lost three Pokémon and Ash had only lost one.
After Ash had won the battle against Drake he called out all of his Pokémon that participated in the battle on the stage as Drake presented him with the Winner`s Trophy.

<description>In a forest outside of New Bark Town, Ash solved a territory dispute between the local Heracross and Pinsir. Afterwards one of the Heracross who grew fond of Ash and his Bulbasaur decided to accompany him on his Johto journey.

Heracross was eventually recalled and it competed with Ash as his trainer in the Silver Conference but remained at Oak`s Laboratory when Ash departed for the Hoenn region.
It is a strong, loyal yet slightly docile Pokémon whose feats of strength include lifting a big mechanical Pinsir and defeating Gary Oak`s Magmar at the Silver Conference despite a type disadvantage.</description>

Nastina owned the Beach House Obaba which was located on the beach of Aopulco. She lent money to Moe to help his business. When Ash and his friends arrived, Moe had till the next day to pay back the money to Brutella. She didn`t care if he went bankrupt as that would lower her competition for customers.
Team Rocket worked for Brutella to get some money for their mecha repairs but a missle from their submarine severely damaged the Beach House Obaba, leaving Brutella to deal with the mess.</description>

<description>Nastina is the cousin of Brutella. Nastina often gets confused for her cousin and she gets upset when people confuser her. She has a very grouchy personality and she doesn`t get along very well with people.
Nastina was creating a grand resort area called Paradise Obaba which she was the president of. She thought that her resort would be better than the resort that Brutella was making in Aopulco because inside the main structure is a suite room surrounded by the world`s most beautiful coral reef but a bunch of disruptive Menokurage kept getting in the way of construction and all the tourists were going to Aopulco. She had a standing reward of 1,000,000 yen, a year`s worth of hotel stays and fine dinners around the world for a year for the person that could get rid of the Menokurage.
Ash and his friends found out that the resort was being built on the coral reef where the Menokurage lived and that`s why they were upset. The resort ended up being destroyed and Nastina was sent flying all the way to Aopulco where she landed right beside her cousin Brutella who was rebuilding.</description>

<description>Erika is the Gym Leader of Celadon Gym located in the heart of Celadon City. Trainers that defeat her in a gym battle are awarded the Rainbow Badge as proof of defeating her. She specializes in Grass-type Pokémon as well as selling and making perfumes.
As well as running her gym, she also runs a perfume store nearby where she is the manager. Erika believes that perfume has the effects of relaxing people`s moods, invigorating them and healing their hearts. When Ash entered her perfume store and mocked it as just a means of making guys fawn over girls, he was kicked out of the store and then later out of the Celadon Gym as well. She instructed her subordinates to not allow him to enter the gym because of his perfume remarks.
Essence of Gloom
Team Rocket heard about a legendary perfume that is made in the Celadon Gym and attempted to steal it. They tricked Ash into working with them so they could enter the gym undetected. They ended up destroying the Celadon Gym in a large fire before they stole what they thought was the formula but instead it was Gloom extract which is used as raw material for perfume.
Gym Battle with Ash
Since Ash was banned from the gym, he couldn`t challenge Erika to a battle. He snuck in disguised as a girl and called himself `Ashley` (Sato-chan). Pikachu realized it was him and since he was discovered he challenged Erika to a battle on the spot which she accepted. She setup the battle as a 3-on-3 but the battle was never fully completed. Her Tangela was sent out first and it managed to defeat Ash`s Bulbasaur with a Stun Spore, which paralyzed it. Realizing that his Grass on Grass battle technique wasn`t working against Erika, Ash sent out his Charmander. Erika then told Ash she`d give him a Paralyze Heal after the battle which showed her loving and compassionate side. Erika`s Weepinbell was sent out second to counter Ash`s Charmander but its Flamethrower proved to be too much for it.
In the final matchup, Erika`s Gloom was sent out to battle Ash`s Charmander and Ash`s Charmander couldn`t stand the horrid smell of Erika`s Gloom and was recalled. Pikachu was going to be matched up with it for the final round of the battle but Team Rocket exploded a bomb in the gym and it caught fire. Everyone except Erika`s Gloom escaped safely, so Ash decided to go in after it as he thought he was partially responsible for the disaster. As thanks for rescuing her Gloom, Erika gave Ash the Rainbow Badge.</description>

The construction worker decided that he should call for any able Pokémon trainer who is traveling through the area to help him get rid of the Diglett. He offered a reward of a 6-night, 7-day stay at the famous Giva Hot Springs Resort for the trainer that dealt with the Diglett situation.
After realizing that the Diglett were just protecting their home, he decided to call off the dam construction project so that it wouldn`t flood the Diglett and Dugtrio`s home.</description>

<description>The father of Tarou.
Five years ago, when Tarou was three years old, he took his family on a trip around the world. As they were flying a helicopter over the Safari Land, he held Tarou out of the window to give him a closer view at the Pokémon below, but ended up dropping him. Ever since, he and his wife had been searching for Tarou without luck, until someone sent them a photo of a boy resembling Tarou living with a herd of Kangaskhan in the Safari Land Pokémon reserve. Along with his wife, he traveled to the Safari Land to retrieve his son, and enlisted the help of the ranger Officer Jenny and Ash Ketchum. They soon discovered Tarou, but he had already forgotten his birth parents and lived as a part of the Kangaskhan herd. While Tarou eventually regained the memory if his parents, he was too connected to his adoptive Kangaskhan family to want to go home with them. Soon afterwards, Tarou, Ash Ketchum and the others were attacked by Team Rocket, who attempted to poach Kangaskhan using a giant Kangaskhan robot, and together with his wife, he sacrificed himself by running their helicopter straight into the robot, blowing it up and seemingly killing him and his wife. He survived the crash, however, and he and his wife eventually emerged from the wreck dressed in leopard skins, saying that since Tarou didn`t want to move away from his Kangaskhan family, they would live in the Safari Land with him from now on.</description>

<description>Duplica introduced herself as from the House of Imitay which is known for imitating. Duplica likes to dress up and change into costumes so she can imitate people like Officer Jenny and Nurse Joy. Duplica explained to Ash and his friends that she wants to become the greatest Ditto Master and a big star, not a Pokémon Master like Ash. Duplica is known for her perky and curious personality. She also has a large wardrobe of clothes that she uses as costumes so she can transform her looks.
When Ash and his friends first met Duplica, she was training her Ditto which was having problems transforming perfectly. Her Imitehouse theater wasn`t getting any patrons because they didn`t want to see a Ditto that couldn`t transform perfectly. Team Rocket appeared and stole Duplica`s Ditto and tried to get it to transform. It wasn`t until Meowth threatened to use its claw on Duplica`s Ditto that it finally was able to transform properly. Duplica`s Ditto tried to transform again and was able to transform perfectly from that point on. Duplica was very grateful and thanked Team Rocket for getting her Ditto to transform perfectly.
Duplica reopened the Imitehouse theater after her Ditto could transform perfectly in the hopes that passing travelers would visit and watch her act with her Ditto.</description>

<description>Ash and his friends first encountered Duplica`s Ditto when they ran into Imitehouse to get out of the rain. Ash`s attention quickly turned to a `Pikachu` noise behind him and he was surprised to see another Pikachu beside his own Pikachu. Misty thought the `Pikachu` was cute and she picked it only to be surprised by its odd looking face. Misty quickly dropped Duplica`s Ditto as she didn`t know what`s wrong with the Pikachu. Brock`s first reaction was that it was new kind of Pikachu after he examined it and Ash tried to capture it but Duplica stopped him by throwing a Poke ball at his Poke ball.

Duplica`s Ditto can also transform into objects, not just Pokémon. It has been seen transforming into a book, a picture and a canon.</description>

<description>The Hippie is a calm, old man who plays the PokéFlute. In exchange for his concerts, he expects visitors to repay him with some food. However, usually his visitors pass on by without giving him anything.
The Hippie has befriended a Snorlax that eats and sleeps. If the Snorlax is causing trouble (blocking something important), it can easily be awaken with the use of the PokéFlute. In the episode "Wake Up Snorlax!" a Snorlax was blocking a town`s water supply, causing crops to dry out and food to be scarce. The old Hippie used his PokéFlute to solve the problem.
The Hippie also has a job of waking up many Snorlax. He owns a device that tells him when a Snorlax needs to be awaken.</description>

<description>Professor Felina Ivy is a good friend of Professor Oak. She lives on Valencia Island where she has a a house that also functions as her laboratory and large forest where she studies and breeds Pokémon.
She has three lab assistants: Charity, Hope, and Faith who help her with her research.
Until Brock arrived, Ivy was too wrapped up in her Pokémon research to keep her house tidy and she and her assistants nicknamed their house "Our Little Dump". Her table manners are also a bit lacking as she tends to eat fast and sloppily.
She is currently collecting data and studying "How Environment Causes Variation in all our Pokémon". She has breed all the Pokémon on the island to help with her research. She is very protective of the Pokémon there and she helped rescue a Radicate without worrying about her safety.
Ash Ketchum was sent by Professor Oak to pickup the GS Ball from her lab because Professor Ivy and her assistants were unable to open it and she hoped Professor Oak would have better luck figuring it out.
She has written a preliminary report in Pokémon Researchers Monthly on "Pokémon Adaptive Variation as a Function or Regional Distribution". Professor Oak told Professor Ivy that he found it quite persuasive.</description>

<description>Ash and his friends first encountered Cissy`s Brother near the Mikan Island Gym. He put a coconut on the ground and as Ash picked it up, he dumped water on him. He has quite a snarky attitude as he made fun of Ash for falling for his trick and told him couldn`t be a very good trainer.
Cissy`s Brother challenged Ash to a battle but just as they were about to start, revealing that he owns a Pokémon but Cissy`s Brother`s older sister Cissy appeared and wondered if he was causing trouble as he was supposed to be inside cleaning his room. He tried to defend himself by lying to his sister saying he caught Ash sneaking around but Ash quickly defended the accusation.
Cissy`s Brother helps his sister out during the gym battles by using the gyms remote control to activate certain parts of the gym as they are needed. He also started the Pokémon Wave Ride race with a starter gun and cheered his sister on during the race.</description>

<description>Cissy`s Seadra was the first Pokémon that Cissy revealed to Ash for their gym match. Ash pulled out his dex and it stated that Seadra`s were known for their horrible disposition but they posesses both strength and speed. After hearing the dex entry, Ash quickly commented that Cissy`s Seadra wasn`t going to win any beauty contests either. Cissy`s Seadra didn`t take Ash`s comment very well and hit him with a Water Gun attack in the face.
During the Water Gun accuracy challenge, Tracey was impressed how accurate is was by being able to hit all the stationary cans and the moving ones as well. The match ended up in a draw though as both Cissy`s Seadra and Ash`s Squirtle both hit the final target at the same time.</description>

<description>Cissy sent out her Blastoise at the beginning of her second challenge, the Pokémon Wave Ride race but just as she did Team Rocket appeared and captured it in their net. Cissy`s Blastoise proved to be too strong for Team Rocket though as it broke out of their net and then used Hydro Pump to send them blasting off again.
Blastoise proved that it was also a fast swimmer and a strong Pokémon during the Pokémon Wave Ride race against Ash`s Lapras. It bashed Ash`s Lapras quite a few times but it wasn`t able to completely stop it. It managed to make it around the flag first but on the home stretch Ash`s Lapras managed to use an Ice Beam to freeze the water so it could go faster and win the race. Cissy`s Blastoise barely lost though as Ash`s Lapras won by half a stroke.</description>

Gastly wasn`t affected like the other Pokémon by Team Rocket`s Hypnotic waves because Ghost Pokémon are strong against psychic type attacks. Gastly found both Jessie and James lying in the street unconscious after Butch and Cassidy kicked them out of their base. Gastly played an important role in defeating Team Rocket by stopping the combined attack of all the controlled Pokémon from hitting Ash and the others. It then broke down the front gate to allow the captured Pokémon to escape the base.</description>

Realizing that her brother needed the inspiration that her Grandpa once got from seeing the Crystal Onix, she decided to send out a message in a bottle to see if people would be able to help her and Mateo find it.
The letter she wrote stated: "If you know anything about a Pokémon called the Crystal Onix, let me know right away." Ash and his friends found the bottle near Sunburst Island and then decided to help her find the Crystal Onix as Ash said it wasn`t polite to let a letter from a little girl go unanswered.
Marissa went along with everyone as they searched the Sunburst Island for the Crystal Onix. She was a bit scared when they initially found it but was happy that she was able to see it. Marissa was very grateful to Ash and his friends for helping her and her brother find the Crystal Onix.</description>

<description>Mateo runs a glass and crystal shop on Sunburst lsland. His little sister Marissa lives with him and helps him run the shop. When Ash and his friends met him, he wasn`t feeling very well and didn`t want to make glass anymore which was hurting their business. The local shopkeepers were complaining about him because he was hurting their business by not stocking any merchandise which made their stores look bad.
Mateo explained that his creations just didn`t have the spark that his Grandpa`s Pokémon statues had as they always looked like they might come alive. Mateo said he just needed some kind of inspiration and he hoped that capturing the Crystal Onix would be that spark.
Mateo told Ash that he had looked for the Crystal Onix all over the island but he couldn`t find it anywhere. With the help of Tracey`s Marill, Mateo was able to find the Crystal Onix in a cave in a remote part of Sunburst Island. He battle it but after he knocked it out felt something strange for a minute when he looked at the Onix. He explained that the feeling was hard to describe but he gained the inspiration he need to start working again on his Pokémon statues. As thanks for helping him, Mateo made Ash a small figure of Pikachu.</description>

<description>Ash and Misty first heard about the Crystal Onix when they picked up a bottle in the ocean with a note in it written by Marissa asking anyone if they knew anything about the Crystal Onix to tell her. Tracey explains to Ash and Misty that it`s supposed to be an Onix made of glass crystal but he said he wasn`t sure it was real. Tracey states that there were people who said they`ve seen it but they were only rumors. Ash stated at the time he`d love to see the Crystal Onix and his wish came true when he saw it.
Team Rocket heard the rumor about the Crystal Onix from some local merchants and decided they would try to capture the rare Pokémon. The Crystal Onix just hit it with its tail and sent Team Rocket blasting off again.
The Crystal Onix lives on a remote part of Sunburst Island in a cave. When the tide goes down, a sandbar appears to let people get to that part of the island. It isn`t afraid of water like most normal Onix are and it often spends time in the underground lake in the cave. Mateo battled it and knocked it out but before he tried to capture it, he felt something strange for a minute when he looked at the Onix. Mateo explained that the feeling was hard to describe but he gained the inspiration he need to start working again on his Pokémon statues thanks to the Crystal Onix. The Crystal Onix then recovered and dove back into the water after Mateo thanked it.</description>

Tracey`s Marill has very sensitive ears that can detect distant sounds and the round, rubbery tip of its tail can expand and contract, assisting Marill in the water. While swimming, Tracey`s Marill tail floats so he can see where it`s going.
Misty realized that Tracey and his Marill make a good team as Tracey`s Marill could hear a Pokémon long before Tracey could even see it. Tracey would often play a Pokémon cry on his dex for Marill to help it learn what the Pokémon sounded like so it could search for that particular Pokémon. Tracey`s Marill ears would twitch when it was searching or it found something.</description>

<description>The Seaking at the Cerulean City Gym has only had one appearance in the anime but nonetheless, made a difference in The Misty Mermaid, the episode it appeared in. It was in an underwater ballet written by Violet, one of Misty`s three sisters.
At the beginning of the play it was seen among the Gym`s and Misty`s other Pokemon in the giant tank in which Gym battles and the ballet took place. It swam around Misty and danced until unfortunately, Team Rocket stole the show.
After Misty`s Horsea used a Smokescreen attack against Jessie`s Arbok in order to evade its Wrap attack, Seaking, without warning or command, came speeding through the thinning Smokescreen and used its Horn Attack on Jessie`s Arbok. After a brief moment, Misty ordered Seaking to use Horn Drill on Arbok. Along with Misty`s Starmie and Ash`s Squirtle, Seaking triple teams Jessie`s Arbok until Misty`s sisters` Seel finally evolves into Dewgong and saves the day, freezing, and eventually defeating Team Rocket. Seaking never makes an appearance after this and most likely remains at the Cerulean City gym.</description>

He is a strong believer in extraterrestrial life and has great interest in finding more proof to support his beliefs, as frequently demonstrated in this episode. However, he is a bit of a klutz and tends to let his interest and excitement get the best of him, as shown during his questioning of witnesses to Clefairy`s earth landing and of Clefairy`s superb technology aboard their spaceship. He ended up blasting off with the Clefairy in their spaceship and landing nearby on earth. Nothing is currently known about whether or not he is still studying the Clefairy.</description>

Another personality trait Mandi has is that he can be extremely arogant towards people and shown this when he refused to shake Ash`s hand before they battled, claiming that his hands are for holding Pokéballs only.
Mandi`s first round battle ended in defeated in a whitewash when Krabby evolved into Kingler just after it defeated Mandi`s Exeggutor. Kingler went on to defeat Mandi`s Seadra and Golbat.
The nature of the battle caused Mandi to lose his composure a couple of times and he was very disappointed when he was defeated.</description>

<description>Mandi`s Exeggutor is the Pokémon Mandi decided to use first against Ash in the first round of the Kanto Pokémon League.
Exeggutor was up against Ash`s Krabby and started off well as its Psybeam to force Krabby to jump into the water. Then, using its Psychic ability, Exeggutor created a whirlpool in the water, trapping Krabby inside. As Krabby struggled to get out of the whirlpool Exeggutor started to bombard the pool using its egg-bomb attack that made Ash attempt to switch Krabby out, although unsuccessful due to the whirlpool trapping Krabby inside.
A smug Mandi was caught off-guard when Krabby managed to compose itself, launch out of the water and used Vicegrip on Exeggutor`s leaf, clamping on hard as Exeggutor tried to shake it off. A quick leer attack, followed by a Stomp KO`ed Exeggutor and Krabby had won its first ever battle.
Mandi looked on as he watched Krabby evolve into Kingler but quickly regained his flair as he release his second Pokémon, a Seadra.</description>

Once Golbat had found some space it used a Wing Attack which slammed Kingler onto one of the platforms above water-level. Mandi order Golbat to use Mega-Drain but as Golbat got closer, Ash ordered Kingler to use Hyper-Beam, hitting Golbat head-on and eliminating Mandi from the competition in the first round.</description>

Kanto Pokémon League Tournament
Round 4 - Vs Ash Ketchum - Grass Field
Jeanette made a grand entrance to the grass field complete with a red carpet, flower petals and a cheering squad.
Ash selected Bulbasaur as his first Pokémon whilst Jeanette choose her Beedrill. As the faster Pokémon, Beedrill charged at bulbasaur at full speed, however Bulbasaur mananged to evade and return a Razor Leaf attack. Once again Beedrill used its superior speed, avoiding the Razor Leaf attack whilst also getting itself in a good position to use a Twin Needle atttack on Bulbasaur. Despite being on the backfoot, Bulbasaur managed to dodge the Twin Needle attack and Beedrill`s Stinger. After jumping backwards, Bulbasaur created enough space to be able to use its Leech Seed attack which struck Beedrill on its attacking stinger. Beedril was stuck in Leech Seed forcing it to the floor and Ash had bulbasaur finish it off using a Tackle attack which gave Ash the Initial Advantage in the battle.
Like Beedrill, Scyther had an advantage in speed and used this by quickly trying to attack Bulbasaur with its blades. After beeing unsuccessful, Jeanette order Scyther to used a Swift attack which managed to hit Bulbasaur a few times and was useful in deflecting its Vine Whip attack. Jeanette ordered Scyther to use a Double Team attack to which Ash had Bulbasaur to attempt to hit the real Scyther. The attempt failed and Scyther was able to land a few strikes by charging at Bulbasaur and managed to evade Bulbasaur`s counter of a Razor Leaf and Vine Whip attack. Ash had Bulbasaur use its Vine Whip once more but told it to swing the vines towards all of the copies which Double Team created, knowing that Bulbasaur would have to hit the real one in the process. The plan worked and Scyther was struck by Vine Whip, eliminating it from the battle.
Jeanette released her final Pokémon of the round which was a Bellsprout. Her choice suprised her a few people including her opponent, Ash, as by apperance alone Bellsprout could be considered a weak Pokémon.
Ash had Bulbasaur charge at Bellsprout but managed to flip it above its head using its own momentum against itself. Ash was stunned by Bellsprout`s agility. Bulbasaur was angered at being tossed aside so easily and charged once again at Bellsprout, but like before, was thrown away using its own momentum. Bellsprout took advantage of Bulbasaur being on the floor and thrown it towards Ash`s podium, showing great strength and eliminated Bulbasaur from the tie.
Ash choose Pikachu to try and defeat Bellsprout which would win Ash the round.
Bellsprout started prove a stubborn opponent again as it dodged Pikachu`s Thundershock attack and launched a Razor Leaf attack of its own, missing Pikachu but cutting into some rocks on the grass field which stunned the crowd.
Pikachu successfully launched a Thunderbolt attack on Bellsprout, however Ash was shocked was Bellsprout emerged unscathed. Jeanette explained that Bellsprouts feet act as lightningconductors which made it shock-proof. Knowing Pikachu could not rely on its electrical powers, Ash had Pikachu throw and array of punches and kicks towards Bellsprout but none landed successfully. Bellsprout saw an opening and landed a kick on Pikachu which eliminated it from the round.
Ash turned to his final Pokémon, a Muk
Due to Muk`s slow speed and bigger size it could not avoid Bellsprouts attack but thanks to its slimy and elastic body it was simply able to absorb them and not feel any damage. Bellsprout continued to launch a number of ounches, kicks and throws but still Muk absorbed them all. After repelling a Razor Leaf attack Muk smothered Bellsprout with its body and after a few seconds of struggling Bellsprout was defeated, giving Ash the victory and earned him a place in the final 16.
Jeanette picked up Bellsprout and praised it for its great effort in almost securing Jeanette a stunning comeback.</description>

Bulbasaur was angered at being tossed aside so easily and charged once again at Bellsprout, but like before, was thrown away using its own momentum. Bellsprout took advantage of Bulbasaur being on the floor and thrown it towards Ash`s podium, showing great strength and eliminated Bulbasaur from the tie.
Ash choose Pikachu to try and defeat Bellsprout which would win Ash the round.
Bellsprout started prove a stubborn opponent again as it dodged Pikachu`s Thundershock attack and launched a Razor Leaf attack of its own, missing Pikachu but cutting into some rocks on the grass field which stunned the crowd.
Pikachu successfully launched a Thunderbolt attack on Bellsprout, however Ash was shocked was Bellsprout emerged unscathed. Jeanette explained that Bellsprouts feet act as lightningconductors which made it shock-proof. Knowing Pikachu could not rely on its electrical powers, Ash had Pikachu throw and array of punches and kicks towards Bellsprout but none landed successfully. Bellsprout saw an opening and landed a kick on Pikachu which eliminated it from the round.
Ash turned to his final Pokémon, a Muk
Due to Muk`s slow speed and bigger size it could not avoid Bellsprouts attack but thanks to its slimy and elastic body it was simply able to absorb them and not feel any damage. Bellsprout continued to launch a number of ounches, kicks and throws but still Muk absorbed them all. After repelling a Razor Leaf attack Muk smothered Bellsprout with its body and after a few seconds of struggling Bellsprout was defeated, giving Ash the victory and earned him a place in the final 16.
Bellsprout was picked up by Jeanette and was praised in its great effort in almost securing Jeanette a stunning comeback.</description>

<description>Ritchie is a Pokémon Trainer who managed to qualify for the Kanto Pokémon League.
Kanto Pokémon League:
After getting into the fifth round of the tournamnet he met another Pokémon Trainer called Ash Ketchum who he befriended after managing to scupper Team Rocket`s plan to steal the contestants Pokémon.
Once receiving the draw for the fifth round of the Kanto Pokémon League Ritchie found out he would be against his newest friend, Ash Ketchum.
Round 5 - Vs Ash Ketchum:
Squirtle was Ash`s first choice Pokémon and was pitched against Ritchie`s Butterfree. Both Pokémon traded blows until Ritchie ordered Happy to use Sleep Powder and managed to put Squirtle to sleep which eliminated it from the battle.
Pikachu lept into battle to try and put Ash back on level terms. Pikachu quickly launched itself at Butterfree and managed to pin it onto the arena floor. Butterfree managed to get back into the air but Pikachu held on and used a Thunderbolt attack to beat Butterfree which put the battle back on level terms.
Charmander was Ritchie`s second choice Pokémon. Charmander started by unleashing flamethrower attacks at Pikachu that it struggled to avoid and Pikachu was showing that it was was beginning to get tired. Charmander charged at Pikachu which connected and Pikachu was unable to continue.
Ash pondered over his next choice of Pokémon as he knew he was trailing and decided to gamble on Charizard. Charizard originally appeared like it was not going to do anything but after Ritchie`s Charmander narrowly missed with a flamethrower, Charizard decided to fight back with a flamethrower of its own with panicked Charmander and forced Ritchie to recall it.
Pikachu was Ritchie`s third and final Pokémon in the battle and was against Ash`s Charizard which had just forced Charmander to be switched. Charizard trembled the ground with a couple of stomps making Pikachu lose its balance and then blew Pikachu away using a gust from its wings. Seemingly thinking Pikachu was not a worthy opponent, Charizard took a nap in the middle of a battle and despite Ash pleaded with it to battle, it was eliminated. This gave Sparky the victory over Charizard and put Ritchie into round six.
The two trainers remained friends after their battle.
Round Six - Vs Assumpta:
It was a close battle after Ritchie`s Charmander and Butterfree battled Assumpta`s Rhydon and Venomoth respectively.
Both trainers were down to their last Pokémon and it was Ritchie`s Pikachu versus Assumpta`s Ivysaur. Ivysaur quickly charged at Pikachu who just managed to avoid the attack, however, Ivysaur used Vine Whip which swept Pikachu off of its feet. Ivysaur charged again at Pikachu who tried to halt its progress with a Thundershock but Ivysaur either dodged the attack or defended itself with its vines. Ivysaur then launched itself in the air and launched a Solarbeam attack followed by a tackle attack which Pikachu could not recover from and eliminated Ritchie from the competition.</description>

<description>Umberto lived on an island where there were many Kabuto fossils and he beleived that should the fossils ever be disturbed that the moon would turn red and the island would sink into the sea.
When an expedition team led by Nurse Joy arrived on the island, Umberto tried to ward them off the island by attempting to make a boulder fall on the team.
Ash managed to track Umberto down and he admitted that he was not trying to harm them, just warn them away. Nurse Joy did not beleive the tale of the red moon and continued looking for the Kabuto fossils.
After the expedition team disturbed the fossils the moon turned red and the island began to rumble and the island began to shake. The team did not have time to reach their boats so Umberto told them to build rafts from the trees and managed to sail away from the island along with Ash, Tracey, Misty and the expedition team.</description>

<description>When Ash, Tracey and Misty found themselves in the city of Trovitopolis they met the mayor of the city who at the time was running a campaign for re-election.
Ash mentioned to the mayor that his Bulbasaur had got kidnapped in the city`s sewers and the mayor replied that he was sending his personal SWAT team to hunt the monster down to stop it from terrorising the city.
It emerged that the `monster` was actually a Bulbasaur which the mayor had long abandoned because it would not evolve. Due to his previous cruel acts the city folk refused to re-elect the major and his Bulbasaur was looked after in the nearby Pokécentrer.</description>

<description>Bulbasaur was abandoned by the Mayor of Trovitopolis when the mayor was a child because the Bulbasaur would not evolve into a Ivysaur.
To survive in the sewers of Trovitopolis, the Bulbasaur would use its vinewhip to steal food off people living on the surface. With the strange occurances happening over the city it eventually led the public to beleive that the sewers actually housed a monster.
The mayor responded by sending his personal SWAT team to hunt the monster down to stop it from terrorising the city.

<description>There were many strange occurances in the city of Trovitopolis where several members of the public had their food stolen from them, leading people to beleive that the city`s sewers was housing a monster. In addition, Ash mentioned to the mayor that his Bulbasaur had got kidnapped in the city`s sewers and the mayor replied that he was sending his personal SWAT team to hunt the monster down to stop it from terrorising the city.
Jessie, James and Meowth had just been spooked by the "monster" in the sewers and thought that if they made themselves looked scary they could spook the monster in return. However, instead of running into the monster they actually ran into the SWAT team who mistook them for the real monster. The SWAT team fired their glue guns on Jessie, James and Meowth and returned to the surface.
It emerged that the `monster` was actually a Bulbasaur which the mayor had long abandoned because it would not evolve. Due to his previous cruel acts the city folk refused to re-elect the major and his Bulbasaur was looked after in the nearby Pokécentrer.</description>

<description>Rudy is the Gym Leader of the Trovita Island Gym which is a gym located on an island just off the coast of Trovitopolis. Any trainer who can pass his `attack test` and defeat in in a Pokémon battle will earn the Spike Shell Badge.
When Rudy battled Ash, the rules were that Rudy would choose Pokémon of the same type as Ash. So Rudy`s Electabuzz went up against Pikachu, Exeggutor against Bulbasaur and Starmie against Squirtle. Rudy has a Pokémon in his gym that would cover every Pokémon type except ghost (and the new types added in the Gold &amp; Silver generation).
Rudy uses dancing techniques to improves a Pokémon footwork and agility. Rudy himself also enjoys to dance.
Rudy`s younger sister lives on Trovita Island along with Rudy and a few additional trainers.</description>

<description>Gulzar claims he is the best Grass-Type Pokémon trainer in the Orange Islands. He ended up challenging Ash to a battle and used his Gloom. Ash responded by wanting to use his Charizard but actually used his Squirtle by mistake. Gloom was highly resistant to Squirtle`s Water Gun attack and forced Ash to switch Pokémon. Once again Ash wanted to choose Charizard but sent out Snorlax by accident.
Gloom used solarbeam on the sleeping Snorlax but only managed to wake it up. Ash`s Snorlax tried to eat his Gloom, actually ate the flowers he kept in his headband and ate his lunch.

<description>Orange League Final - Vs. Ash Ketchum (Rocky Field)
Drake selected the first Pokémon in the battle and selected Ditto who the commentator pointed out that many trainers had lost their cool against ditto as they got frustration seeing their own attacks being launch against them.
Ash responded by sending out Pikachu and Drake`s first move was to have Ditto transform into Pikachu. Ash`s first move was a Thunder attack but the transformed Ditto manage to shrug it off and launch a Thunder attack of its own that hit Ash`s Pikachu. Both trainers then order their Pokémon to use a Thunderbolt attack that struck each other and the power caused the rocks they were standing on to collaspe. Drake`s Ditto managed to land on its feet but Ash`s Pikachu fell on the arena floor. Pikachu struggled to get and Misty wanted Ash to switch Pokémon, however, Ash refused to beleive that Ditto, who was copying Pikachu, could beat the original.
Ash stuck with Pikachu and Drake ordered his Ditto to use agility. Ash responded by having Pikachu use Thunderbolt but Ditto dodged it and launched a Thunderbolt attack of its own. Ash had Pikachu ground itself and took no damage from the attack, then, Pikachu used Agility to get close to Drake`s Ditto who was also using Agility and both Pokémon used Thunderbolt and collided in mid-air. Pikachu was the first Pokémon to get to its feet and swiped at Ditto using its tail whilst charged with electricity, knocking Ditto to the floor and eliminating it from the battle giving Ash the initial advantage.</description>

Pikachu had given Ash the advantage by defeating Drake`s Ditto but was very Tired.
Drake selected Onix and Ash recalls an exhausted Pikachu to be replaced by Squirtle. Ash makes the first move and has Squirtle use Water Gun, but, before it can connect Drake has his onix use Dig and it goes underground. Squirtle headed towards the water pool in the middle of the arena but Onix emerged just before it reached it and then managed to trap Squirtle in Wrap.
Squirtle struggled to get free but the Wrap was too strong, however, Ash managed to get Squirtle to use Hydro Pump which managed to strike Onix and release Squirtle from the Wrap attack. Squirtle used Skull Bash on the Onix and eliminated Drake`s second Pokémon in the battle.</description>

Ash chooses Tauros as his third Pokémon to go against Drake`s Gengar.
Ash tells Tauros to begin with Fissure but Gengar jumps into the air and avoids the attack. Whilst in the air Gengar uses Confuse Ray which makes Tauros attack the nearby rock and damage itself in the process. Ash quickly recalls Tauros and sends out Lapras in the water pool in the middle of the stage.
Ash quickly recalls Tauros and sends out Lapras in the water pool in the middle of the stage.
Lapras goes underwater to dodge Gengar`s initial attack and then resurfaced to shoot a water gun directly at Gengar who only manage to get out of the way after taking some damage. Gengar shoots Night Shade at Lapras who counter attacks with Ice Beam, the two attacks collide with each other and the resulting explosion eliminate both Pokémon which meant Drake has lost three Pokémon and Ash had only lost one.</description>

<description>Orange League Final - Vs. Ash Ketchum (Sand Field)
With Drake losing his third Pokémon there was a short interval whilst the battle field change into a sandy field.
The interval ended and Drake began by choosing Venusaur whilst Ash brought Tauros back into the battle who had now recovered from Gengar`s Confuse Ray. Ash`s first move was to have Tauros stamp its feet to use Fissure, however, the soft sand absorbed the move. Drake took advantage of the situation by having Venusaur use Solarbeam but knowing Solarbeam takes a while to charge up, Ash have Tauros charge straight towards Drake`s Venusaur and flip it into the air just before it fired. Venusaur managed to adjust itself mid-air and fire the Solarbeam at Tauros. The impact was close to Tauros and knocked it down but it managed to recover and get back to its feet quickly.
Venusaur struck Tauros with one of its Vine Whip attacks but Tauros manage to avoid any further strikes and successfully land a Take Down move on Venusaur and eliminate it from the battle.</description>

Bulbasuar manage to shake of Electabuzz`s initial Thundershock attack and returned a Razor Leaf attack which struck Electabuzz, although, whilst being hit by Razor Leaf, Electabuzz manage to use a Thunderbolt attack that Bulbasaur quickly dodged.
Bulbasaur uses Tackle and causes some light damage to Electabuzz but taking advantage of how close Bulbasur was, it manage to hit Bulbasaur with a Thunderpunch which eliminated it.
Ash chose Charizard to battle against Electabuzz and ordered it to use Flamethrower against Electabuzz, who quickly jumped into the air and landed a Thunderpunch onto Charizard and follwowed up by shocking Charizard with an electric attack. Charizard managed to release himself from the electricity by firing a Fire Spin and then Charizard flew towards Electabuzz quickly making sure it could not use it Thunderbolt attack. Charizard got a good grip on Electabuzz and flew into the air and used Seismic Toss on it which eliminated it and left Drake with one Pokémon left.</description>

<description>Orange League Final - Vs. Ash Ketchum (Sand Field)
Drake`s final Pokémon was his prized Dragonite who he sent out to battle Ash`s Charizard.
Charizard moved first by using a Flamethrower attack but Dragonite countered by using Water Gun which cuts through the Flamethrower and hits Charizard, who then takes to the skies whilst avoiding Dragonite`s Ice Beam.
Dragonite then takes to the sky itself showing great speed as it does so. Dragonite and Charizard exchange Ice Beam and Flamethrower attacks respectively but it is Dragonite who manages to clip Charizard wing using Ice Beam which send Charizard spinning to the ground. Charizard recovers and flies close to Dragonite in an attempt to use a Seismic Toss attack, however, Dragonite avoids and gets a good grip on Charizard which gives it the opportunity to use a Slam attack.
Charizard gets up quick although it is clearly tired but it has enough stength to launch a Dragon Rage attack. Dragonite uses the same move, the attacks collide and both Pokémon are sent flying backwards. When the dust settles both Pokémon are standing but exhausted from the previous battle, after a few deep breaths Charizard falls to the ground and is eliminated.
Ash recalled Squirtle into battle for a second time and pitched it against Drake`s Dragonite. Ash order Squirtle to use Hydro Pump against Dragonite but gets pushed back by Dragonite`s Water Gun. Dragonite uses a Thunderbolt attack which Squirtle sees and withdraws into its shell and even though it took some damage, Squirlte continued to battle. Drake attempted to finish Squirtle by having it use Body Slam, however, Squrtle uses Bubble causing Dragonite`s Body Slam to fail although it then uses Tail Whip and strikes Squirle which then eliminates it from the battle.
Tauros was switched in again after Ash recalled the eliminated Squirtle. Tauros charged into the middle of the field whilst Dragonite flew up and use Body Slam. To Drake`s suprise Ash told Tauros to stand its ground and endure the hit, which it does so successfully and even manages to throw Dragonite to the floor using its horns.
Dragonite get up and uses Thunderbolt which proves too much for Tauros and eliminates it from the battle leaving Ash with one Pokémon left.
Ash was left with his Pikachu and sent it out against Dragonite that had already taken down three of his Pokémon in a row. Ash began by having Pikachu use Agility although Dragonite shown its speed also by striking Pikachu with its tail and sends Pikachu into the sand. Dragonite attempts to end the battle with a Hype Beam but at the last second Pikachu uses its tail as a spring and jumps to avoid the powerful attack. Dragonite was tired after using Hyper Beam and gave Pikachu the chance to land right on top of its head. Pikachu used a Thunder attack which could be seen from outside of the arena. Dragonite managed to shake Pikachu off and stay on its feet, but after a few deep breaths and fell to the arena floor from the sheer amount damage taken during the battle. Dragonite was eliminated and Ash won the battle and claimed the Winner`s Trophy.</description>

Jessie, James and Meowth disturbed the Pinsir`s territory by stealing all of their sap from the trees. The Pinsir vacated their own territory and took over the more passive Heracross`s territory easily as they are the more agreesive Pokémon.
With the help of Ash, Misty and Brock they drove Team Rocket out of the forest and the Pinsir quickly returned to their original home and the Heracross reclaimed their own territory. After waving goodbye to Ash and friends, Woodrow remained in the forest to continue his surveys</description>

<description>Chansey enrolled at a school that was designed specifically for Chansey. It struggled at first but managed to befriend a Jessie who was taking the same course despite being a human. Jessie helped Chansey in its study and started to do well on the course unlike Jessie who could not stay awake during the Chansey`s Sing ability, which was used to lull restless Pokémon to sleep.
Just before Jessie left the college, the Chansey that she made friends with, which had just graduated managed to catch up with Jessie and tried to persuade her to finish the course. Jessie explained that she would not be able to finish the course and so Chansey snapped its graduation medal in half and get one half to Jessie as a token of their friendship.
During the next few years Chansey evolved into a Blissey and manage to land a nursing position in a Pokémon Centre in Happy Town in the Johto region despite remaining slightly clumsey and over-eager to help at times. Some time later it was reunited with Jessie when they met in a Pokémon Centre in Johto. Blissey tried helping Jessie by giving her the food that was stored in the Pokémon Centre.
Blissey was caught on the Pokémon security cameras taking food from the Pokémon Centre`s storeroom and faced losing its position as a nurse.
Jessie did not want Blissey to lose its dream job which it worked hard for so James, Meowth and herself claimed they tricked Blissey into giving the food away and even attacked Blissey to make it look convincing.
Ash Ketchum made Jessie, James and Meowth blast off but not before Jessie ensured the events at the Pokémon centre will be kept a secret. Blissey and Jessie kept their pieces of the graduation medal and remained friends.

Alolan Region Pokémon Centers
Nurse Joy`s Blissey are also great companions to the Joy`s in the Alola region. They sense sadness with its fluffy coat of fur. If it does so, this Pokémon will rush over to a sad person, no matter how far away, to share a Lucky Egg that brings a smile to any face.</description>

<description>A professor who teaches Chansey in the skills it takes to be a Pokémon Nurse and maybe go on to work in a Pokémon Centre.
She holds classes in bandaging and improving Chansey`s Sing ability which is used to lull restless Pokémon patients to sleep.
Although primarily a teacher of Pokémon nursing she found that one year she had a human in one of her classes called Jessie. Jessie was good at the bandaging class but could not stay awake when the Chansey were using their Sing ability. Jessie eventually dropped out of the Nursing School when she realised that she was not suited to the class.</description>

<description>Simon is striving to become a Pokémon Interpreter as he has had various experiences in his life where he has been able to effectively communicate with Pokémon. Ash and his friends encountered him as he suggested to them that they should come to his rest stop so they could recharge Pikachu after he quickly talked with Pikachu to find out what was wrong with it. Simon generally charges trainers a Pokémon Interpreting fee so he can use the money to maintain the rest stop.
Officer Jenny mistakenly tried to put Simon under arrest for conducting a Pokémon scam as there had been a lot of complaints recently in the area that someone has been swindling money from trainers while claiming to be a Pokémon Interpreter. Officer Jenny though that Simon fit the description perfectly but later after he ended up saving the Pokémon Center, she was informed by Nurse Joy that he was able to communicate enough with the Magnemite and Magneton to get them to stop draining the power. Officer Jenny`s opinion of Simon changed drastically enough for her to believe that he truly was a Pokémon Interpreter.
60 years earlier, Simon was caught in a thunderstorm and a tornado was approaching him as he watched in the field. His dad quickly picked him up and threw him in a storm celler and told him not to come out as he was going to check on the neighbors. Scared and wishing for his dad, Simon heard Pokémon voices and he could understand them. Simon was surprised that he could talk to them and he forgot about the storm until people came to get him. His farm was destroyed and he never saw the three Pokémon he talked to ever again.
Just before Simon said his farewell`s to Ash and his friends, they told him to keep working at becoming a Pokémon Interpreter as he just needed a small breakthrough. As Simon was walking, he encountered Team Rocket Meowth who old Simon to not give up as well.</description>

<description>Jasmine is the Gym Leader of the Olivine Gym and she also runs the Glitter Lighthouse in Olivine City where her Ampharos is stationed. She first met Ash and his friends at the lighthouse when her Ampharos was sick. Ash went and got some medicine for it.
At a later time, Ash challenged Jasmine for a gym badge. Ash`s Pikachu and Cyndaquil battled against her and proved to be a sufficient combo in order to defeat her and obtain the Mineral Badge.
Jasmine met up with Ash and Brock in Sunyshore City in the Sinnoh region. She met Dawn and the Sinnoh Elite Four member Flint. She challenged him to a battle with her Steelix but Flint used his Infernape which had a significant type advantage as well as being his most powerful Pokémon. Jasmine was easily defeated by Flint.</description>

<description>Ash challenged Jasmine for the Mineral Badge and she sent her Steelix out after Pikachu defeated her Magnemite. Steelix was able to knock out Pikachu as it was tired from its previous battle. Jasmine`s Steelix was then defeated by Ash`s Cyndaquil as two proved to be a sufficient combo to defeat Steelix.
While at Sunyshore City in the Sinnoh region, Jasmine met the Sinnoh Elite Four member Flint. She challenged him to a battle with her Steelix but Flint used his Infernape which had a significant type advantage as well as being his most powerful Pokémon. Jasmine`s Steelix was easily defeated by Flint`s Infernape.</description>

His name was confirmed in the Japanese closed captions for that episode.
With his co-worker Philip, they went to investigate the cause of the power outage which ended up being a large group of Grimer`s who were clogging up the tunnels where the water for the generators flowed. With Ash and Pikachu`s help, Philip and Dick were able to get the power plant up and running once again.</description>

During the snow storm, it said it wish it had pants. When Ash arrived, he was surprised that it could talk when it told him to put the treasures on the stone mantle. Ash was also surprised that it knew his name as it had studied the legend and had realized that the "earth shall turn to ash" part referred to him.</description>

<description>Mateo &amp; Marissa`s Grandfather ran a glass and crystal shop on Sunburst Island until he died. When he ran the store, it was full of glass and it was a big success. He was a really talented artist and he made beautiful glass Pokémon sculptures every day.
He told Mateo all the time that when he was a young artist he saw the Crystal Onix and that`s what inspired him to make great sculptures. After seeing the Crystal Onix, he turned out one great sculpture after another. Whenever he needed some inspiration, all he had to do was think of that Crystal Onix. Mateo &amp; Marissa took over his shop after he died and continued in his footsteps.</description>

<description>Fernando was first seen battling in the stadium at the Kentauros Battles at the trade meet festival in a town near Kogane City. When Ash and his friends came to watch the battle, they saw Fernando win his fifth consecutive victory with his Tauros. Ash was excited to battle after watching Fernando and he got Professor Samual Oak to transfer his Tauros over so he could battle. When Ash returned to the stadium, Fernando had just won his 10th consecutive win and the announcer was just about to declare him the victor as there was no more challengers.
Ash challenged Fernando to a battle but having won 10 battles already Fernando was quite confident. The battle didn`t last too long and it looked like Fernando`s Tauros was going to win but in a last effort, Ash`s Tauros used Take Down which flipped over Fernando`s Tauros and gave Ash the win.</description>

<title xml:lang="x-jat">Yadoking no Ichinichi</title>
<summary>The short describes a day in the life of Slowking. It starts when Slowking wakes up at dawn in his cave overlooking the three small islands close to Shamouti Island. Slowking goes down to the beach and uses his psychic abilities to grab a coconut for breakfast, opening it by banging it on the shell on his head. He then takes a walk around the shrine where the climactic scene of The Power of One took place, and stops to smell the flowers that surround it on the cliff. Yawning, Slowking then crawls onto a rock in the middle of the flower field and takes an afternoon nap. After a while, a Butterfree passes by as Slowking wakes up. Commenting on how good the weather is, Slowking walks to the edge of the cliff, stretches, and jumps into the ocean to swim. In the water, he meets and greets his good friend, a Seel. Eventually Slowking leaves the ocean with a lot of seafood, and eats it while sitting on the cliff and watching the sunset. As many stars shine in the sky, Slowking returns to his cave and falls asleep.</summary>
