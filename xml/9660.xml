<description>Note: Tezuka Osamu planned to make an animated version, but the project was always called off. This work was to make his dream come true at last, but he was unfortunately struck by an illness and died when he was working on the synopsis. This was one of his unfinished works. It was aired during NHK`s "Tezuka Osamu, Seikimatsu e no Message" (手塚治虫・世紀末へのメッセージ) program.</description>

<description>Due to unforeseen circumstances, the production or release of this anime has been pushed back, stalled, or cancelled one or more times from when it was first announced.
While some of them have eventually been completed, others might have only had a trailer released or have been changed into another format (e.g. a TV series turned into an OVA).
Common reasons for a work to become stuck in development hell include creative differences, legal issues, financial problems, scheduling conflicts or the death of an involved creator.</description>
