<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="109384">It felt childish compaired to fate zero and fate zero 2012, wich I watched before I wathed this. I found it to lighthearted and only watched this for completion sake; I would not have finished it if it did not know fate zero. fate zero felt deeper to me, and more complete, you could feel that this was a less matured story. Stil for fans a must see of course ;).</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="126957">After going through the timeline by watching Fate Zero, I was quite disappointed in the fact that it was lacking on the badassery department, I really liked the gunfighting parts in zero.
All that said, if you haven`t yet watched Fate Zero, I`d recommend you watch this.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="282072">good anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="147458">Even if you have not played the computer game, you have to watch it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="224488">A fairly decent action anime with good plot twists, an exceptional soundtrack, and an interesting storyline.  Also features a strong, intelligent, likeable female heroine, a compassionate male hero, and a touch of romance.  Loved it all the way through!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="214346">Great action and fantasy with classical history</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="293230">A must see!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="460841">Although better appreciated if one knows the backstory (visual novel), this series goes beyond your average game-based anime.
At the end of the series, you might find yourself cliffhanged by the several questions and possibilities that were not tackled. One of the three possible routes base of the game and also one of the seven paths towards Nasuversism.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="490197">It certainly is one of the best shounen animes you can find. Decent fights, plot development, drama, romance and a fitting ending. 
Sadly it`s lacking chracter development for most of the chracters in the series.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="594278">It`s true: the main character is probably one of the most annoying ones in the history of anime. Yet bear with it for the earlier part of the series and the show evolves to become something with great development and plot, balancing drama and action quite well. Tough to stomach in the beginning, but the ending`s well worth it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="430077">A good adaptation and managed to mix in more than just what you`d find one in the first route. The fight scenes are clearly superior in the anime but the story depth of the visual novel is obviously better. If you didn`t feel satisfied by the anime, read the novel. If you read the novel already then enjoy the animated fights instead. Regardless, it is a worthy show</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="393568">One of the best epic anime I have ever seen!!!! It`s a must SEE in deed!!!!!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="528918">Awesome story and characters, lots of action and romance. What else can you wish for?

One of the best anime I`ve seen in a while and I`m definitely going to watch it again. Must see :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="464550">A very short anime series, yet very entertaining and fun to watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="302120">An Anime with the "A". The most beautiful story of these years, a miscellaneaus of fantasy, adventure and drama never seen before. You will not get bored.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="293766">When I stared watching this, it was very hard to keep my eyes off of the screen. I did not stop watching until I was done. And then re-watched it! Fate Stay Night is my FAVORITE ANIMES OF ALL TIME! Amazing story, great character development, action packed, and very suspenseful. I loved the mythological references as well. And personally, I think it has one of the best main characters i`ve ever seen in any anime this far. Fate/Stay night gets a 10 in my book. It`s a must see for everyone.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="352064">one of the best anime shows i have seen...  fair warning though, its best if u play the visual novel, or if u dont have the time, just go to fate/stay night wikia and read through some info and u will get the whole story of fate/stay night....  u will be hooked, its a huge and detailed universe. the soundtrack, animation, and chemistry of characters are just beautiful</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="340905">great anime by TypeMoon ever!&lt;br /&gt;I wish fate hollow ataraxia, fate zero, fate stay night realta nua is being animated... T_T</recommendation>

<description>* Based on the erotic visual novel by http://anidb.net/cr927 [Type-Moon].
High school junior student http://anidb.net/ch1904 [Emiya Shirou] is twice an orphan. Once, a great fire that destroyed more than a hundred homes took the lives of his biological parents. He was then adopted by http://anidb.net/ch1919 [the man who saved him from that inferno], a man who called himself a magus; however, after a few years, that man, too, died. Shirou was left with a home, the dream to become a superhero, and some extremely limited knowledge of magecraft, the art practised in secret by magi all over the world. Now, unbeknownst to him, the city he lives in, Fuyuki City, is to become the place where a great war will be fought in secret by magi like the man who adopted him.
For this great war, seven magi shall gather together in Fuyuki. Each magus becomes a Master, and each Master summons a Servant, a spirit of a mighty hero of the past that, due to their almost almighty powers in life and to the faith people have put in them through the times, ascend to a higher level of existence, outside of time. Together, Master and Servant fight against the other teams for the possession of the Holy Grail, a relic said to be almighty and grant any wish, no matter how great. However, in order to allow the winning Master and Servant to be granted one wish each, all other teams must be defeated, and the enemy Servants annihilated. That war is thus called the Holy Grail War. The Holy Grail War has happened four times so far, and the fifth one is about to take place.
The hero each Servant was in life has fame, and as such their lives are well-known. By knowing the true name of a Servant, one clearly also knows its strengths and weaknesses; thus, it is the custom for each team to hide the identity of their Servant and try to find out those of the other ones. To better hide the identity, the Servants are usually referred to by their classes, http://anidb.net/ch38 [Saber], http://anidb.net/ch1906 [Archer], http://anidb.net/ch1908 [Lancer], http://anidb.net/ch1909 [Rider], http://anidb.net/ch1907 [Berserker], http://anidb.net/ch1910 [Caster], and http://anidb.net/ch1911 [Assassin].
One night, Shirou witnesses a fight between two servants, Archer and Lancer. To preserve the secrecy of the War, Lancer mortally wounds him. However, a girl who up until now was just a classmate of his and the school idol, http://anidb.net/ch241 [Toosaka Rin], saves his life by pouring all the magical energy from a pendant into fixing his heart. However, he gets attacked by Lancer again, and this time Rin will not be able to save him. Just as he`s about to die for good, he unwittingly summons Saber, who promptly drives Lancer off. The powerful sword user turns to Shirou and asks whether he is her Master, much to his bewilderment. In spite of being just a rank amateur, he now has to fight a war between powerful and experienced magi, and has people he knows turned into enemies.
— written by Hinoe
Note: This adaptation of Fate/stay night mashes up the main events of the Fate route with some points of the Unlimited Blade Works route and some original work loosely based on the Heaven`s Feel one.</description>

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>content indicators</name>
<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>magic circles</name>
<description>A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised.
Traditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for non-magical work such as meditation.
Generally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names.

<description>An erotic game (eroge) is a Japanese video or computer game that features erotic content, usually in the form of anime-style artwork. In English, eroge are often called hentai games in keeping with the English slang definition of hentai. This is sometimes shortened to H games. In Japan, eroge are also referred to as 18+ games. Most erotic games are visual novels or dating sims but are not limited to them.
Any anime adaptation of a game that contains (or had a version that contains) adult content (generally sex scenes), regardless of how some fanboys blabber on how "the story in that visual novel was too good to be labelled as porn!", should definitely get this category added under them. This should make it pretty clear as to what is an erotic game and what is not.</description>

<description>The two terms are similar yet different, however, the fact that they look and `feel` the same outweighs the technical differences. For clarification, visual novels are considered a sub-genre of adventure games and the term does not cover simulations. While the two genres often share a common visual presentation, dating sims are sometimes considered to be more statistically based than the "choose your own adventure" style of visual novels; basically, the choices you make might change something else than just the story arc (or your next porn pic). Dating sims can involve several technical elements such as a time limit, several statistics such as looks and charm which can be boosted through exercise, or an "attraction meter" which can increase or decrease depending on one`s decisions.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

<description>The long-term plot of the program revolves around a group of characters whose numbers are being slowly whittled away by one means or another, usually by killing each other. In the case of some reality shows, this is a process of elimination intended to result in a single winner. In other shows, this is a dramatic device, designed to generate tension and conflict with which to drive the overall plot of an episode or Story Arc (if any); in these cases it is sometimes combined with Anyone Can Die to especially heighten the resulting excitement, even when the apparent main character may be protected by Contractual Immortality. Compare Gotta Kill Them All.

But often, characters will exposit when it`s most needed: at the story`s climax, when both the intricacies of the plot and the intensity of action hit their highest.
While the Heroes Outrun the Fireball, Mr. Exposition might explain why the Evil Overlord`s death caused the explosion. The Action Girl can deliver impressive lectures on why the monster`s Achilles` Heel will work, while still engaging in Waif-Fu. The Superhero can quip to his heart`s content and explain his abilities while dueling one insignificant mobster, or deliver a Kirk Summation during the course of a single Finishing Move. Sometimes even apparent mere mortals can give a lecture on what is happening when it would be a much better idea to simply run like hell.

In Fate/Zero, though she and Emiya Kiritsugu are Servant and Master seeking the same ultimate goal of peace, their differing ideological perspectives result in a strained relationship where Kiritsugu does not directly acknowledge Saber. After Kiritsugu summoned Saber, he made Irisviel hide Avalon - which had served as a catalyst to the summoning - inside her body so to serve as insurance while she performed her act of fake Master. Irisviel`s and Saber`s role at the time was to openly take action and serve as a decoy in order to lure out enemies, while Kiritsugu worked in the shadows with his assistant, Hisau Maiya. Because Saber could not dematerialise her spiritual body, she disguised herself as a man while staying at Irisviel`s side.
In the Fate route, because her master Emiya Shirou cannot effectively provide her with Mana, she minimises her activity to preserve what she has. Saber is bewildered by Shirou`s "protective" tendencies, and believes his erratic and reckless behaviour jeopardise her chances of winning the Holy Grail War.</description>

<name>Toosaka Rin</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Toosaka Rin is a model student and idol of Shirou`s school, Rin is secretly a sorceress and Master in the Holy Grail War. She is descended from a long line of sorcerers, and though lacking a formal magic education, is extremely powerful in her own right. Her father was killed in the 4th Holy Grail War, and she has trained since his death to succeed him. She is perceptive, resourceful and avidly competitive. Although she tried to summon a Saber-class Servant, she accidentally called Archer instead.
Rin excels in transformation of energy, which includes storage of Mana in objects. She stores all of her mana in jewels that she charges daily to bypass her body`s natural limitations on releasing energy. She can detonate her jewels on contact with an object, resulting in a release of energy equivalent to an attack rank of "A". Her most common offensive spell is "Gandr", which fires concentrated mana in the form of a black orb from her finger. On contact, the spell amplifies physical conditions -- a person who is already sick, for example, becomes far sicker upon being hit. Rin is also proficient with reinforcement sorcery, which she uses on her legs to give herself more speed.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>He is the Servant of one of the series` main heroines, Toosaka Rin. Archer is sarcastic and cynical - but under his hardened exterior lies a complex and dark personality that unfolds throughout the story. Though skilled with ranged weapons, he can hold his own in melee combat. Archer considers Shirou Emiya`s idealism to be weak and delusional, recognising Shirou`s mentality of "wanting to save everyone" as naïve and impossible.
Archer is actually an older version of Emiya Shirou, who actually became a heroic spirit in his own right in the future. Embittered and betrayed by his ideals, he participates in the Holy Grail War in an opportunity to kill his past self and in the ensuing paradox free himself from the path which led to his betrayal.</description>

Taiga is largely a comic relief character; she is irresponsible, clumsy, and prone to sporadic bouts of extreme lethargy or zest. She lives with Shirou under the pretences of being his caretaker, although she cannot cook and lacks many other domestic skills, relying on Shirou to maintain her welfare. Shirou, however, appreciates Taiga`s company, and is more than happy to care for her. When Shirou is in any need of advice, Taiga can be depended on to be a confidante for his worries.</description>

<description>A trans-national, self-preservative organisation created by western magi for the purpose of controlling, concealing and developing Magecraft. Founded around the Middle Ages by those who foresaw the decline of Magecraft, they decided that in order to preserve their power Thaumaturgy should drift apart from society and become a secret known only by a necessary minimum number of people.
It has many laboratories and research bodies that seek to advance the progress of Thaumaturgy, as well as institutions that transmit their secrets to the next generation. Although the emphasis lies on the pursuit of knowledge, the Association also seeks to increase its own military strength so it can defend itself against those that might threaten it, such as the Holy Church, other mystic organizations and supernatural forces seeking punish mankind for meddling with areas that should not be touched.
The Mage`s Association is currently headquartered at the Clock Tower in London.</description>

<charactertype id="3">Organization</charactertype>
<description>The Holy Church, also referred simply as "the Church", is a worldwide religious organisation, apparently styled after the real Roman Catholic Church. It is a powerful faction in the Nasuverse, with several important characters in the `verse works being its active or former members. On the surface, they coexist rather peacefully with the http://anidb.net/ch1951 [Mage`s Association], but that is only out of necessity, and neither group will waste an opportunity to backstab the other. They sometimes act as arbiters in the Association`s internal disputes; one such example are the Holy Grail Wars. Aside their regular duties as a normal religious group, they have a few special agencies dedicated to supernatural events.
The Assembly of the Eighth Sacrament, the lowest among the Church`s special agencies, is charged with researching, recovering and managing Holy Relics, items considered to have the holy attribute, scattered around the world. Their name comes from the seven Sacraments of the Catholic Church. As the Holy Grail is a Holy Relic, they`re in charge of managing every Holy Grail that appears; as such, in order to watch over the Holy Grail War, the priest stationed at Fuyuki City is always a member of this agency and is the one who acts as the war`s Supervisor.
The Church is also very active and relentless in the pursue and elimination of heretics, beings acting in disagreement with the Holy Scriptures. The members of the Church in that line of work are called Executors, and their specialties include magus hunting, demon killing, and vampire slaying. Among them, the most powerful ones are members of the Burial Agency, a group always composed of eight Executors, one of whom is the leader and another of whom is not an acting member, but a backup. Members of the Burial Agency work alone, and they will act without orders if they deem necessary, even going as far as skewering bishops, which earned them the reputation of the most heretic group inside the Church.
Among the items the Holy Church uses for its purposes, one can find the many types of Keys of Providence, Conceptual Weapons used for purification, and the Holy Scriptures, very powerful Conceptual Weapons used only by a few select Executors. Examples of Keys of Providence are http://anidb.net/ch1916 [Kotomine Kirei]`s most used weapons, the Black Keys, sword-shaped items that can be thrown at an opponent in order to pierce them and that do not have a blade when inside the priest`s frock. An example of a Holy Scripture is the Seventh Holy Scripture, used by http://anidb.net/ch1941 [Ciel], a massive metal weapon which can kill a vampire through physical power alone, shoots Bible pages, has an unicorn horn for a bayonet, and has a http://anidb.net/ch31725 [residing spirit].</description>
