<description>Delete Beach is a futuristic tale set in the near future about a schoolgirl who joins an anti-capitalist resistance group. In a society in which carbon-based energy is outlawed but which continues to toil under the regime of expansion and growth, petroleum is the fighters` refuge. They smoke it, squander it and hand over their bodies to the sea, to eventually provide fuel for future struggles.
Inspired by idyllic Scandinavian landscapes and the eco-feminist themes which propose anime as a political genre, director Phil Collins` collaboration with one of Japan`s leading animation studios http://anidb.net/cr738 [STUDIO 4C] and award winning composer http://anidb.net/cr47710 [Mica Levi] brings to life a world at once familiar and disquietingly corroded, left unmoored of any certainty in an age after the end of oil.

<description>Typically used when an OVA only has one part and is less than the usual 20 to 25 minutes in length.
So instead of calling it a `short episode`, the `short movie` tag is more appropriate.</description>
