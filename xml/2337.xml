<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Wakabayashi Genzou is an extroardinary goalkeeper who can catch almost anything thrown at him. Not many shots can come past Genzou. A charismatic guy, Genzou is also loyal to his friends and he is firm with his decisions. Genzou always keeps his feelings to himself and people close to him as seen in Shin Captain Tsubasa, when he`s willingly criticize his teammates` performance in order to make them realize that football in Europe is different than what they play in Japan. His actions caused a lot of Japanese players to dislike him and Genzou only told Tsubasa his true intentions. From early childhood, he has aimed to be the best goalkeeper in the world. He tended to be selfish, and brag about his skills before he met and played a couple of games against Tsubasa. After his match against Tsubasa, he has learned to enjoy the game with his other teammates.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>To help his family, Hyuuga Kojirou wants to be a professional player, an ace striker. His devotion to football and his persistence to shoot the goal is outstanding. He was both Tsubasa`s and Genzou`s top rival. A great guy, Hyuuga is not only strong, he is also tough but at the same time caring. Can be a bit impulsive at times, though. He was once famous because of his roughness and many players were scared of him. But, Hyuuga is actually a kind boy who cares about his family and friends. In the World Youth series, Hyuuga was one of the 7 players to be excluded from the Japanese National team after they lost 3 group matches with Real Japan 7 (R.J.7). Determined to get back into the team, Hyuuga developed a new shot, the Raijuu shot, a shot which is a bit similar to Tsubasa`s Drive Shoot, except that Hyuuga`s Raijuu Shot is a ground shot that will curve upward, unlike Tsubasa`s Drive Shooter which will go up then curve downward.</description>

<name>Wakashimazu Ken</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The "Karate Keeper", Wakashimazu Ken is a goalkeeper on par with http://anidb.net/ch2084 [Wakabayashi Genzou], but more offense-oriented. As his nickname implies, he is an expert karateka since his father is the master of a dojo. His father originally disapproved his efforts to become a footballer and his opposition to become the heir of the dojo.
Wakashimazu became interested in football when http://anidb.net/ch8344 [Hyuuga Kojirou] invited him to join the Meiwa team after being impressed by his abilities in a one-on-one duel that Wakashimazu lost. Since then, they are close friends.
Despite being an excellent goalkeeper, he originally was a forward and only became goalkeeper because Meiwa didn`t have competent goalkeepers.
A reliable partner of Hyuga while in the Meiwa and Toho teams, he and Wakabayashi regularly alternate in the goalkeeper position with the Japanese team.</description>

<summary>When the Japanese team arrives in Europe they meet incredible players with skills and strength they never had to face before. Shortly after the beginning of the match the Tachibana brothers shoot a goal with their "acrobatic soccer", but the Europeans have a supreme organisation and their legendary captain Karl-Heinz Schneider from Germany seems to be undefeatable. For Wakashimazu is totally overcharged with Schneider, the injured goalkeeper genius Wakabayashi takes his place and manages to stop Schneider`s "fire shots". After that Japan finally manages to win the match 3:2.</summary>
