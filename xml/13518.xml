<name>baseball</name>
<description>Baseball is like a complicated version of Rounders. It involves hitting a ball with a stick, then running around several bases placed in the form of a diamond on a field. Big in the US, and also in Japan.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>The story`s main character, Goro Honda is a young talented baseball player. His love of the game stems from his father who played for the Yokohama Marine Stars. Wanting nothing more than to follow in his father`s footsteps, he strives to become a professional ball player. Thriving on the challenge of the mound, he puts everything into the competition. He makes friends easily, as people are drawn to his personality and his excitement of the game. After Momoko and Hideki married his name was changed to Goro Shigeno. He initially pitched right handed, but blew out his shoulder in senior little league. In junior high school and high school, he pitches left, but continues to bat right. While he never made it to Koshien, his excellent match against the Kaido High School earned him the attention of many professional baseball team`s scouts. However, he went to America and joined a Triple A team, the Memphis Bats. During the Baseball World Cup, he replaced the injured pitcher Noro, and played as an excellent closer. He used to only use the pitch gyroballs ("rising fastball"), though beginning with the Baseball World Cup, he has successfully added gyrofork ("forkball") to his repertoire.</description>

<summary>In their first match of the summer tournament, the Mifune Dolphins lost all of the four point lead they had due to Daigo`s grave mistake.
Daigo is completely demoralized and depressed about that mistake, when an unexpected voice makes him look up at the fence.
Unbelievably, Hikaru had come there all the way from Gunma!
Slightly awkward, as he left the team behind back then, Hikaru was there without a uniform just to cheer the team on.
But what`s that in Hikaru`s bag?!

The Dolphins, who`ve been being beaten out in the first match the past years, are about to face the Tanikawa Eagles. Coach Tashiro, acknowledging his growth, puts in Daigo on the right field and 2nd batter. However, the star player Urabe and Nagai, now bumped down to 8th batter for Daigo, are not thrilled that someone riding on his father`s coattails is on the starting line up, and glare at Daigo.

The Dolphins lose 2 points from the get go as their opponents exploit the weak bond between Urabe and Daigo, as it`s their first time being a battery.
On top of that, the Beatles` ace player Tamaki throws ultra slow balls, which make hits hard, but even when a hit is made, their defense easily takes care of that.

The Beatles` ace player Tamaki is exceptionally tall for a grade schooler and brings his arcing slow ball to the fight.
As he had gone to observe them before, Urabe could warn the team of the odd style pitches.
On top of that, the Beatles` coach Komori had once been a solid enough player to be battery with Daigo`s dad, Gorou, and he even used to coach the Dolphins before...
Now Daigo has to face a team full of tricks and surprises!
