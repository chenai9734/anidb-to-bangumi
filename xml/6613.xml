<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="9461">Pretentious shit about a fighter who looks away from his opponent to talk with his pompous bride. Naturally, it also has the curse of the talking villain. Funny? Also fail.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="404450">The characters are interesting, with the main character being pretty much the only one that could be called out of the ordinary. The plot seemed to have an arc yet it feels incomplete, too corny at times and casual at others. It was okay but it didn`t rock my world :P</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="432674">AWESOME! hey, this should fall in comedy too. I enjoyed the laughs, great plot, nice art, the characters looks strong yet cute! Every after episode makes me want some more. You might cry/whine in the ending but OVER ALL this is recommended  by me! =)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="117590">Suprisingly brutal and merciless scenes for a story so mild ,it indeed keeps you for the whole hour of each episode</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="38355">Nisioisin`s trademark clever dialogue and quirky, likeable characters + incredibly fluid, colorful animation = great combo.  Definitely worth the wait between episodes.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="417398">Simply put, brilliant. Very unique, superbly animated along with a great plot.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="155853">First I had a look at the poster here in anidb and I was put-off by the overly colorful and "cute" style. Then I read the story synopsis and the comments and decided to give it a try. The first episode left me uncertain. The second episode hooked me. From that point on this series was an absolute blast for me. Frantic action and fantastic dialog interludes (or is it the other way around ?) share the viewing time of this surprisingly good anime. The story is simple, yet sublime, the characterization superb, humor drama and action mingle with ease and create a thoroughly entertaining romp that leads to a powerful ending.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="203241">Tear tearing</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="691547">This is another jewel of one of my favorites

But in the end it was totally worth it</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="619127">With awesome music and even better fight scenes and character development, don`t let it`s art style dissuade you from watching this gem. Highly recommended.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="58155">Beautiful schow, which design mysteriously grabs you and pulls you along powerfully. far out of the ordinary storytelling and unique characters make this show a must see for anyone, and especially for those who like the not stereotype samurai-themed anime. Best show of 2010 overall IMHO. too bad it comes out only once a month, but that might actually make the show even better.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="83912">Basic martial arts beginning episode 1-3, but 4 is amazingly creepy and exciting.  The creator truely has a wickedly deep mind to make that episode.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="469109">SO GOOD... lol  nah its not really ment to be a battle for most the ep kinda anime, but it does it well...

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="471794">Beautiful art, good animation, nice soundtrack, but the best thing is the story. By the first four or five episodes you may think that, even being violent, it is quite innocent. That impression just falls apart as the plot develops. Togame and Shichika are two of my favorite characters by now. Really recommended!!:D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="142954">EPIC!!! For me it`s like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon film One of the best must see.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="296364">This anime starts off slow, I started off watching this anime with my friend when it first came out, he dropped it said it was too slow. Honestly I felt it was slow but I kept watching the pace picked up, I gained more interest, I kept wanting more of it, finally i`ve watched the ending and i`m happy I watched this anime its great. If you start to watch it DO NOT DROP IT watch it to the end you wont regret it!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="270152">great art great story a little bit complicated and at parts not very reasanoble but it was great overall</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="301144">This is one of the best anime`s ever produced until now (2011) - You would be a fool and not see this superb creation.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="294356">What a beautiful story, very unique and vary entertaining. I just love each and every episode. It`s one of the best animes I have watched so far.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="446193">With a crazy cast of characters, a strong backbone of great music and a slick art style, Katanagatari has enough thrills to balance out NisiOisin`s wordy script, all for a simple, and groundbreaking story.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="379737">unique art AND awesome story MUST SEE!!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="437142">Excellent work of art. I was getting really tired of seeing anime that`s just a rehash of one or several anime i`ve already seen. This is like a fresh spring breeze compared to everything i`ve watched lately. 
Very original and artistic 10/10</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="179239">To make it short: This Anime is awesome for those who like unusual animation and character styles. The plot is easy, but the story and the character develop in a good pace up to a, in my opinion, surprising last episode. I loved it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="368178">simply excellent anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="346924">Great plot and interesting characters development, awesome animation and good soundtrack - I give it 8.5/10 just because I was really not convinced by the plot twist at the ending, but overall this one is a must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="599448">Absolutely amazing! A great story with quite a bit of character growth. The long dialogs may throw you off for the genre but they are worth it. The uncomon artwork is quite pleasing to the eye.

You cannot possibly miss it!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="524408">it is a must see .. watch and see for yourself i have my doubts that you will think it was a waste of time</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="127948">Strange at first, but ones you start watching you can`t stop. Absolutely brilliant ending, which is certainly worth mentioning as many other anime fail where Katanagatari succeeds. Must see definitely.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="71577">Unique art style, yet the storytelling/dialogue-heaviness is very Nishio Ishin-like. Takes quite a different approach from the *monogatari series plot-wise - it has quite a bit of action, too. Very unique (even in terms of the 50 min long eps) and intriguing and with its awesome character development I think it`s a must see.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on a light novel series by http://anidb.net/cr5970 [Nishio Ishin].
The legendary swordsmith Shikizaki Kiki made 1000 swords in his career. The more of these swords a state had, the greater the success in battle. When the Shogun emerged victorious, he collected 988 of the swords... but those were only the swordsmith`s inferior practice pieces. For the final twelve swords were the pinnacle of his career. Each of them has powers so extraordinary, that one man wielding one of them could defeat a small army.
Shogunate strategist http://anidb.net/ch13123 [Togame] has been ordered to recover all of them. She first hired a ninja... but the worth of the swords is so great the entire ninja clan defected the moment they recovered one. Then she hired a swordsman... though bound by honour, he felt he should keep the sword for himself.
Her last hope is http://anidb.net/ch13122 [Shichika], the seventh and last practitioner of the Kyotoryuu — the No Sword School. He and his sister live on an island cut off from civilization — so they have no need or use for money. His sword school does not use swords either — so he would not want the swords for himself.
So why should he help Togame?
"Because you will fall in love with me."

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>alternative past</name>
<description>An anime that takes place in an alternative past is an anime that clearly does not belong to the future or the present, and isn`t tied particularly closely to our history, or has ties to our history but only as a premise: there are too many things that don`t make sense for the time-period. In some cases there is futuristic technology present, but the overall setting still feels that of the past. However the setting must still take place on Earth, since we can not know if the history of a fantasy world is an alternate one or not.</description>

<description>A novel is a relatively long work of narrative fiction, normally written in prose form, and which is typically published as a book.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>adventure</name>
<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>comedy</name>
<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>important haircut</name>
<description>When a character cuts off his or her hair, it often symbolizes a rite of passage or bout of character growth. A princess striking out on an adventure, or a new recruit at boot camp, for instance. Hair is something that takes time and effort to grow, so parting with it voluntarily can be a powerful act.
This is particularly a big deal when women get haircuts. Yet in fiction, even an accidental hair slicing can leave a character with a surprisingly even cut.
In many religions (Western Christianity, Ancient Egyptian religion, and others) priests and/or monks cut/shave their hair. Roman Catholic nuns also tend to cut and mantain their hair short under their veils when they enter the nunneries. The cutting of one`s own hair is also a part of Buddhist mythology, specifically something done by Siddhartha himself early on in his path to enlightenment, so anime examples might draw from this as an allusion. There are also some cultures, including Native American and many Asians, where a person would cut his or her hair as an act of grief, disgrace, or even rebellion. In the Confucian tradition, hair (like the rest of your body) is considered a gift from your parents and may not be damaged without a very good reason. Furthermore, prisoners and psychiatric patients commonly have their heads shaved, often to prevent the spread of lice, but sometimes also as a demeaning measure.

<description>noitaminA (ノイタミナ) – Animation written backwards – is a Fuji Television programming block, devoted to anime, broadcast each Thursday night from 00:45 to 1:15. It was launched with the intention of expanding the target audience beyond the typical young male demographic.
The timeslot was expanded from half an hour to a full hour in 2010, and now airs Thursday nights from 00:45 to 1:45.
noitaminA aired its first non-anime series in 2010, with the premiere of the live-action adaptation of Moyashimon. On April 15, 2010, Fuji TV and FUNimation announced an agreement that allows FUNimation to simulcast series from the noitaminA block in North America within an hour of their airing in Japan.</description>

This anime`s main character is comparable to the gods themselves in terms of resistibility, strength and/or downright bad-assery.

<description>The third person fought by Shichika. Meisai wields Tsurugi, a thousand exact copies of one sword of Shikizaki`s doing. Meisai claims her real name was long forgotten. Her current name was taken from a priest she had killed. She was the daughter of a powerful kendo master, but died along with all his followers. She later became a bandit leader, inheriting Tsurugi through them. Her killing spree came to an end after meeting and killing the original Meisai Tsuruga. She is now the head of Sanzu shrine taking care of a group of mikos that have been abused by men to the point of killing almost any man. The thousand Tsurugi blades are used by her mikos and two bodyguards. She hopes that their supposed magical properties could cure the abused girls of their dangerous nature, which is worked to a small degree. Despite her willingness to surrender Tsurugi to Togame she is willing to fight for them for the sake of the girls. Her fighting style is called Sentouryuu, which revolves around using as many blades to her disposal, which Tsurugi provides.
She is killed by Shichika in one last stand after he tells her that she possesses the real Tsurugi out of the thousand and that it was fate that brought them together. Before dying she asks a favour of Togame in the case of her death she would want protection over the shrine and the girls from the shogunate, which Togame agrees to.</description>

<description>The name given to the katana Kanzashi, it fights Shichika in Volume 8 and Episode 8. It resides in an abandoned lake, attacking all that seem to threaten it. It`s frightfully fast, flexible, and armed with numerous blades, and it also has a blade hidden in its mouth. Throughout the episode Togame tries to study its behaviour as it only roams about through the deserted lake area. Despite their traps its fast thinking kicks in and is unaffected. Later confrontation, Shichika fights it, but proves to be a hassle as it blocks his attacks and surprises him with its unusual attack patterns. In one final attempt it uses its legs to propel itself into the air and attacks them from the sky. But Togame, foreseeing the lack of sunlight forces Byorigou to shut down and is rescued by Shichika before crashing down onto the ground. The doll is later sent to Princess Hitei.</description>
