<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="365884">This is my first review after a while, haha.
This anime is good, military and Europe settings reminds me a little about FMA.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="616461">PROS:
It excels in production values with beautiful artwork, animation, and soundtrack. 

It has some likable characters but the star of the show is by far Violet Evergarden. The self-contained stories in most of the episodes always help to further develop Violet in her understanding of human feelings and emotions. It is a very heartwarming drama anime that makes you want to be a better person.

 
CONS:
It is found guilty of falling into anime troupes and it can get cringy at times because of overdramatization.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="308171">I truly enjoyed this series. I recommend it to those who like to see character development. The ED is also a very moving piece.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="785227">If you are a fan of subtlety and visual story telling, this is the show for you.

Violet Evergarden is a beautiful series that explores the consequences of war and the complexities of human emotions. In my opinion, it is close to a masterpiece. However, there are a few shortcomings that are difficult to ignore. Below I listed my pros and cons for Violet Evergarden.

Pros:
Possibly the best production I have seen to date
Fantastic depiction of nonverbal communication and emotion
Wonderful music and careful detail to sound
Perfect if you`re a fan of "feels"

Cons:
Opening episodes requires a lot of patience
Slightly awkward character development
If you are not a fan of melodrama, won`t recommend

Overall, I highly recommend for viewers who enjoy a coming-of-age story. It is also the first anime to ever make me cry.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="173374">So sad, yet so beautiful ;) Must see!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="442930">I can`t say enough good things about this anime.  It excels in every category.  Absolutely a must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="31168">Watch this if you haven`t yet! The story progresses beautifully.
The animation is superb, and the soundtrack is my favourite this year so far that I listen to it almost every day at work. Easily 8/10 for me</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="728225">A beautiful art style coupled with a heart warming tale of a girl who learns to feel after participating in a war that numbed her feelings.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="540164">This one of those animes, that should be on everbodys list.  If you seriously love anime this one "Must be added to your list".  It`s not over for me, yet I look forward for the next episode.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="311037">The way Violet Evergarden conveys feelings through it`s seemingly simple premise of writing letters and a doll wanting to learn about love transcends beauty. It steps on the shoulder of archetypal stories such as Pinocchio and elevates the artform of Anime. I can`t recommend this enough!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="117590">This year was indeed splendid First Mahoutsukai no yome and now this marvel.

Even I had to swallow my tears and that happening can be counted on my fingers.
Apart from that graphics is stunning and characters tend to be deep.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="263947">If you don`t cry at least once during this series you are broken on the inside. This tugs on the heartstrings on even the most emotionally dense person.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="347772">The Art and story is something that left me breathless. I haven`t had an anime do that to me for some time. This has made it onto my list of must see.</recommendation>

<description>There are words http://anidb.net/ch89959 [Violet] heard on the battlefield, which she cannot forget. These words were given to her by http://anidb.net/ch90198 [someone she holds dear], more than anyone else. She does not yet know their meaning.
A certain point in time, in the continent of Telesis, the great war which divided the continent into North and South has ended after four years, and the people are welcoming a new generation.
Violet Evergarden, a young girl formerly known as "the weapon", has left the battlefield to start a new life at http://anidb.net/ch95401 [CH Postal Service]. There, she is deeply moved by the work of "http://anidb.net/t7105 [Auto Memories Dolls]", who carry people`s thoughts and convert them into words.
Violet begins her journey as an Auto Memories Doll, and comes face to face with various people`s emotions and differing shapes of love. All the while searching for the meaning of those words.

<name>military</name>
<description>The military, also known as the armed forces, are forces authorized and legally entitled to use deadly force so as to support the interests of the state and its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its citizens and the prosecution of war against foreign powers. The military may also have additional functions within a society, including construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding critical areas.

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>child soldier</name>
<description>Untrained and as yet immature, children are expediently thrust into the role of warriors to protect god, king, and country. Not having even finished school, they are inexplicably designated to elite status or roles, typically requiring months of training and years of experience. All the more so with "experimental" equipment or weapons of mass destruction.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<name>fictional language</name>
<description>Fictional languages are intended to be the languages of a fictional world and are often designed with the intent of giving more depth and an appearance of plausibility to the fictional worlds with which they are associated, and to have their characters communicate in a fashion which is both alien and dislocated.
Some of these languages, e.g. in worlds of fantasy fiction, alternative universes, Earth`s future, or alternate history, are presented as distorted versions or dialects of modern English or other natural language, while others are independently designed conlangs.
A fictional language often has the least amount of grammar and vocabulary possible, and rarely extends beyond the absolutely necessary. At the same time, some others have developed languages in detail for their own sake, such as J. R. R. Tolkien`s Quenya and Sindarin and Star Trek`s Klingon language which exist as functioning, usable languages. Here "fictional" can be a misnomer.</description>

<description>Rebellion, uprising, or insurrection is a refusal of obedience or order.

On the one hand the forms of behaviour can include non-violent methods such as the (overlapping but not quite identical) phenomena of civil disobedience, civil resistance and nonviolent resistance. On the other hand it may encompass violent campaigns. Those who participate in rebellions, especially if they are armed rebellions, are known as "rebels".&#13;

<name>predominantly adult cast</name>
<description>This show features mostly adults. That means children and teenagers are relatively rare and unlikely to hold significance to the plot.
That is a rare trait in anime, as most shows spin around children or teenagers.</description>

<name>episodic</name>
<description>An episodic anime consists of many successive short arcs that are generally 1-2 episodes in length, with strong plot continuity within each arc but generally little continuity from one arc to the next. For long shows (well upwards of 50 episodes), the episode count constraint is less tight; for example, a show with close to 250 episodes would also be considered episodic if it consisted of a majority of arcs of up to 3 or maybe 4 episodes and possibly also very few slightly longer arcs.</description>

<description>Luculia Marlborough is a graduate of the Auto Memories Doll Training School and a newbie Auto Memories Doll. She befriended Violet at the training school.
Luculia had a normal, yet very peaceful childhood with her parents and older brother, Spencer. When the war began, Spencer was drafted into the army. However, there wasn`t much fighting on the Western Front where Spencer was located, so Luculia claims that the war didn`t feel real to them. However, one day when her parents went to a town for business, the Western Front was broken through, and her parents were killed in the fighting.
After the war ended, Spencer came back alive, which was more than enough to make Luculia happy despite their parents` deaths. However, Spencer blamed himself for the deaths of their parents, and fell into depression and alcoholism, after which Luculia began taking care of him.

<description>Rhodanthe is the instructor at the Auto Memories Doll Training School.
She was the instructor when http://anidb.net/ch89959 [Violet] went there to become a full-fledged Doll. She explained the qualities an optimal Doll has to have to graduate from the school, and she would not do so if she did not deem the students worthy. She seemed to be quite astounded by Violet`s skills. But during a practice on the students actual ghostwriting skills on each other, Rhodanthe was unimpressed with the way Violet ghostwrote http://anidb.net/ch93417 [Luculia]`s letter, informing her that letters are an instrument for communicating a person`s feelings, and that letter she ghostwrote was unacceptable. However, upon being shown a letter Violet wrote for http://anidb.net/ch95266 [Luculia`s brother], she allowed Violet to graduate and congratulated her.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Charlotte Abelfreyja Drossel is the princess of the Kingdom of Drossel who is set to marry Damian, the prince of the neighboring Kingdom of Flugel.
When she turned ten, the Drossel kingdom threw a grand party to celebrate. For royalty, marriage arrangements officially begin when a child turns ten. Every single person she was arranged to meet was a prospective husband, and this fact made Charlotte sad since she felt like nobody really celebrated her birthday. The fact that her birthday didn`t feel like her birthday and the thought about her feelings not mattering, Charlotte sneaked out of the castle and let her emotions out by crying. That was the moment she met Damian Baldur Flugel. He ensured her that it was okay for her to cry, and he told her to cry all she wanted; he would be there for her. The fact that he spoke with her so casually with no motives, made Charlotte really happy and ever since that day, she couldn`t forget that moment.
After the war, Charlotte received a proposal out of nowhere, not revealed from who. Determined to make the marriage be between Drossel and Flugel, Charlotte began studying on all the benefits a marriage between the Flugel and Drossel countries would bring to the Drossel country. She also laid the groundwork with her father and the cabinet, and eventually, Drossel chose Flugel family.
On the request of the military, http://anidb.net/ch89959 [Violet] was sent to the kingdom of Drossel in order to write a public love letter for its princess, Charlotte, to Damian, the prince of the neighboring kingdom of Flugel, who also received help in writing letters from http://anidb.net/ch90197 [Cattleya]. During their exchange, Charlotte wanted to hear what prince Damian really thought about her and Violet decided to help her out. Thanks to that, they`ve confirmed their feelings for each other and eventually got married.

The first time Damian met Charlotte was outside the Drossel castle. She was crying due to her frustration that every man she met on her birthday would be a possible future husband for her. Damian told her that she came off as a sassy brat and was glad that she could cry too. He ensured her that it was okay for her to cry. The fact that he spoke with her so casually with no motives, made Charlotte really happy and ever since that day, she couldn`t forget that moment.

<description>The Auto Memories Doll Traning School is a preparatory school located in Leiden, for women who want to work as Auto Memories Doll. This serves as some sort of a school which lasts for a couple of weeks, as the students get to polish their skills as a Doll, receives grades and gets to graduate if deemed worthy. The instructor of the school is http://anidb.net/ch95271 [Rhodanthe].
After the war, the demand for Dolls grew rapidly and the writing industry became larger. It is possible to become a Doll without attending the school, but the objective of the school if not just to train any kind of Doll; it is to train the people to become the best Doll one can be. Graduating from the school is a proof of someone who is worthy of the Auto Memories Doll title, and if one manages to graduate, they will also receive a brooch in a proof of excellence. However, it is a strict school with high standards, so if the instructor does not deem someone worthy, they will not be given the certification.

<description>CH Postal Company is the company founded by http://anidb.net/ch90199 [Claudia Hodgins], who also acts as its current president.
It was founded after the war due to increasing number of people who wanted to send letters but didn`t know how to write or otherwise weren`t able to. Since the government`s postal service didn`t address the civilians` needs, Hodgins thought it would be a great opportunity to create such company. Shortly after, company had plenty of employees and became well-known around the country.</description>
