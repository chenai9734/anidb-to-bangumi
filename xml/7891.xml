<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<description>Any anime that is based on a role-playing game aka RPG. A role-playing video game is a video game which includes elements of non-electronic role-playing games. The player assumes control of one or several fictional characters (a party) who have joined forces in order to perform quests and overcome a great number of challenges and enemies, usually monsters inspired by fantasy, and, to a lesser extent, science fiction and classic mythology. During the course of the game the characters, or avatars, which are generally defined by quantized characteristics, evolve and improve in that their various attributes increase, as well as by gaining more powerful artefacts.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>adventure</name>
<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<description>In our terms, a proxy battle is a battle where humans use creatures/robots to do the fighting for them, either by commanding those creatures/robots or by simply evolving them/changing them into battle mode. Often the training aspect is also involved, or in some cases the proxies are nothing more than holographic representatives of some other variation of competition (like for example a card game). While many popular shounen anime fit under this category, it`s not limited to shounen anime.</description>

<description>In a series based around an endless series of one-on-one fights, defeating a Worthy Opponent or The Rival will sometimes convert them to the hero`s side, if not always to his cause. 
Furthermore, no matter how many people the Worthy Opponent has killed, how much grief he has caused, even if he slaughtered helpless children or the hero`s own family, as soon as he shows a bit of remorse or goes out of his way to help the hero even once, he will be welcomed into the hero`s circle of True Companions with open arms.

<description>The most common example is that of a voice, either that of one of the characters or entirely unrelated, that appears at the beginning of an episode to offer a summary or introduction, and at the end of an episode for closure or for a preview to hint upon what to expect next.
Another use of narration comes in the form of a dominant voice belonging to one of the protagonists, intended only for the viewer and revealing the intimate thoughts to whom it belongs. This type of narration occurs frequently throughout the duration of the episode or movie.</description>

<description>No end in sight!
No matter what the genre may be or what the storyline consists of, this series just keeps on going... and on... and on.
The obvious downside to this is the lack of story-related focus, usually some vague goal is simply never reached. This lack of conclusion can tend to annoy, making the whole series pretty much pointless.
Examples: One Piece, Naruto, Bleach, Detective Conan, Dragon Ball (Z), or Pocket Monsters (Pokemon).</description>

<description>A typical plot or sub-plot for many shows. Either the cast or somebody else, that being often the main antagonist, embarks on a quest to collect things, shiny things. Things that are said to grant simple wishes or even do miracles like bringing people back to life, destroying the whole world, galaxy, universe and in rare cases turning the hero into the greatest Pokemon Master. Those things can be weapons, lost technology, magical artefacts, pieces of a giant magical artefact and in some cases even people or little critters.

<description>An episodic anime consists of many successive short arcs that are generally 1-2 episodes in length, with strong plot continuity within each arc but generally little continuity from one arc to the next. For long shows (well upwards of 50 episodes), the episode count constraint is less tight; for example, a show with close to 250 episodes would also be considered episodic if it consisted of a majority of arcs of up to 3 or maybe 4 episodes and possibly also very few slightly longer arcs.</description>

<description>Tauros is a bull known for its violent urges and rowdy, aggressive disposition in general, as supplied by a tremendous amount of natural stamina. Any given Tauros finds it impossible to keep up its spirits in life without near-constant rampaging. It always tries to find opponent Pokémon to battle outright to serve this purpose, but if it is alone, it will instead concentrate on charging at and knocking down thick trees to calm itself. By locking horns with other Tauros, it fights to assert dominance in a herd. The protector of the herd is usually noted by battle torn horns. As Tauros is based on a bull, it is a male-only Pokémon; its female equivalent is the more cowlike Miltank.
Tauros has a special habit that specifically affects its ability to battle, both in the wild and in trainer-directed Pokémon battles: It whips itself with its three long snapping tails. When it targets an enemy, it heightens its will to battle by whipping its own backside with its tails before charging at full speed.
In the anime, Ash Ketchum captures a herd of thirty Tauros in the Safari Zone (though the episode which features this was banned in America due to its flagrant gun use and politically incorrect humor). They usually remain in Professor Oak`s fields, Ash occasionally picks one up for various tournaments or important battles.</description>

<description>Kabuto is an extinct Pokémon that can be revived through dome fossils, though some living examples have been found. Remaining unchanged for 300 million years, it is an aquatic Pokémon that hides on the sea floor, which is how some Kabuto became fossils in the first place. While concealed, Kabuto leaves exposed only its hard shell, which protects it from any attacks, while the glowing eyes on its back allow it to continue monitoring its surroundings. If it is flipped upside down, it becomes helpless and defenseless as it is unable to flip over on its own. According to the anime, oil extracted from a Kabuto is rumored to have interesting medical properties, longevity being one of them.</description>

<description>Dragonite is the final form of the Dratini evolutionary line. It evolves from Dragonair at level 55. Dragonite`s appearance is notably different from that of its previous forms. As Dragonite, it is now a golden bipedal dragon with a beige underbelly that extends from the top of its neck to the tip of its tail. Along with already being a Dragon-type, it has now gained the secondary Flying-type, growing wings. Dragonite is one of the fastest flying Pokémon, and "The fastest flying Pokémon" as of the first generation. It has a small horn on the top of its head, along with slightly "S" shaped antennae. However, much like its previous forms, Dragonite still has a gentle and somewhat innocent appearance. Its diet consists mainly of berries, soft plants, and fruit, while it will occasionally eat crustaceans, like Corphish and Krabby.
Dragonite are very loyal to any trainer they find worthy of acceptance. They are calm, gentle, and intelligent creatures, but when threatened can put their pudgy bulk to good use. Dragonite seem to have more advanced vocal abilities compared to other Pokémon in that they make several different types of calls, rather than just saying their name. They have been noted to save drowning swimmers and threatened sailors. Dragonites` speed is very varied; some Dragonite can have great speeds while other have very low/average speeds. It is said that Dragonite can circle the globe in less than 16 hours.
Dragonite`s main anime appearance was at the end of the Orange Island League season in "Enter The Dragonite". It was spotted twice in the previous episode "Hello Pummelo" as Ash, Tracy and Misty saw it flying over the sea around Pummelo Island and they learned that it was owned by the "Orange Crew" leader, Drake. It also defeated Team Rocket as they tried to steal Dragonite. In Ash`s six on six battle with Drake, it defeated Ash`s Charizard with Dragon Rage, Squirtle with Thunder and Tauros with Thunder before Ash`s Pikachu took it out with a Thunder of its own. While none of Ash`s Pokémon were strong enough to defeat Dragonite on their own, their combined attacks steadily weakened it to the point of exhaustion, allowing Pikachu to finally defeat it. Drake keeps Dragonite`s Poké Ball on a necklace. Professor Oak also owns a Dragonite and was used prior to the episode "The Mastermind of Mirage Pokémon". It also appeared in Pokémon: The First Movie, when it was sent by Mewtwo to give Ash and his friends an invitation. It also appeared in the beginning of Ash`s journey when he encountered Bill. Here, Dragonite was described as an unknown legendary Pokémon by the Pokédex, and because it was nighttime the colour of its skin couldn`t be seen.</description>

It can easily change the landscape with its strength, often causing maps to have to be redrawn if it rampages. It can destroy a whole mountain with one arm, just to make its nest. It has an insolent nature towards all other beings, and due to its own the toughness of its body, it seeks out opponents constantly.</description>

<description>Spheal is a spherical creature that rolls across ice floes because its body isn`t cut out for swimming. Spheal, in spite of its infancy, is fully capable of living in Arctic environments such as a tundra. Though it is not obvious, its body is fully covered in a layer of plushy fur that feels fluffy to the touch. This is surprisingly good at insulating Spheal against the cold when it is rolling about on ice floes or diving into the sea, for it apparently never feels the cold at all. When groups of Spheal eat, they instinctively show their pleasure by clapping and making other noises.</description>

Its flippers are quite powerful: they are strong enough to shatter ice with well-placed flaps. Five times a day, Sealeo dives into the sea to hunt prey.
Sealeo`s behavior revolves mostly around its sensitive nose; Sealeo uses it to investigate new things. It lifts new objects up with its nose, and rolls them around. While rolling an object, Sealeo checks the object`s aroma and texture in order to learn about it. This is what it does to differentiate food from anything else, making it a vital ability for survival. However, Sealeo also takes a liking to balancing and spinning a younger Spheal on its nose for entertainment.</description>

<description>Staravia live in enormous flocks like its pre-evolution, Starly. While in the flocks, it constantly searches fields and forests for bug Pokémon. Flocks often fight when confronted with each other.
Staravia resembles a White-cheeked Starling. Its most prominent feature is the curled crest on its head, similar to that of a lapwing. It has a black and orange colored beak like a quail. The name Staravia derives from the English words starling and avian. Staravia`s Japanese name, Mukubird, is a portmanteau of the Japanese word for White-cheeked Starling (椋鳥, mukudori) and the English word bird.
In the anime, Ash`s Starly evolved into Staravia, and is frequently used in battles with Ash.</description>

<description>Lickilicky, known as the Licking Pokémon, is one of several Pokémon of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl that evolve from a Pokémon from a previous generation, Lickitung. It does so when it knows the move Rollout and levels up, but only in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. This fact makes it one of only four Pokémon (the others being Mamoswine, Tangrowth, and Yanmega) that evolve from a previously obtainable Pokémon in a way that would have been possible in previous games: by learning a certain move. Not much else can be discerned from Lickilicky`s pre-evolved form, except it can learn Explosion, meaning that it is the only Pokémon (besides Smeargle through its unique Sketch move) that can learn Explosion and receive a Same Type Attack Bonus from it as well. It has a bizarre, rather swirly protusion on its head resembling hair. Lickilicky also has thumb spikes, and a white bib-like pattern on its chest in front of the neck. This design may be based on old 60-70`s diner mascots.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Sakaki is the head of Team Rocket, and formerly served as the Gym Leader of Viridian City`s Gym, known officially as the Viridian Gym. He handed out the Earth Badge to Trainers who defeated him. As a Gym Leader, he specialized in Ground-type Pokémon, but his master plan includes collecting rare Pokémon of all types.
Very little is known about his past in any timeline; he is generally shrouded in mystery. However, certain things are known:
His mother was the head of Team Rocket before him. However, this is presumed to be canon in the anime timeline only, as the games have no precedent for this.
While Sakaki very rarely takes the role of antagonist, his agents often have him in mind during missions due to the chance of power, be it through promotion or other means. This gave him a unique series of appearances, mainly during the Hoenn saga, where Nyarth often saw how the Pokémon in each episode could be used to help Sakaki and win the trio promotions. These boss fantasies never show his actual personality and occasionally even show Sakaki in chibi form.
The only time Sakaki has been seen in battle was in The Battle for the Badge. He used powerful Pokémon against Shigeru but later left the Gym to deal with an unexplained emergency, leaving Satoshi to battle Musashi. By the time Satoshi returned from Hoenn, Agatha was in charge of the Gym until a new leader could be found. Sakaki`s reasons for leaving it have not been explained, though it is speculated to be linked with the events of the aforementioned episode.
Sakaki is one of the three most prominent figures speculated to be Satoshi`s father, alongside Professor Okido and Silver. There is no evidence to support this, though Diamondshippers see Sakaki`s avoidance of Satoshi mentioned above as suspicious. In Pokémon Live!, it was claimed that Sakaki and Delia had shared a relationship as teenagers, though it is also stated that someone else is Satoshi`s father in that particular canon.</description>

<description>Jessie is one half of of the Team Rocket duo that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokemon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
Jessie`s mother, Miyamoto, was a high-ranking Team Rocket agent. When Jessie was around the age of three, Miyamoto left on a mission to the Andes Mountains to record the voice of the elusive Pokemon Mew. However, Miyamoto disappeared, and Jessie was put into a foster home which had very little money. There were times when she had no choice but to eat snow because of a lack of more nourishing food.
When she was old enough, she left home to become a Pokemon nurse in Jouto. However, the school she was enrolled in was literally for Pokemon nurses (i.e. Chansey), so she failed to graduate and left, leaving behind a Chansey she had befriended there. It is assumed that she then traveled back to Kanto, where she enrolled in Pokemon Tech, a trainer`s school, met James, and subsequently failed and dropped out. After this, Jessie and James joined a bicycle gang in Sunny Town, where Jessie was known for swinging a chain above her head as she rode her bike (nicknamed "Chainer Jess").
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between Jessie and James after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Sometime before joining Team Rocket, and it is not known when, Jessie obtained a Contest Pass in the Hoenn region. Also during the years before Team Rocket, she had several boyfriends, all of whom left her and/or treated her badly. In "Xatu the Future", she revealed that she had once worked at a T.V. station as the Weathergirl. In "From Cradle to Save" is also revealed that she once was a ninja.
She has a long-standing bitter rivalry with Cassidy, another member of Team Rocket. Another member, Wendy, held a grudge against Jessie for failing to pay for a drink (making Wendy pay), but got her revenge when she added the charge to Jessie`s overall Team Rocket bill.
In the episode "Ignorance is Blissey", Jessie was reunited with her friend Chansey from the Pokemon nurse school; Chansey had since evolved into a Blissey.
Starting in Hoenn, Jessie has become a Pokemon Coordinator, entering every contest that she could. She frequently makes it to the battle round, but usually loses there. However, in "Borrowing on Bad Faith", she finally succeeded in winning an (unofficial) contest by using Ash`s Aipom, which she had saved earlier in the episode. And, in "Team Shocker!", she finally wins an official contest with her Dustox in at Solaceon City. Later she also won a ribbon with help of her Yanmega. She has Contest Passes to compete in the Hoenn, Kanto, and Sinnoh regions.
While Jessie`s role in the Pokemon anime has not yet ended, in Toshihiro Ono`s manga, "The Electric Tale of Pikachu", she ended up married to James and with child.
Jessie seems to have a special preference for snake-like Pokemon, owning both an Arbok and a Seviper. In "The Ninja Poke Showdown", she expressed a preference for Poison-type Pokemon in general.
For unknown reasons, she, James and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation.
In the Kanto contests, Jessie disguises herself as Jessebella (which is similar to James former fiancee Jessiebelle) wearing a red dress and glasses. Eventually, Ash, Brock, Max and May finds out her true identity at the last contest.
During the Kanto Grand Festival, Jessie dresses up as Jessadia (Japanese: キャンディ・ムサリーナ Candy Musalina). and wears glasses, long white socks, a yellow and orange dress, and has her hair in pigtails. She works there as an announcer and Lilian Meridian`s assistant; Lilian herself says she may not really like "Jessadia"`s style, but recognizes her talent. In the Latin American dub, she enters Super Contests under the name Jessiebella (referencing Jessiebelle again). Jessie currently still continues to use the Jessalina disguise while participating in Super Contests.
In "Pruning a Passel of Pals!" and "Strategy With a Smile!" she once again used her Jessadia disguise to report on the Wallace Cup.
Although Jessie had entered mostly every contest in Hoenn &amp; Kanto, she lost in every single one, whether it was the first match of the Battle Rounds or the finals. But in the Sinnoh Region, she has so far won 2 ribbons using her Dustox and Yanmega.</description>

<description>Meowth is a very unique Pokémon as it has many of the characteristics of a human. It walks on two feet, talks and is as smart as any human. Meowth is currently a member of Team Rocket and he travels around with Jessie and James trying to capture Pikachu and other rare Pokémon for Giovanni.
Meowth generally finishes his sentences with "Nyaa (ニャー)" which is the equivalent of "meow" in English. This helps people remember that despite his ability to talk like a human, he still has cat character traits.
Meowth is also known for coming up with his many schemes to try to capture Pikachu. While Jessie and James always agree with Meowth and think his plans are brilliant, they are generally foiled by Ash and his friends.
Long Con to Access Raimon City Pokémon Center
Meowth schemed with Jessie, James and Doctor Zager to figure out a way for them to infiltrate the Raimon City Pokémon Center where high-leveled Pokémon are stored in a vault that is protected by a security machine scan system that would only open if Nurse Joy (Isshu) or Nurse Joy`s Audino were scanned. Meowth pretended to be no longer part of Team Rocket making up a story that his made an error while executing a certain operation and when headquarters hear of his mistake, they told him he was fired.
Ash, Iris and Cilan believed him and allowed Meowth to travel with him. Pikachu though didn`t trust Meowth even though Meowth proved on numerous occasion that it should be trusted. Meowth`s plan was put into action when they arrived at the Raimon City Pokémon Center and as soon as Nurse Joy`s Audino was scanned to open the door, Meowth turned on Pikachu and the other and captured all the Pokémon in the vault. The long con had been a success and Meowth met up with Jessie and James below the Pokémon Center. Unfortunately, they weren`t able to get away as Ash and his friends realized that Meowth had just been conning them and they were able to stop Team Rocket.</description>

<description>James is one part of of the Team Rocket trio that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokémon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
James is mostly a comedic parody of bishounen characters; the English dub in particular tends to give him a melodramatic and even campy tone. He is somewhat famous for carrying a rose, though in more recent episodes he does not display it often. Mostly, his rose is displayed in the Team Rocket motto.
The only child of millionaires, James was forced to endure formal society. At a young age, he was forcefully engaged to a girl of whom he was terrified, Jessiebelle, all because his parents wanted to have a wealthy daughter-in-law. Thus, he ran away from home, leaving behind his beloved pet Growlie. He attempted to enroll in Pokémon Tech, a trainer`s school, but, along with his new friend Jessie, flunked out. Then, with Jessie, he joined the Sunny Town bicycle gang, where he was popular for being the only gang member to have to use training wheels (nicknamed "Trainer Jim"). Eventually James, Jessie, and the bike gang went their separate ways.
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between James and Jessie after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Since he is proficient in several activities, including Pokémon haiku and PokéRinger, it is possible that he developed his skills during his temporary separation from Jessie, but this is not known for sure.
In the episode "Holy Matrimony!", James returned to his home as a result of a trap by his parents, who pretended to be dead. He was reunited with his old pet Growlie and managed to avoid marrying Jessiebelle. Growlie stayed behind when James returned to Jessie and Meowth.
James has a tendency to be swindled by a Magikarp Salesman, who has on many occasions tricked him into buying a Magikarp or other useless Pokémon and items for large sums of money.
James also has a tendency to cross-dress, but has not done it since "Pros and Con Artists". He does, however, dress up like famous celebrities as well, such as Professor Oak, Juan, and Norman.
James loves rare bottle caps and has an impressive collection of them. In the episode "All That Glitters!" it is revealed that he has "drunk enough soda pop to float an aircraft carrier".
For unknown reasons, he, Jessie and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation. However in newer episodes the balloon is shown with `jets` attached to explain how they get from one place to another faster than walking.</description>

<description>The Beginning
Ash is the main character of the Pokémon anime. Raised in Pallet Town, he started his journey to become a Pokémon Master at the age of 10. On the day that he started his journey, Ash carelessly woke up late despite being told by his mother, Delia Ketchum to get to bed. He rushed to Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory only to find out that the beginner Pokémon - Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander - had already been given out to trainers who arrived on time. However, Professor Samual Oak mentioned that there was one more Pokémon available - Pikachu. Despite constantly hitting Ash with Electric-type attacks and refusing to return to its PokéBall, Ash decided to take Pikachu along with him on his journey to become a Pokémon Master. Pikachu is cold towards Ash at first and laughs at his failures; however, when Ash saves Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow, he begins to warm up to his new trainer and the two finally become friends. After the battle with the flock of Spearow, a Ho-Oh is seen flying towards a rainbow in the sky. The PokéDex reveals that the Ho-Oh is an unidentified Pokémon. Thus, the journey of Ash and Pikachu begins.
Captures in Viridian Forest
While making his way towards Pewter City and his first Kanto League Gym Battle, Ash came upon a wild Caterpie deep within Viridian Forest. Instead of using Pikachu to battle against the wild Pokémon, Ash took his chances and threw a PokéBall without weakining the Caterpie first. Luckily, he was able to catch the Pokémon without any trouble. The capture of Ash`s Caterpie marked Ash`s first capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Caterpie the second Pokémon to join his team.
The next day, while continuing the trek through the Viridian Forest, Ash came up on a wild Pidgeotto. He tried to just throw a PokéBall like he did with Ash`s Caterpie, but Pidgeotto swatted the PokéBall away. Misty informed that he must weaken the Pokémon first before attempting to capture it. He called out Ash`s Caterpie to battle against, but Misty quickly informed him that Bug-type Pokémon are weak against Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeotto. After Pidgeotto dealt significant damage to Ash`s Caterpie, Ash recalled it and sent out Pikachu. Pikachu was able to use its Thundershock to weaken Pidgeotto and allow Ash to capture it with a PokéBall. Thus, this capture marked Ash`s second capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Pidgeotto the third Pokémon to join his team.
Later on, while still in the Viridian Forest, Ash was approached by Team Rocket, who attempted to steal his Pokémon. After defeating Meowth, James`s Koffing, and Jessie`s Ekans, Ash`s Caterpie evolved into Ash`s Metapod.
Some of Ash`s greatest accomplishments have been at the various Pokémon Leagues. He was the victor at the Orange League and the Battle Frontier. He also competed in the Indigo League and the Johto Silver Conference where he placed admirably in both those competitions as well.
Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup
Ash participated in the Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup at the Kagome Town stadium. In the first round he was in the fifth match and faced off against Marris. The match was quickly showcased and Ash won the battle and advanced to the second round while Marris was eliminated from the tournament.
The Isshu League
Ash participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where he was matched up against Trip. Trip`s Serperior was sent out to battle Pikachu and Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior`s speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter Trip`s Serperior speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round. The two met in the Pokémon Center after the battle, and Trip vowed that the next time they met that he would win. The two shook hands and parted ways.
In the first main round, Ash`s opponent was shown on the match up electronic board but not much else is known about the battle. Ash`s Scraggy participated in the second main round of the Isshu League tournament where it faced off against a Darumakka. It was able to defeat it so that moved on to the next round.
In the third round, Stephan was matched up against Ash. Cilan noted that the two of them have a very direct taste and that it would be a good battle. It was only a 3 on 3 battle but the both of them gave it their all. The first two battles of the third round setup the final match up of Stephan`s Sawk vs Ash`s Krookodile, both of which were very injured from the previous battles. Both of them did their best to muster up their reserve strength but in the end a surprise move of Aerial Ace by Ash`s Krookodile was super effective against Stephan`s Sawk and it knocked it out to give Ash the victory while eliminating Stephan from the tournament. Stephan realized after the battle that the reason that Ash withdrew Waruvial after the first battle was because Ash knew that Stephan would definitely send out Dageki, so he didn`t reveal that it knew Aerial Ace and saved until the end.</description>

<description>The Beginning
On the morning that Ash was to start his Pokémon journey, he woke up late and by the time he reached Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory, all of the beginner Pokémon were already taken. However, Professor Samual Oak did have one Pokémon left, a wild Pikachu. At first, Pikachu did not like Ash and would refuse to enter his PokéBall. He would often laugh at Ash`s failures and refused to listen to him. However, after Ash proved his loyalty to Pikachu by protecting him from a flock of Spearow, and thus began to earn Pikachu`s trust and respect. The two have since become best friends and Pikachu never leaves Ash`s side.
Since the day Team Rocket first encountered Pikachu, it has been their sole goal to capture it. Day after day, their plan to capture Pikachu has been thwarted mainly due to Pikachu`s amazingly powerful Thunderbolt that keeps on blasting them off.
On numerous occasions, Pikachu has made it evident that he is happy being a Pikachu and has no desire to evolve into a more powerful Raichu. It has proven time and time again that it is a powerful and worthy opponent to any Pokémon that dares to battle it.
Gym Battle against Burgh`s Leavanny
Pikachu was then sent out to battle Burgh`s Leavanny. Burgh`s Leavanny managed to tie up Pikachu with String Shot but unlike Ash`s Swadloon who was able to break free, Pikachu ended up getting hit with a couple of Leaf Storm attacks and a Hyper Beam before it rolled into another of Burgh`s Leavanny`s Leaf Storm attacks to break the string off its body so it could attack. Freed from the String Shot, Burgh`s Leavanny tried to tie it up again but Pikachu managed to avoid it with its speed and then knocked Burgh`s Leavanny out with a combination of Iron Tail and Electro Ball.
Gym Battle against Elesa
Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy and was then matched up with Pikachu. Pikachu made quick work of Elesa`s Emolga and knocked it out with one attack, its Iron Tail.
Elesa`s Tynamo was the last Pokémon that she used in her gym battle against Ash. It was matched up against Pikachu who had just defeated her Emonga. Pikachu had a hard time defending against the fast Tackle attack that Elesa`s Tynamo kept hitting it with but Pikachu used its Thunderbolt to create a large dust cloud leaving only a small corridor for Pikachu to focus on it and so Elesa`s Tynamo couldn`t maneuver out of the way. Pikachu one hit K.O`d Elesa`s Tynamo with a Iron Tail. The loss gave Ash the overall victory.
Battle against Alder`s Bouffalant
Ash challenged Alder to a battle and he accepted though he had been walking all night and was actually quite tired. Alder sent out his Buffron to battle Pikachu but just as the battle started, Alder fell asleep standing up and didn`t give any orders to his Buffron. Alder`s Bouffalant stood still as Pikachu began hitting it with attack after attack until it Alder`s Bouffalant finally got mad at Alder and charged at him and set him flying into a tree. After that, Alder`s Bouffalant no longer wished to battle and Alder conceded the battle.
Gym Battle against Skyla
In Skyla air battle simulation, Ash`s Tranquill was matched up against Skyla`s Unfezant and since her Pokémon was the highest evolved form, she determined that her Pokémon would be the winner in that match-up. In the actual gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was up against Skyla`s Unfezant which was the match-up just after Ash`s Tranquill had defeated Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla`s Unfezant proved to be stronger and faster than Ash`s Tranquill, so Ash recalled it and set out Pikachu. Pikachu had a definite advantage over Skyla`s Unfezant with its electric attacks and it quickly knocked it out with its Electro Ball attack.
Ash Just after Pikachu ended up knocking out Skyla`s Unfezant, Skyla`s Swanna was sent out to battle against it. Skyla had been watching her grandpa`s battle videos and noticed that he used the move Aqua Ring to defend against Electric attacks. She used that same defense against Pikachu which nullified its Electric attacks. It`s Iron Tail also couldn`t hit it so high in the air. Ash then noticed the rings in the air and Pikachu jumped up on them and managed to hit Skyla`s Swanna but not directly. Pikachu was now up in the air though and Skyla`s Swanna had the advantage there and it quickly knocked Pikachu out with a powerful Brave Bird attack.
Battle Against Trip`s Serperior at the Isshu League
Pikachu participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where it is was matched up against Trip`s Serperior. Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter its speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round.</description>

<description>He is a Pokémon researcher that was once a competitive Trainer, and is generally considered the best in his field. As such, his role in the Pokémon games and anime is that of a mentor to young Pokémon Trainers, a source of information and an occasional plot device. Amongst other things, he is credited with inventing the Pokédex. He also hands out a Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander to beginning trainers (depending on which Pokémon the trainer chooses) to start their adventure in the Kanto Region. Although he is an expert on all matters relating to Pokémon, Professor Oak specializes in Pokémon behavioural science. He appears in Pokémon 4Ever as a child who was pulled into the future by Celebi. Additionally, it is apparent after Pokémon 3: The Movie that he knew Delia Ketchum since she was a child; this most likely is the reason he occasionally exhibits parental-type concern (mainly in the form of scolding Ash as he is doing something that is dangerous). He also creates poems centred around Pokémon and is known as the rhyming professor by Dawn.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>While traveling in the Isshu region just outside of Kanako Town, Ash mistakenly thought Iris was a Pokémon and threw a monster ball at her. Ash thought she was a Axew as the Zukan displayed the data for it. Her Axew appeared out of her large hair moments later though. After learning that Cilan was going to be traveling with Ash through the Isshu region, Iris decided that she would travel with them as well but she said that her goal on this journey was a secret.
In the games, Iris is one of the gym leaders of Souryuu City`s Gym but it is currently unknown if she holds the same title in the anime.
Displeasure of Ice Pokémon
Just before Ash and Trip`s three-on-three battle, Iris encountered Trip`s Vanillite. She instantly tried to avoid it and started to shiver. She explained that since Dragon types have a disadvantage against Ice types, she dislike the cold that Ice Pokémon create. Trip tried to confront her about her dislike of Ice Pokémon by telling her that Dragon Pokémon are also strong against Dragon Pokémon but she only reluctantly apologized to Trip`s Vanillite and her mind wasn`t truly changed.
Making up with Excadrill
Excadrill didn`t always want to obey Iris when its asked to do something. For awhile, it was stubborn but Iris`s Excadrill was able to overcome the feelings of resentment and lost of trust it felt from the battle against Drayden`s Haxorus. After relating her experience to Ash and Cilan, it became more clear to Iris that she was not fully understanding her Excadrill`s feelings. Iris apologized to her Excadrill as she finally realized that her Excadrill knew after the first hit during the battle against Drayden`s Haxorus that they couldn`t win against it. The two of them then practiced all through the night until Excadrill was finally able to successfully launch the Focus Blast.
Rival Langley
While on route to Raimon City, Iris encountered Georgia, a Dragon Buster who once had a battle in the Dragon Village and her Pokémon was beaten up and now has it out for anyone from the village. Georgia managed to coax Iris into a battle but Iris`s Axew was no match for Georgia`s Beartic and Georgia ended up intimidating and angering Iris by saying the victory was easy and boring. Iris though was determined to defeat her new rival and during the rematch battle she managed to end it in a draw.
Don Battles
Iris entered the Don Battles, a battle tournament to be held in Raimon Town, with her friends and rivals. Jimmy Ray was easily defeated in the first round by Iris.
Stephan`s Sawk battled against Iris`s Emolga in the second round of the Don George Battle Tournament in Raimon Town but Emonga`s Static ability proved to be the deciding factor in the match. The Static ability ended up paralyzing Stephan`s Sawk and it was then a sitting target for Iris`s Emolga`s Volt Switch which knocked it out. Iris`s Emolga`s win eliminated Stephan from the tournament.
Iris`s Axew and Luke`s Golett were matched up in the semi-final round of the Don Battles in Raimon Town. Luke`s Golett dominated most of the battle and just as Iris`s Axew was about to be defeated, it learned the move Outrage. Outrage was able to do significant damage to Luke`s Golett and it knocked it out which eliminated Luke from the tournament.
In the finals, Iris battled against Ash and though it was a close battle, Iris`s Excadrill had the type advantage against Pikachu and she won the tournament. For winning, Iris received the beautiful seven-feather "Top-Class Driftveil Wing Set," containing Health, Muscle, Resist, Genius, Clever, Swift, and Pretty Wings which she sent to Dragon Village via Pidove Shipping Service.
Day Care Monozu
In BW58, befriended a shy and lonely Monozu that was awaiting its Trainer to return. As Monozu`s are a Dragon Type Pokémon, Iris was instantly excited to spend time with it. It took her awhile to gain its trust though. Iris recalled an event to Monozu that she witnessed in the Dragon Village where she saw Elder befriend a Crimgan that got lost and somehow found its way into the Village. The Crimgan absolutely refused to get along with other Dragon types and the people of the Village. For days and days, the Crimgan wouldn`t come out from deep within the cave. The Elder waited for Crimgan at the entrance of the cave the whole time and she tried to make the Crimgan open its heart to her, by talking to it like the way Iris was talking to Monozu to gain its trust and friendship. After several days had passed, Crimgan came out of the cave. All the Elder had done was talk to it and still, she managed to free it from its insecurities.
Iris uses the same technique that Elder used and the shy Monozu became more open with Iris and the two of them became friends. Iris spent a few days with the Monozu as they awaited the Trainer to return. At one point, Iris suggested to the Monozu if its Trainer didn`t return that it could come with her. The Trainer did return though and Monozu left with it but not before it gave Iris its biggest smile.
Fukiyose Tower Bell of Wishes Festival
Stephan met up with Iris and her friends and informed them of the Fukiyose Tower Bell of Wishes Festival that he was going to participate in. After hearing from him that it was an awesome event held once a year at the Fukiyose Tower, Iris and her friends decided to enter the tournament with Stephan.
Iris and Iris`s Axew paired up for the tournament. In the scavenger hunt, Iris asked Cilan to lent her his fishing rod so she could advance to the next round. In the tub race, Iris`s Axew used Dragon Rage on the surface of the water to propel them to the next round. During the imitation competition, iris was forced to dress-up as Professor Juniper and Miles thought she did quite well and he advanced her to the next round. In the forest of trials, Iris thought she had won but Chandela`s Confuse Ray affected her and she was in the middle of the forest for the entire race and was therefore eliminated from the tournament.
Rematch Battle against Drayden at the Soryu Gym
Having accepted the challenge to battle at the Dragon Village, Iris met up with Drayden to have a rematch battle. He heard about Iris getting into trouble again by climbing the Soryu Tower but told here to eat something and have a rest while he had a school meeting and then they would have their battle.
During the battle, Drayden was evaluating how much Iris had grown and he noticed that Iris`s Excadrill power certainly seemed to have improved. The matchup between Iris`s Excadrill and Drayden`s Haxorus ended up in a draw as the two of them knocked each other out. In the matchup between, Drayden`s Druddigon and Iris` Dragonite, Drayden noted that Iris` Dragonite had had an interesting life during its past. Iris` Dragonite wanted to fight under the same conditions as Drayden`s Druddigon, who cannot fly. Everyone thought that Iris was doing well in the battle but Drayden`s Druddigon proved to be more powerful than they had anticipated. Drayden`s Druddigon knocked out Iris` Dragonite with a powerful Dragon Tail attack to give Drayden the victory in the rematch battle. Cilan thought Iris had cornered him, but Drayden was still a few steps ahead. Drayden was trying to get a clear picture of Iris by drawing out their power.
Drayden complemented Iris on making good friends and he realized that sending her off on a journey was the right thing to do. He could tell that she had grown up but standing still wasn`t good for her. He told her to strengthen herself even further, become stronger and grow and then visit him again.</description>

<description>Axew, known as the Tusk Pokémon. It is a bipedal, greenish-colored Pokémon with noticeable nostrils and pale tusks protruding from the sides of its mouth. It was described by IGN as a "baby parasaurolophus". It leaves gashes on trees and shrubs with its tusks in order to mark its territory and is capable of immediately regrowing broken tusks.
In the Pokémon anime, Iris owns an Axew, which was introduced in "Enter Iris and Axew!". She carries it in her extensive hair, rather than in a Poké Ball (similar to Ash`s Pikachu).
Game Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava stated "I kind of dig Axew", saying he looks "pretty cute", and "his stance says he`s ready for anything".</description>

<description>Snivy, known as the Grass Snake Pokémon, is one of the starter Pokémon in the Pokémon Black and White versions. Its arms and tails are similar to a palmate tree with three prongs, respectively. A Snivy uses its tail to process photosynthesis, and if it loses energy, its tail sags gradually. When charged up with sun`s energy, its movement speed sharpens. Snivy is known to behave accordingly in situations. In an interview with Ken Sugimori, he explained that Snivy was based on snakes that look like vines, and would have an aristocrat-like personality. He also stated that Snivy`s evolution would be Western style of design.
It was first revealed as a silhouette on the May 9, 2010, episode of Pokémon Sunday. In the anime, Snivy was first seen in "In the Shadow of Zekrom" as the starter Pokémon of Trip, a beginner trainer in the Unova region. In "Snivy Plays Hard to Catch", Ash Ketchum also encounters a female Snivy and successfully captures her. Snivy is also featured along with the other starter Pokémon in the Pokémon Adventures manga as one of the starters in Professor Juniper`s lab. Snivy is Monta`s starter Pokémon in the Pokémon Master Black &amp; White manga.
In a poll by Official Nintendo Magazine, it was voted as the most popular of the Starter Pokémon from Pokémon Black and White. As such, it has been nicknamed "Smugleaf" by fans and has quickly become an internet meme. GamesRadar`s Gudmundson called it "arguably the coolest-looking starter of the three." Gudmundson later noted its quality as a grass Pokémon due to a healthy movepool of grass-type moves. IGN`s Audrey Drake and Rich George chose Snivy as their starting Pokémon; Drake chose it "because he`s a little badass" and due to it being the most challenging, while George described him as "mischievous". Drake found its final form`s lack of arms to be weird, while George called it an "awesome demon snake." Fellow IGN editor Sam Claiborn described Snivy as an "abomination."</description>

<description>Cilan is a gym leader of Sanyo City Gym where he shares the responsibility with Chili and Cress. He is also a Pokémon Sommelier who, with his abundance of knowledge and experience, determines the compatibility of Trainers and Pokémon and gives them advice on how to befriend each other. Cilan specializes in Grass type Pokémon and his main Pokémon and partner is Yanappu. Cilan revealed during BW19 that he had passed the required exams of the Pokémon Sommelier association to become a certified A-class Sommelier who is able to make compatibility diagnoses.
Cilan has many female fans who flock to his presence though he puts off their advances almost immediately. Brock has been quoted saying that, "Cilan is gay." and Shigeru`s fanclub has extended an invitation to all female Cilan fans to join the Gary Oak`s fanclub instead! The Polish drug scene has seen an increase in the usage of the ACE inhibitor Cilan (Cilazapril) as a result of Cilan flamboyant escapades at night. In the English closed captions for BW12, the transcribers listed Cilan as `Cilas`. A quick google search for `Cilas` and the first result is Cialis, an erectile dysfunction disorder drug.
It`s Dent Time! - Dent`s Catch Phrases
Dent in the Japanese original has various phrases that are based off his original "It`s Tasting Time!" catch phrase. It`s generally modified in the episode to match what`s going on in that particular instance. Below is a list of these catch phrases.
It`s Cilan Time! - Cilan`s Catch Phrases
Cilan in the English Dub has various phrases that are based off Dent`s original "It`s Tasting Time!" catch phrase. Some of them are exclusive to the English dub.
Rival Cabernet
Burgundy is Pokémon Sommelière and a Pokémon Trainer who upon passing the C-class Sommelier test, decided to challenge Cilan at the Sanyo Gym for the Tri Badge. Cilan defeated her but when Burgundy returned to challenge Cilan at the gym, Chili and Cress had to explain that Cilan was on a journey and was no longer at the gym. Angry that Cilan was not the gym leader when she visited, she battled at the gym anyhow and won the Tri Badge.
Cilan encountered her at a Friendly Shop while on his way to Hiun City and she was now out for revenge. Burgundy challenged Cilan to a revenge battle where she ended up losing to him yet again. More angry than ever, she vowed to defeat Cilan the next time they met while working to become an S-class Sommelière and she took off.
Fishing Sommelier
In BW26, Cilan stated that he was a Fishing Sommelier. He was able to help Bianca learn how to fish better by showing her how to select a good fishing rod and then the two basic forms of casting techniques: the overhead cast and the side hand cast. Cilan also showed her the proper lure techniques by spinning the reel slowly and not rushing to attempt to catch the Water Pokémon. He has his own fishing rod that is collapsible and easy to carry. Cilan proved his Fishing Sommelier were quite good by catching a large Bassrao at the Fishing Tournament.Cilan`s Stunfisk was also captured by using his fishing skills.
Science Sommelier
In BW33, Cilan explained that he is not only a Pokémon Sommelier but also a Science Sommelier. A Science Sommelier is someone who tries to solve any kind of supernatural phenomenon by finding out the cause scientifically by collecting evidence and proving their theory. Cilan has always tried to solve mysterious problems scientifically like the poltergeist that he and his friends encountered at the Shippo Museum in BW14 which turned out to be a Deathmas.
Movie Sommelier
In BW40, Cilan announced that he as a Movie Sommelier, someone that is able to review, critique and analyze the different elements of a movie and its characters. Cilan specifically showed his knowledge as a Movie Sommelier when he was helping out with Luke`s movie "Legend of the Pokémon Knight" by making suggestions and improvising on the go. He also helped out Ash who was a bit nervous being in front of the camera and he talked about the famous movie, "The Mask of Deathmas", where the heroine is portrayed as putting her life on the line for the sake of acting. He told Ash that in order to move the viewers with his performance, he`d need to become the role he was assigned.
Metro Sommelier
While heading down to the underground railway in Raimon City, Cilan professed that he was also a Metro Sommelier. Metro Sommeliers are divided into a "car group", which is particular about the cars or into a "line group", which is particular about the lines. Cilan said he belonged to the car group. being a metro sommelier is basically joining a fan club for people that metro transit. Cilan met Subway Boss Ingo and Subway Boss Emmet at the previous years subway convention. Cilan`s knowledge came in quite handy when he had to drive the rail carriage to catch up to Team Rocket.
In BW53, Cilan used his skills as a Metro Sommelier to help him complete the subway station stamp rally so he could battle against Subway Boss Ingo and Subway Boss Emmet. Cilan had been dreaming of doing the rally for many years so he could battle them as its considered a great honor for Metro Sommelier`s. Cilan was also able to use his knowledge and skills as a Metro Sommelier to reunite Erina with her Kibago.
Trial Sommelier
While in Astilbe Town, Ash`s Tepig original owner Shamus was put on trial by Cilan after he revealed that he was a Trial Sommelier. He presented himself as an impartial courtroom judge in the Karakusa Town Pokabu Abandonment case where Prosecutor Ash told about the cruel abandonment of Ash`s Tepig where it had a rope tied up around its mouth. The defendant Shamus told a different story though as he said that forcing a talentless Pokémon into futile battles is crueler. Unable to make a decision in the case, Don George suggested that the verdict be decided with a battle and Cilan agreed. After Ash`s Pignite defeated Shamus, Cilan said the battle had a superb taste and that there`s no need to hand down a verdict as it`s obvious that Ash and Ash`s Tepig were right.
Gym Battle against Skyla
After watching Skyla perform `air battles` which were her determining how a battle would go against her gym challengers by simulating the battle in her head, Cilan got very upset that she was not actually doing the battles and he challenged her to a battle. Cilan agreed to do an `air battle` with her and she determined that he would loose the battle against her with the Pokémon he had chosen to battle her with. Cilan though wanted to have a real battle with her a he explained to her that with Pokémon battle, like any meal, must be tasted first before people can be certain to know anything. Skyla agreed and Cilan thought that he would be able to show her up by defeating her in a real battle and showing how her `air battles` are flawed. Unfortunately Cilan ended up loosing to Skyla but Ash challenged her to a battle right after.
Fukiyose Tower Bell of Wishes Festival
Stephan met up with Cilan and his friends and informed them of the Fukiyose Tower Bell of Wishes Festival that he was going to participate in. After hearing from him that it was an awesome event held once a year at the Fukiyose Tower, Cilan and his friends decided to enter the tournament with Stephan.
During the quiz, Cilan didn`t know how they`d be able to answer the question about who Miles liked better as it was a very subjectional question. Miles was going to pick Nurse Joy (Isshu) as the girl he preferred the most but Cilan seemed to notice Ricky`s Elgyem use its abilities to affect Miles but didn`t say anything as they were able to successfully get the question right and move on to the next round.
In the scavenger hunt, Cilan successfully managed to find a Miracle Shooter while he lent his fishing rod to Iris. In the tub race, Cilan`s Pansage on instruction from Cilan, paddled in the water the same way it used Dig to advance them to the next round. During the imitation competition, Cilan was forced to dress as Elesa and Cilan`s Pansage was forced to dress-up as Elesa`s Emolga. Everyone thought Cilan did an amazing job but Miles informed Cilan that he was a very big Elesa fan and he had to be very strict with imitations of her. Cilan was then eliminated from the tournament.
Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup
Cilan participated in the Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup at the Kagome Town stadium. In the first round he was in the third match and faced off against Shepherd. The match was quickly showcased and Cilan won the battle and advanced to the second round while Shepherd was eliminated from the tournament.</description>

<description>Tepig is a Fire Pig Pokémon that resembles a pig and is one of the starter Pokémon for Pokémon Black and White versions. When hungry, it uses its flame to cook for its food. It blows fire from its nostrils, but this is replaced with smoke when it catches a cold. In an interview with Ken Sugimori, he stated that Tepig`s evolution would be Chinese style of design. Tepig`s original Japanese name is a portmanteau of "Pokapoka", a Japanese word that refers to the warm feeling that circulates repeatedly throughout a body, and "Buu", which refers to a pig`s sound.Tepig was the third Pokémon that Ash Ketchum caught in the Unova region. In the english version, he was voiced by Marc Thompson.
In the anime, Tepig was first seen in In the Shadow of Zekrom!, under the ownership of Professor Juniper, as one of the starter Pokémon to be chosen by Trip. One later appears as an unfortunate Pokémon that was left behind by its trainer in Battle Club, after being defeated in a challenge. Ash Ketchum befriended the Pokémon and captured it afterward. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Tepig, along with Oshawott and Snivy appear when Black accidentally drops his box containing the Pokémon. The Tepig eventually joins his team and is named "Poka", which is short for Tepig`s Japanese name, Pokabu. Tepig is Cheren`s starter Pokémon in the Pokémon Master Black &amp; White manga series.
The Escapist criticized Tepig`s evolution line for being another Fire/Fighting type starter. Game Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava criticized its name for possibly being a pun of "tepid", which means lukewarm. GamesRadar`s Carolyn Gudmundson criticized its evolutionary line; while she enjoyed the first form`s design, she felt that the final form was a disappointment, as well as the use of a combination of fire and fighting as its type, a type combination used for the last three fire starters. IGN`s Sam Claiborn chose Tepig as his starting Pokémon due to its final form which he described as a "bipedal pig demon".</description>

<description>Oshawott, known as the Sea Otter Pokémon, has a shell on its belly made of the same components as fingernails. It can detach the shell from its body and use it as a blade. Oshawott appears in Pokémon Black and White, where it is first available as a Starter Pokémon for players to choose from alongside Snivy and Tepig. After gaining enough experience in battle, Oshawott evolves into Dewott, and then into Samurott.</description>

<description>Pansage is known as the Grass Monkey Pokémon. It is part of a trio that seems to be inspired by the three wise monkeys motif; with its mouth open, Pansage represents "speak no evil". Pansage lives in thick forests, and shares the leaves on its head with exhausted Pokémon. They have the effect of relieving from fatigue.
In the anime, Cilan owns a Pansage that first appeared along with Pansear and Panpour owned by Chili and Cress respectively. In the Pocket Monsters BW manga, Cilan uses a Pansage against Isamu Akai`s Clefairy in issue 3 when he tries to instigate a fight between Cilan, Chili, and Cress. In the Pokémon Master Black &amp; White manga, Cheren uses a Pansage against Monta in a triple battle.
Game Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava stated that its ability, Gluttony, "almost makes up for the broccoli growing out of its head". GamesRadar`s Carolyn Gudmundson commented that it was the most appealing of the three monkeys, design-wise. She also compared it to Eevee and its evolutions, due to each one being of a different type: grass, fire, and water.</description>

<description>Professor Juniper has a lab in Kanako Town of the Isshu region and is an acquaintance of Professor Samual Oak. Ash met Professor Juniper during his first day in the Isshu region and with her help, Pikachu was able to recover from Zekrom attack.
Professor Juniper introduced Ash to Trip. She also gives out Tsutarja, Pokabu and Mijumaru to starting Pokémon Trainers.
Pokémon Restoration Device
In BW39, Fennel and Professor Juniper finished creating the Pokémon Restoration Device which is used to revive ancient Pokémon from fossils. Fennel`s Musharna was hooked up to the device so its dream energy could be used in the Pokémon restoration process. After receiving a Feather Fossil from Lenora, the device was able to analyze the genetic information from the fossil to revive the ancient bird Pokémon Archeos. The Pokémon Restoration Device was later destroyed by Archeos`s tree which resonated along with Archen`s cry.
Team Rocket though was able to hack into Fennel`s computer network and copy the design data of the Pokémon Restoration Device and sent the information to Doctor Zager.
Link Trade Machine and Tag Battle Against Ash and Cilan
Professor Juniper brought her link trade device to investigate the influence the Electric Stones have on evolutions. She setup the device at her base camp outside the caves. She agreed to trade her Karrablast for Bianca`s Shelmet using the machine after they figured out what was causing the electric abnormality that was affecting the machine.
After Bianca`s Shelmet and Professor Juniper`s Karrablast evolved via link trade, Professor Juniper suggested to Bianca that they team up and have a tag battle against Ash and Cilan. Ash`s Boldore and Cilan`s Crustle had recently evolved so they decided to use them against Bianca`s Escavalier and Professor Juniper`s Accelgor. After Professor Juniper`s Accelgor did a quick Recover, Professor Juniper`s Accelgor and Bianca`s Escavalier started working together and they combined their Hyper Beam attacks which knocked out Ash`s Boldore. Cilan`s Crustle fought back with its powerful Rock Wrecker to knock out both Bianca`s Escavalier and Professor Juniper`s Accelgor and give Ash and Cilan the tag battle win.
After the battle, Professor Juniper checked both Bianca`s Escavalier and her Accelgor`s data to notice that their power has increased by a whole lot. She also noted that they fought really well even though their opponent Cilan was Gym Leader.</description>

<description>Trip is a Pokémon photographer and a beginning Pokémon Trainer. His Japanese name is likely derived from "shooting pictures". He started off his journey at Professor Juniper lab and selected Tsutarja as his starter Pokémon. He was introduced to Ash while he was there.
The two of them decided to have a battle but Ash and Pikachu lost to Trip and Tsutarja and so the rivalry began.
-Battle with Chili-
Cilan explained to Ash and Iris that Trip`s Servine battled Chili won against Chili`s Pansear to get the Tri Badge. Trip`s Servine had a type disadvantage in that battle, so the fact it was able to overcome that to win, proved to Cilan that Trip was a strong trainer.</description>

<description>Officer Jenny is the local law enforcement leader in the Isshu region. Each city and area has a Jenny who looks exactly the same as she does elsewhere in the Isshu region though they do look different compared to their Jenny counterparts elsewhere in the Pokémon World.
The most noticeable different between Isshu region Jenny and those from elsewhere in the Pokémon World is their haircut.
Psychic type Investigator
While Ash and his friends were sleeping in a dream world hotel, Officer Jenny came in through their window to investigate. She explained to them that she was a Psychic type Investigator and was not there to arrest them. Officer Jenny`s Duosion is Psychic type Investigator Jenny`s main Pokémon that she uses it to help her investigate instances and crimes when Psychic Pokémon are involved. Officer Jenny and her Officer Jenny`s Duosion helped rescue Pikachu, Meowth and Iris`s Axew from Leon and arrested him.
Gigaiath and Champion Master Adeku
In BW54, Alder was seen sitting in the sidecar with Officer Jenny`s Herdier. The two seemed to get along quite well despite Officer Jenny instance that Alder carry on with his business. Alder noted to Officer Jenny (Isshu) that her Herdier looked happy to get his attention. Officer Jenny was not impressed with his attempts to go on a date with her and she threatened to arrest him if he didn`t leave her alone. She couldn`t believe that he was actually the Unova region Elite Four Champion.
Later on in the day, the two met up again as a raging Gigaiath threatened Raimon City. Alder came to the rescue and taught Officer Jenny a lesson in humility and observation as he was able to stop the raging Gigaiath despite her attempt to intervene and stop it herself by force. Officer Jenny wanted to guard and supervise the Gigaiath but after it saved her from being crushed by a falling pillar, she realized that the nail that was removed from its foot was the true reason that the Gigaiath was raging and Alder had recognized that. Her opinion of Gigaiath and Alder seemed to change after those events.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Joy is the name for every member of an identical family of Pokémon nurses. They mainly work in Pokémon Centers, but they also work in other locations. They are also often accompanied by a Chansey or Blissey. Like Chansey and Blissey, all Nurse Joys are mostly hospitable, especially towards Pokémon. Brock, who claims to be able to tell the Joys just by minor appearance details (different-colored crosses on their hats; hair is slightly shorter; smile is wider; etc.), is infatuated with every Nurse Joy he meets, and often has to be restrained by a traveling companion. Although all of them look completely identical to each other, some do have different personalities, and a few even other occupations besides nursing. There is a Nurse Joy who is a body builder, a contest judge and even one who is scared of water Pokémon. In the Pokémon Diamond and Pearl series, there was also a Nurse Joy who is married and has two daughters who both have the name "Joy" at the end of their names and looks exactly like their mother rather than their father. Pokémon: The Electric Tale of Pikachu manga author Toshihiro Ono cited her as one of his favorite characters to draw for the series, stating the reason as "because she`s a girl".</description>

<description>Servine, a Grass Snake Pokémon, is the evolution of Snivy. Servine resembles a grass snake, and its appearance is very similar to Snivy except its back is grown by three palmate leaves with three prongs each. During a battle, it can run as if gliding from the ground that may bewilder its enemies. It evades attack by passing overgrown plants and then whipping the foe quickly.
In the anime, a Servine is first seen battling against a Dewott in one of the Battle Clubs in the Unova region. Trip`s Snivy was revealed to have evolved into a Servine some time before Trip`s second battle against Ash Ketchum.</description>

<description>Patrat, known as the Lookout Pokémon, is a rodent-like Pokémon that resembles a chipmunk. It continues keeping watch for several days, saving up food in its cheek pouches. It signals to its companions with its tail. They are extremely wary and keep watch outside their burrows in turns. They become anxious if no one keeps watch.
Patrat first appeared in the first few episodes of the Pokémon: Black and White anime. Multiple Patrat made a brief cameo in Black and White episode 3 with multiple Pidove and Deerling where they needed help from Ash and his friends. In the Pokémon Master Black &amp; White manga, Monta captures a Patrat in the first chapter.
Patrat and its evolution Watchog were called "fairly unremarkable aside from their intense facial expressions" by GamesRadar`s Carolyn Gudmundson. Gudmundson later noted it as a "Bidoof analog", in spite of the fact that it can only learn one Hidden Machine, whereas Bidoof can learn many. She adds that it is very easy to become bored of it. Official Nintendo Magazine`s Chris Schilling commented that Patrat was the "new Bidoof".</description>

<description>Woobat, known as the Bat Pokémon, is a white, shaggy creature based upon the Honduran white bat. It has a piggish, large nose with a nostril in the shape of a heart. Its eyes are hidden behind two shaggy tufts of fur. It has a large mouth with a single fang, and two relatively small wings on either side of it. It lives in dark forests and caves. It explores its surroundings by releasing ultrasonic waves from its nostrils. It sleeps stuck on the walls of caves by its nostrils. It leaves heart marks on the places where it was stuck.
Woobat`s first appearance in the video games is in the two games Pokémon Black and White as a common Pokémon found in the wild. It eventually evolves into the Pokémon Swoobat by leveling up when its happiness is high. Happiness can be raised by fighting through many Pokémon battles. In the games, it was described as Black and White`s version of the Pokémon Zubat due to being of a similar species Woobat also appears in the Pokémon spin-off game Battle &amp; Get! Pokémon Typing DS where players type in the names of Pokémon that they see. In the anime, Jessie catches a Woobat while in a cave with James and Meowth. She uses it to battle against Ash and Iris. It manages to defeat Ash`s newly captured Pidove but is defeated by Oshawott`s Water Gun. Woobat has made other minor appearances in the anime. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, a Woobat is in the possession of the character White.
IGN described it as the baby of "a Tribble, a bat, and a pig". Game Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava stated "I kind of like the idea of having a romantic bat as a Pokémon... However, I`m not sold on its abilities". Jeremy Parish of Retronauts criticized the series` use of redundant new Pokémon, commenting that Woobat was the same as Zubat, referencing the uncanny similarities in name. IGN`s Jack DeVries questioned whether Woobat would act as a Zubat replacement. He later expressed that despite being unsure of Woobat`s quality, he wrote that "at least he`s not a Zubat". 1UP.com`s Kat Bailey wrote that Woobat was basically a Zubat with a pig`s snout. 1UP.com`s Michael Vreeland wrote that Woobat was "a lot more interesting" than Zubat. G4TV`s Nikole Zivalich, however wrote that Woobat was derivative and inferior to Zubat and that while fans will appreciate not having to run into so many Zubats, the "alternative isn`t much better". Carolyn Gudmundson of GamesRadar similarly described Woobat as the "new Zubat", noting that based on their looks, it and its evolution are two of their favourite Pokémon; however, they do note that they have some faults gameplay-wise.</description>

<description>Darumaka is a Fire-type Pokémon introduced in Generation V.
It evolves into Darmanitan starting at level 35.
In Galar, Darumaka has an Ice-type regional form. It evolves into Galarian Darmanitan when exposed to an Ice Stone.
Darumaka is a round, red Pokémon with an orange face and yellow curly eyebrows. It has three yellow ovals on its abdomen and a curvy yellow line on its back. Its paws are orange and have three digits each. It has very warm droppings, which ancient people put in their clothes to keep themselves warm.
When the flame inside its body burns, Darumaka is very active. It cannot calm down in this state, and thus becomes uncontrollable. As the flame shrinks, it falls asleep. It can tuck in its arms and legs when it rests; during that time, it slightly sways. While it is sleeping, it cannot be tipped over no matter how much it is pushed or pulled, like a tumbler doll, which it resembles in this state. It prefers to live in a desert environment.
Galarian Darumaka has a thicker coat than normal Darumaka, several turquoise ice crystals as its eyebrows and on its chest, and has blue hands and face with white snowy fur. Unlike its normal form, Galarian Darumaka has a timid frown instead of a mischievous smile.
Seismic shift in the Galar region long ago caused the warm climate to cool, and Darumaka in this region have adapted to this cooling. The fire that burned within their bodies went out, leaving an organ that produces cold air instead. The colder Darumaka gets, the more energetic it becomes. They can focus their internal energy to breathe out cold air in the form of snow, which they use to make snowballs for ammo in playful snowball fights with each other. Galarian Darumaka enjoys eating Berries produced by Snover. This leads it to prey on Snover often being driven off by Abomasnow.</description>

<description>Iris`s Axew was first seen appearing out of Iris`s large hairdo, much to the surprise of Ash and Pikachu. Ash helped rescue Axew from Team Rocket when they captured it just after Iris met Ash.
Axew is Iris`s main Pokémon and it doesn`t seem to like to travel in its monster ball. It seems to prefer traveling on Iris`s shoulders and in her hair.
Mastering Dragon Rage
Iris had been practicing Dragon Rage with her Kibago for quite a while and every time the attack was used it was unsuccessful and created a crater in the ground where the attack was used and injured everyone in the area. After being captured by Team Rocket along with Crimgan, Iris`s Axew managed to master Dragon Rage which was powerful enough to crash their flying transport mecha. In the battle encounter with Team Rocket that occurred after the crash, Iris`s Axew showed everyone that it had finally mastered the move by launching a successful attack at Team Rocket but they managed to escape before it hit them.
Don Battles Against Luke`s Golett
Iris`s Axew and Luke`s Golett were matched up in the semi-final round of the Don Battles in Raimon Town. Luke`s Golett dominated most of the battle and just as Iris`s Axew was about to be defeated, it learned the move Outrage. Outrage was able to do significant damage to Luke`s Golett and it knocked it out which eliminated Luke from the tournament.
Battle against Cynthia`s Garchomp / Learning Giga Impact
Iris asked to battle Cynthia`s Garchomp with her Kibago as she was working on becoming a Dragon Master. Even before it the started, the battled seemed like Cynthia`s Garchomp would win. Iris`s Axew could not do any damage to Cynthia`s Garchomp until it finally concentrated for a few moments and learned Giga Impact. While Giga Impact was able to do some damage to Cynthia`s Garchomp, it quickly overpowered Iris`s Axew until Cynthia decided to end the match before a finishing blow.</description>

Ash called it cute when he first saw it which caused Mijumaru to blush a bit. After being shocked that it wasn`t chosen by Trip, it followed Ash and Pikachu as they started their journey in the Isshu region.
It rescued Pikachu and Iris`s Axew from Rocket Gang. Ash thanked it but quickly left it behind in the forest so that he could treat Pikachu. It continued following Ash until one day it met up again and tried to explain that it wanted to join Ash on his journey. Ash tried to capture it with one of his Poké balls but then realized it already had a Poké ball and that this Mijumaru must have been the same one that he met at Professor Juniper lab. He contacted Professor Juniper and she agreed to let him have the Mijumaru and transferred its Poké ball to him. By the time it had been transferred over, it had disappeared again.
Ash met up with Mijumaru once again when they were resting in the sands at Dan`s hotel. After protecting Ash from being scalded from a hot water geyser, Ash quickly recalled it into the Poké ball before it got scalded itself. Since then Ash`s Oshawott has had the tendency to come out of its Poké ball whenever it feels like despite what the current situation is.
Gym Battles against Lenora`s Watchog
During the first gym battle against Ash`s Oshawott, Lenora`s Watchog used Mean Look so Ash`s Oshawott couldn`t be switched out. Since Ash`s Oshawott wasn`t expecting to battle Lenora`s Watchog at that time, it was at a disadvantage and it was in a bad mood. After Ash`s Oshawott lost its shell during the battle, Lenora`s Watchog was able to use its Thunderbolt effectively to knock Ash`s Oshawott out of the match.
During the rematch battle against Lenora`s Watchog, Ash`s Oshawott had learned Aqua Jet during the time between the two battle and but its accuracy make it easy for Lenora`s Watchog to avoid it. Though through sheer luck, Ash`s Oshawott Aqua Jet managed to hit Lenora`s Watchog and both ended up getting knocked out at the same time as Lenora`s Watchog used Thunderbolt just before it got hit.
Three-on-Three Battle Against Trip`s Timburr
Ash`s Oshawott was paired up against Trip`s Timburr but the beginning of the battle didn`t go to well for Ash as Ash`s Oshawott had its eyes closed during Aqua Jet and completely missed hitting Trip`s Timburr. After a short break in the battle, the two finished up with their final attacks. Ash`s Oshawott`s Razor Shell proved to be stronger than Trip`s Timburr`s DynamicPunch and Ash`s Oshawott defeated Trip`s Timburr despite its initial problems with Aqua Jet`s accuracy.
Mastering Aqua Jet
While training in Don George`s pool for the battle against Lenora, Ash`s Oshawott learned Aqua Jet. It`s aim proved to be quite off but through sheer luck it was able to use Aqua Jet to knock out both Lenora`s Watchog and Stephan`s Blitzle. It wasn`t until Trip noticed by taking some pictures during his three-on-three battle with Ash that Ash`s Oshawott had its eyes closed during Aqua Jet. Ash vowed to help his Oshawott practice to keep its eyes open underwater so that its Aqua Jet`s targeting would be accurate.
While enroute to Raimon City, Ash, Iris and Cilan`s Pokémon all got poisoned and the only thing that could cure them was a waterweed plant found in a nearby lake. Ash`s Oshawott was training with Ash at the time and didn`t get poisoned and since it was a Water Pokémon, it was best suited for the job. Unfortunately Ash`s Oshawott still didn`t like to open its eyes underwater until it was forced to defend itself against a school of Tympole who were protecting their lake from trespassers. Ash`s Oshawott opened its eyes underwater to defend itself and it started to get comfortable doing so. Ash`s Oshawott was later forced to battle Palpitoad because it came out of the water to protect its lake. During the battle, Ash`s Oshawott managed to master its Aqua Jet as it was able to remember the battle against the Tympole school and how having its eyes opened underwater was quite effective and that proved to be the decisive factor in the battle as Palpitoad was knocked out and Ash caught it.
Battle against Bel`s Father`s Hihidaruma
Ash challenged Bianca`s Father to a Pokémon battle to allow Bianca to continue to travel. He agreed but changed the challenge to force Ash to return home to Pallet Town if he lost the battle. Ash`s Oshawott came out of its ball as it wanted to battle against Bianca`s Father`s Darmanitan and Ash thought that it would be okay because it had a type advantage being a water Pokémon. Even though Bianca`s Father`s Darmanitan only used Fire type moves throughout the battle, it proved to be too strong for Ash`s Oshawott. Ash`s Oshawott did manage to land an Aqua Jet. Bianca`s Father commented though that his Red Flash Hihidaruma gets more fired up the more resistance it faces and shortly after it knocked Ash`s Oshawott out. Despite loosing the battle, Bianca`s Father changed his mind because the battle with Ash and his Mijumaru made him remember the joy of traveling.
Battle Against Pod`s Baoppu
Initially, Ash was going to battle Chili`s Pansear with his Pikachu, but Ash`s Oshawott popped out and wanted to battle it instead. Ash agreed and despite the type disadvantage in this battle, Chili just got more fired up. Chili`s Pansear managed to cover its weakness with power and momentum and taking Cilan`s advice into account, it used Flame Charge to increase its speed to become useful when dodging Ash`s Oshawott moves. Chili`s Pansear managed to endure Ash`s Oshawott super effective moves just long enough for it to use its newly learned SolarBeam attack which Ash`s Oshawott was unable to dodge and it was knocked out. Chili`s Pansear won the battle despite the type disadvantage.
Battle Against Clay`s Krokorok
Clay`s Krokorok was the first Pokémon Clay used to battle against Ash during his gym battle. Clay`s Krokorok was paired up against Ash`s Oshawott as Pikachu initially wanted to battle it but Ash realized that an Electric type against a Ground type would be a bad idea.
At the beginning of the battle, Clay`s Krokorok had the upper hand as its Sandstorm managed to get sand in Ash`s Oshawott`s eyes and it also made it harder for Ash`s Oshawott to accurately attack. Clay`s Krokorok managed to hit Ash`s Oshawott with a Bite and a Stone Edge attack but it wasn`t enough to knock it out. Ash`s Oshawott used Water Gun to clear up the Sandstorm and then it began its counterattack. Clay`s Krokorok was repetitively hit with multiple attacks from Ash`s Oshawott including a super effective Aqua Jet and Razor Shell combo that ended up being too much for it and it was knocked out.
Battle Against Clay`s Palpitoad
Ash decided to keep his Oshawott out to battle against Clay`s Palpitoad and right away it became evident that Clay`s Palpitoad was the stronger Pokémon as its Hydro Pump ended up being more powerful than Ash`s Oshawott Water Gun. Clay`s Palpitoad followed up with a Sludge Bomb that knocked Ash`s Oshawott`s scallsword out of its hand and just as it was retrieving it, it got hit by Clay`s Palpitoad Rock Smash`s and was knocked out.
Ash`s Oshawott and Dawn`s Piplup Rivalry
Ash`s Oshawott and Dawn`s Piplup both fell in love with Meloetta and the two of them began a rivalry to win the affection of Meloetta. Ash`s Oshawott would often come out of its PokéBall when it could tell that Dawn`s Piplup was trying to take advantage of a situation. Even though the two of them often argued, they found a common ground and became friends after Meloetta left.</description>

Ash saw Pokabu on the security camera video and thought it was an Umbreon because it was all dirty. When Ash finally spotted Pokabu, he cornered it in an alley and tried to be friendly with it. Ash noticed the rope tied around its snout and loosened it. Pokabu then helped rescue Pikachu from Team Rocket.
Iris wanted to get Pokabu but it wanted to be caught by Ash instead. Realizing that Pokabu wanted to travel with him, Ash captured Pokabu just outside the Battle Club in Karakusa Town.</description>

Battle Against Pod`s Baoppu
Chili wanted to see the results of Cilan`s studying and he challenged him to a battle. Chili thought that it would be an easy battle as they had the super effective type advantage but as the battle progressed Chili didn`t like the fact that Cilan`s Pansage kept avoiding all of Chili`s Pansear fire attacks and Chili told Cilan that running away all the time doesn`t make a battle. Cilan though told him that running away is a perfectly fine way to battle. Chili got more angry during the battle and after loosing he blamed his Baoppu for the loss as it missed its Fire Blast at the most crucial moment. Chili`s Pansear ran away in anger as it was mad it was getting blamed for the loss and Cilan then blamed Chili for the loss in the battle which only fueled Chili`s anger and he ran off as well.
Battle against Skyla
Skyla`s Unfezant was matched up against Cilan`s Pansage in Skyla`s air battle and she believed that her Unfezant would be victorious. In the actual gym battle, Skyla`s Swoobat was matched up against Cilan`s Pansage. It proved to be very fast in the air and easily dodged all of Cilan`s Pansage`s attacks. It only used two attacks against Cilan`s Pansage: a Air Cutter and a Gust attack before it knocked it out and gave Skyla the victory in the first round.

Realizing that it was a strong and powerful Pokémon, he decided to try to capture it right away but it didn`t get captured in the monster ball. Ash then instructed Pikachu to attack Tsutarja but Ash ended up having to protect Pikachu from Tsutarja`s powerful vine whips as it was exposed to Attract which made it dizzy.
Ash`s Oshawott and Ash`s Tepig were both sent out to battle Tsutarja as well but it used Attract against them which proved quite effective due to the gender differences. Ash finally instructed his Mamepato to battle as it wasn`t affected by Attract. After a fierce battle between Tsutarja and Mamepato, Tsutarja was weakened enough and Ash captured it successfully.
Don George Tournament
Georgia faced Ash in the second round of the Don George tournament in Raimon Town. Georgia`s Pawniard faced Ash`s Snivy and at the beginning of the battle it looked like it was going to easily win but Ash`s Snivy was able to avoid getting hit by Guillotine. From that point on, Ash`s Snivy took control of the match and was able to defeat Georgia`s Pawniard which advanced Ash on to the next round in the tournament.
Gym Battle Against Elesa`s Emolga
After Elesa`s Emolga defeated Ash`s Palpitoad, Ash`s Snivy was sent out to battle against Elesa`s Emolga but Ash didn`t really have a battle strategy anymore since his Palpitoad had been defeated and he forgot that Emolga was also a Flying type. Elesa`s Emolga combination of Acrobatics and Aerial Ace was just too hard for Ash`s Snivy to defend against as the type advantage hampered it. Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy fairly easily.
Battle against Katharine`s Gothita
Katharine`s Gothita convinced Ash`s Scraggy to come with it outside to get something to eat. They ended up getting in trouble with a Garbodor and Katharine`s Deerling to use its Aromatherapy to calm down the raging Garbodor after Ash`s Snivy had followed them to see what they were up to. Katharine`s Gothita did not like the fact that Ash`s Snivy had been looking up on them and it decided it wanted to battle it.
Katharine`s Gothita was quite mad at Ash`s Snivy but it didn`t stand a chance against it in battle. Ash`s Snivy barely broke a sweat as it was able to counter and avoid all of Katharine`s Gothita`s attacks before it knocked it out with its Leaf Storm. Still upset, Katharine`s Gothita ran off into the distance.
Battle against Clay`s Palpitoad
After knocking out Ash`s Oshawott, Ash`s Snivy was sent out to replace it as Ash picked it because it was strong against both Ground and Water. Ash`s Snivy used Attract right at the beginning of their battle which prove to be an unexpected yet effective technique as Clay`s Palpitoad was unable to attack after the effects of Attract took hold of it. Ash`s Snivy pummeled Clay`s Palpitoad with effective Grass type attacks until it was knocked out.
Battle against Clay`s Excadrill
Ash kept his Snivy out to battle against Clay`s Excadrill but that matchup didn`t last long as Clay`s Excadrill was able to defend against all of Ash`s Snivy`s attacks. Ash`s Snivy was quickly knocked out with a strong Horn Drill.</description>

She called out Excadrill to help rescue Axew from between Pendra`s horns but it stayed in its curled up drill state until after Axew was rescued. Pendra though was still raging and it kicked Excadrill and got it angry. It then drilled underneath Pendra and then set it flying.
Excadrill didn`t always want to obey Iris when its asked to do something. For awhile, it was stubborn but Iris`s Excadrill was able to overcome the feelings of resentment and lost of trust it felt from the battle against Drayden`s Haxorus. After relating her experience to Ash and Cilan, it became more clear to Iris that she was not fully understanding her Excadrill`s feelings. Iris apologized to her Excadrill as she finally realized that her Excadrill knew after the first hit during the battle against Drayden`s Haxorus that they couldn`t win against it.
Battle against Drayden`s Haxorus at Dragon Village Battle Tournament
Having watched Iris`s Excadrill battle and defeat the Trainer`s Crimgan at the battle tournament in the Dragon Village, Drayden came out of the tent to meet Iris and her Excadrill. Iris challenged Drayden to a battle and if they won the battle, it would be their 100th victory together. Drayden accepted and sent out his Haxorus. Iris`s Excadrill was no match for Drayden`s Haxorus and it was defeated with a powerful Rock Smash attack. After the battle it began to distrust Iris and hid itself in its drilling position.
Mastering Focus Blast
Iris eventually realized that her Excadrill didn`t know any moves that it could use to fight with from a distance. She also realized that if it had known one at an earlier time, they would`ve had more options on how to construct our battles and would have been better prepared against Drayden`s Haxorus which had strong counter defenses against close range attacks. The night Iris apologized to her Excadrill, it decided to go out into the forest to practice working on Focus Blast. Iris showed up and the two of them practiced all through the night until it was finally able to successfully launch the attack.
Battles against Langley`s Beartic
After Iris`s Axew was defeated by Georgia`s Beartic, Iris was confident that her Excadrill was easily strong enough to defeat Georgia`s Beartic. She called her Excadrill out to battle but it appeared in its drilling position to which Iris told Georgia that it was in that position because it needed motivation. Georgia`s Beartic quickly attacked it with a Slash attack which was more than enough motivation for it to battle. Unfortunately, it wouldn`t listen to Iris`s commands and it ended up loosing the match when Georgia`s Beartic used Rock Smash, the same move that caused it to loose its first Pokémon battle and began secluding itself.
During the rematch battle, Iris`s Excadrill listened to Iris`s commands and they were able to have a more effective battle. Georgia`s Beartic still proved to be a powerful opponent but this time the battle ended in a draw.
Donamite Tournament
Burgundy`s Dewott entered the Donamite tournament and faced Iris`s Excadrill in the first round. Iris`s Excadrill was able to defend Burgundy`s Dewott new move Ice Beam with its claws but when Iris`s Excadrill dug a hole, Burgundy`s Dewott used Water Pulse in the hole to deal some significant damage and get it back above ground. Iris`s Excadrill fought back with another violent Metal Claw attack which struck its mark and looked like it had defeated Burgundy`s Dewott. Burgundy`s Dewott had another new move up its sleeve and it got up off the ground and used Revenge. Iris`s Excadrill managed to withstand Revenge and counterattack with Dig while Burgundy`s Dewott was still recovering. Iris`s Excadrill won the match and eliminated Burgundy from the tournament.
Rematch Battle against Drayden`s Haxorus at the Soryu Gym
During the battle, Drayden was evaluating how much Iris had grown and he noticed that Iris`s Excadrill power certainly seemed to have improved. The matchup between Iris`s Excadrill and Drayden`s Haxorus ended up in a draw as the two of them knocked each other out.</description>

<description>Bianca only recently started traveling as her father just wouldn`t allow her to start a journey when she wanted to. She is fully motivated for battling and getting gym badges but considers herself quite lazy when it comes to cleaning chores. She is also very eccentric and clumsy. Her purse contains many items that she carries around with her but the inside of it is quite dusty. When she originally met Iris and Dent, she told them she had two badges at that time.
While on route to Shippo City, Ash and friends bumped into Bianca. She had been looking for Ash to deliver a badge case to him from Professor Juniper. Before she could deliver it to him a Chillarmy took the badge case because it was dirty. She instantly fell in love with the Chillarmy and decided she wanted to get it. She attempted to capture it by setting traps but it wasn`t until she took out the monster ball to catch it that Chillarmy noticed was dirty and ended up capturing itself.
Bianca and Ash had battle after they got their Pokémon healed at the Pokémon Center. Pikachu battled Bianca`s Chaoboo but Pikachu proved to be a superior opponent with its Volt Tackle and Bianca was defeated.
Bianca is also a main character in the 5th generation games Black and White. Players encounter and battle her throughout the game.</description>

<description>Kidachi is a curator at the Shippo City Museum where he specializes in Egyptian like artifacts and archeology. His wife is Aloe, the Shippo City Gym Leader and he often calls her `Mama`, similar how parents refer to each other when they have their kids around. He accidentally thought that a Desumasu mask was a replica and was part of the traveling exhibit and he placed it in the display case not knowing that the Desumasu that owned the mask had fallen asleep and it had dropped on the ground. Kidachi closed the Museum while he tried to investigate the reason for a mysterious poltergeist that had begun to scare him in the museum since the exhibit arrived.
With the help of Aloe, Kidachi was able to realize that he had accidentally locked away the mask and it was returned to the Desumasu, allowing the exhibit to be opened to the public.</description>

<description>Aloe is the Gym Leader of Shippo City Gym. Trainers that defeat her are given the Basic Badge. She met Ash and his friends at the Shippo City Museum where she arrived to help figure out the mystery behind the mysterious poltergeist that was scarring Kidachi. She agreed to battle Ash after she solved the mystery of Desumasu`s mask.
The Shippo Gym is located inside the Shippo City museum and Aloe also works as the curator of the museum itself. She runs an archive full of valuable books and research papers that ordinary people are not permitted to view without her permission. Only people who want to use it for examinations, research and Gym match challengers can use the book archive. The library in the museum that Aloe also runs has the most books in the Isshu region.
Aloe tests her challengers as soon as they enter the archive area. She suggests a book to each of them that leads them straight to the underground battlefield but most decide to read up on a subject they are proficient despite the fact that she is actually showing them the shortest route to the Gym. Ash straightforwardness did exactly as Aloe suggested and he picked the book that she suggested, revealing the stairs to the gym right away. Most challengers read too much into her actions and end up taking a detour.
In her first match against Ash she defeated him by studying him and getting to know his tenancies. She revealed her two Pokémon, Aloe`s Yorterry and Aloe`s Miruhog before the match so he could study them as well. In the end, Aloe`s studying of Ash proved to be the turning point in the match and she was able to defeat him. She told Ash to return and battle her again though.</description>

<description>Aloe`s Miruhog was revealed at the Shippo City Museum when it was sent out to battle against the poltergeist. It was able to help get the mask off of Dent and help discover that the poltergeist was a Desumasu that dropped its mask when it was sleeping. Kidachi stated that Miruhog is an amazing Pokémon that is very obedient to Aloe and helps guards the museum.
During the first gym battle against Ash`s Oshawott, it used Mean Look so Ash`s Oshawott couldn`t be switched out. Since Ash`s Oshawott wasn`t expecting to battle Aloe`s Miruhog at that time, it was at a disadvantage and it was in a bad mood. Dent stated during the battle that Aloe`s Miruhog was brilliant at making use of stillness and motion. After Ash`s Oshawott lost its shell during the battle, Aloe`s Miruhog was able to use its Thunderbolt effectively to knock Ash`s Oshawott out of the match.</description>

<description>Aloe`s Yorterry was revealed before her Gym battle with Ash. Iris quickly went up to it as she found it to be a very cute Pokémon. While Yorterry is a lovable Pokémon, it showed in battle that it`s cuteness shouldn`t mistaken or underestimated when it comes to battling. Aloe`s Herderrier is a completely different Pokémon all together from Aloe`s Yorterry and not the evolved form of this Pokémon.
Aloe`s Yorterry`s Roar was very effective in causing Ash`s Tepig to be switched with Ash`s Oshawott in the first gym battle against Aloe. When Ash`s Tepig and Aloe`s Yorterry were matched up at the end of the gym battle, Aloe`s Yorterry Take Down proved to be a very strong move as it knocked out Ash`s Tepig and gave Aloe the match victory.</description>

<description>Aloe`s Herderrier was revealed just before Ash`s rematch with her at the Shippo Gym. Aloe`s Herderrier is a completely different Pokémon all together from Aloe`s Yorterry. During Ash`s rematch battle with Aloe, Aloe`s Herderrier was matched up against Ash`s Tepig. Both Pokémon had become a lot stronger since their previous match-up and it showed during the battle. Roar once again proved to be an effective move causing Ash`s Tepig to be switched with Ash`s Oshawott but Aloe recalled her Harderrier right after the switch.
After the draw battle between Ash`s Oshawott and Aloe`s Miruhog, Aloe`s Herderrier and Ash`s Tepig were matched up again but this time the winner of the battle would win the match. Aloe`s Herderrier used Giga Impact on Ash`s Tepig but it wasn`t enough to knock it out. Ash`s Tepig`s speed had increased because of the training with Don George and it was able to dodge most of Aloe`s Herderrier Shadow Ball`s. The match ended up being decided by a running charge of Aloe`s Herderrier`s Giga Impact against Ash`s Tepig`s Nitro Charge but Aloe`s Herderrier wasn`t able to withstand the attack giving Ash the match victory.</description>

It appears once more in "Rematch at the Nacrene Gym!", where it is defeated by Oshawott`s Aqua Jet.
Game Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava described Watchog as a "pissed-off meerkat", and further calling it a "disgruntled-looking jerk". An editor for GamesRadar included it in a satirical character battle between their "ultimate hated characters".</description>

<description>Garbodor is a Poison-type Pokémon introduced in Generation V.
It evolves from Trubbish starting at level 36. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Garbodor has the appearance of a pile of trash spilling out of a large, torn garbage bag. It has a round, lumpy body that is mostly tan with blue and pink lumps. Its head has the appearance of the tied end of a garbage bag that has been ripped open and trails down like a cape. It has two appendages that look like clumps of garbage coming from its head. Its large, round eyes have small pupils, and when it opens its mouth, its large, triangular teeth can be seen. Garbodor has two long arms made of garbage; one held together with piping, with fingers also made up of piping material, and the other held together with rebar. It has one finger on its left hand and three on the other. It also has flat, dumpy feet.
Garbodor is able to spray poisonous gas and filth from its fingertips, but only from its right hand. If that filth is blocked, its arm can swell up, causing it considerable pain and discomfort. It also finishes off opponents by subduing them with its left arm and spewing an awful-smelling toxic gas from its mouth. Garbodor prefers to live in unsanitary places such as garbage dumps. Garbodor inhales garbage, which then becomes part of its body. The toxic liquid from its right arm is so virulent, it can kill a weakened foe instantly. Alola was once home to many Garbodor, but the population shrank precipitously after Grimer was introduced to its habitat. This is said to have made the remaining Garbodor population stronger than its counterparts from other regions. Alolan Muk preys on Garbodor.
As Gigantamax Garboodor, its size has increased with an altered look. The sclera in its eyes are dark pink. The feet disappear, with the lumpy body expanding. Several discarded toys appear on Garboodor. The toys are as follows: toy car, blocks, toy airplane, toy cruise ship, Substitute doll, Poke Doll, Master Ball, fish skeleton, and toy train. The spikes on its shoulder becomes longer. The right arm becomes bulkier. There is dark blue, pink, and light green spots all across its body. Three red clouds float around the head.
When Gigantamaxing, its toxic gas becomes thicker. This result in the gas taking a solid shape of discarded toys. Gigantamax Garbodor releases the gas through its mouth and fingers. Should the gas engulf someone, the toxin will seep deep in the bones.
Gigantamax Garbodor is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Malodor.</description>

<description>Audino, is known as the Hearing Pokémon. With its big ears, it can access other Pokémon`s emotions and health. It also has the power to understand its surroundings through slight sounds. Audino replaces Chansey and Blissey as the preferred companions of Pokémon Center nurses in the Unova Region, despite its gender ratio being equally balanced.
Players often search incessantly for it, as it gives an enormous amount of Experience Points when defeated, making the training of a Pokémon slightly easy. It also is a Pacifist, based on its healer ability. It can, despite being a pure-normal type, learn nine Psychic-type moves, with two more from breeding.</description>

In a poll by Official Nintendo Magazine, Galvantula was voted as the best Pokémon from Black and White. Editor Thomas East described it as "a great yellow and blue spider capable of capturing its opponents with its electric thread", and stated that it is "Not exactly a Pokemon you`d want to take home to meet the family".</description>

There are 6 purple spots in the fur, and the fur makes the shape of a horn on the top of its head. There is a short tail on its back. It likes to bite at anything that comes close due to the lack of their senses. It also can not aim due to the fur on its head covering its eyes obscuring its vision. Its primary habitat is caves with abundant water sources. Its name comes from dino &amp; ein, which means "one dinosaur".</description>

One can be found sealed off at the end of a deep maze in the Relic Castle after defeating Team Plasma and talking to one of the Seven Sages who was planning to capture it for his lord, Ghetsis. A Volcarona is used by Pokémon League Champion, Alder.

Burgh professed that he was an ingenious artist but he was in the Yaguruma Forest to reinvigorate his creative process. Burgh told Ash and friends that he would guide them out of the Yaguruma Forest but they first had to enjoy life in the forest like he was. They spent the night with Burgh in a large tree before he lead them to the nearest Pokémon Center and told Ash that he would be waiting for his challenge at the gym.

<description>Ash met Kikuyo who runs a Pokémon Day Care near Shippo City where she watches over Pokémon eggs. As thanks for helping out her granddaughter Yuri (Isshu) sort out her kindergarten class, she gave Ash a Pokémon egg. Kikuyo told Ash to raise it well so that it would be a great Pokémon. That Pokémon egg later hatched into Ash`s Zuruggu while Ash was en-route to Castelia City.
While resting, Iris`s Kibago noticed that the egg was beginning to glow but got too excited and caused the egg to fall down the nearby cliff and almost get smashed by a rock. Thankfully, Pikachu`s Quick Attack was fast enough to rescue the egg in time. After hatching, Ash`s Zuruggu`s initial attitude was very overbearing as Pikachu attempted to greet it but it used headbutt on Pikachu. Ash then sent out his other Pokémon but Ash`s Zuruggu ended up fighting them as well. Ash tried to capture it after battling his other Pokémon but it refused to be caught by him at that time.
After its encounter with a group of Dentula, Ash`s other Pokémon came to Ash`s Zuruggu rescue as it was greatly over matched. Ash could tell that it was beginning to trust him. Dent then suggested that Ash`s Zuruggu battle Iris`s Kibago as all the other Pokémon were too strong. Both Pokémon agreed but they ended up knocking each other out at the same time. Ash`s Zuruggu was finally caught after the battle as it had grown to like Ash.</description>

<description>Doctor Zager is a scientist for Team Rocket who was assigned to study and analyze the Meteonite that crashed in the Unova region. As per Pierce`s instructions, Jessie, James and Meowth dropped off the Meteonite fragment they stole from the Shippo Museum when they arrived at MT37 KS816 in Shippo City where Doctor Zager and Pierce were waiting for them. Doctor Zager took the fragment and with the assistance of his equipment, he was able to determine that the fragment was genuine and confirmed it contained materials not normally found on the planet.
Dangoro Cannon
Doctor Zager developed a new weapon endowed with marvelous destructive power for Jessie, James and Meowth which they used in BW37. The mecha had a circular mounted dish with slots for a bunch of Dangoro strapped to it and would extend above the mecha when was going to be fired. Team Rocket explained that there is a high-density energy core inside a Dangoro`s body and with the help of the system that Doctor Zager had developed, it could condense and amplify the energy from their energy core. The weapon would shoot a combined energy beam that was targeted with a scope. The energy amplification would take a few moments to reach its maximum. There was a flaw in the design though as the device couldn`t completely control the Dangoro`s energy cores and that cause the energy to reverse back into the mecha, overloading the system.
Tabunne Sonar Emitting Device
The Tabunne Sonar Emitting Device was used by Team rocket in BW38 so that they could round up enough Tabunne to give to Doctor Zager so he could develop a unique sonar based on the Tabunne`s ability to understand its surroundings through faint sounds. Tabunne Sonar Emitting Device used to round up the Tabunne had special sound waves that made the Tabunne gather of their own accord. The sound waves even made electronic tracking devices useless. Cilan suggested to Ash that he should send out his Roggenrola as its sense of hearing is sophisticated just like a Tabunne`s as it can sense sound waves that humans can`t hear. Ash`s Roggenrola proved that it could hear the same sound waves that were being used to control the Tabunne but it was unaffected and was successfully able to track down the Tabunne that were captured by Team Rocket. The Tabunne Sonar Emitting Device was destroyed by Ash`s Roggenrola`s Stone Edge.
Pokémon Restoration Device
In BW39, Fennel and Professor Juniper finished creating the Pokémon Restoration Device which is used to revive ancient Pokémon from fossils. The Pokémon Restoration Device was later destroyed by Archeos`s tree which resonated along with Archen`s cry. Team Rocket though was able to hack into Fennel`s computer network and copy the design data of the Pokémon Restoration Device and sent the information to Doctor Zager.
In BW78, the device was used to revive an ancient Protoga fossil and it was successful in doing so. The device was destroyed by the Protoga though moments after it was resurrected as it was angry and scared.</description>

It later attacked Ash as well but just as Ash tried to capture it with his Poké ball, it escaped. Ash decided that he still wanted to capture it as it showed a feisty fighting spirit which Ash liked. He decided to follow it into the forest.
After finding Sewaddle in the forest again, Ash showed Sewaddle that he was a good trainer by rescuing it from a surprise Woobat attack. Ash tried to rescued it again after a Patrat attempted to capture it but just before Ash showed up, Sewaddle managed to get its String Shot stuck to a passing Shikijika. It fell off a cliff into a raging river towards a waterfall but Ash went in after it. They were both rescued by Arti`s Hahakomori and Arti`s Hahakomori made a new leaf backing for Sewaddle.
Sewaddle gained Ash`s trust and was then allowed itself to be caught in a Poké ball but as Ash tried to recall it after being captured, the Poké ball wouldn`t work as Sewaddle was his 7th on hand Pokémon. Ash decided to keep his Sewaddle on his team at that time for training.</description>

<description>Cabernet is Pokémon Sommelière and a Pokémon Trainer. She managed to pass the Pokémon Sommelièr Association`s test to become a C-Class Pokémon Sommelière. Upon passing the test she decided to challenge Cilan at the Sanyo Gym for the Tri Badge. Cilan defeated her but when Cabernet returned to challenge Cilan at the gym, Chili and Cress had to explain that Cilan was on a journey and was no longer at the gym. Angry that Cilan was not the gym leader when she visited, she battled at the gym anyhow and won the Tri Badge.
Ash met her at a new Friendly Shop while on his way to Hiun City. Cabernet did a compatibility test for all of Ash`s Pokémon but she gave him low compatibility for all his Pokémon. Ash and his Pokémon were not impressed with her compatibility test skills. Cilan and Iris interrupted the compatibility test only for Cabernet to realize that she had finally found Cilan and she was now out for revenge.
Cabernet challenged Cilan to a revenge battle where she ended up loosing to him yet again. More angry than ever, she vowed to defeat Cilan the next time they met while becoming an S-class Sommelière and she took off.</description>

Years later, Sally returned to the Skyarrow Bridge the day that Ash and his friends were crossing it.

Sally saw the pictures on the stores wall of the old boat and remembered the good times she had with her Gothitelle. While attempting to cross the bridge, Ash and his friends were caught in an illusionary Time Slip created by Sally`s Gothitelle and they then saw the younger Sally there.
While Ash and his friends were battling Gothitelle in the Time Slip attempting to return back to their time, the adult Sally appeared and tried to calm her Gothitelle down by explaining that she had become a qualified doctor now and had been transferred to a hospital nearby. She calmed Gothitelle down by telling it that she missed it very much and missed the happy days they had together.</description>

Three-on-Three Battle Against Ash`s Tepig

<description>Ash`s Palpitoad was caught at a lake while Ash was enroute to Raimon City. Ash`s Oshawott was forced to battle Palpitoad because it came out of the water to protect its lake which it thought that Ash and Ash`s Oshawott were trespassing in. During the battle, Ash`s Oshawott managed to master its Aqua Jet and that proved to be the decisive factor in the battle as Palpitoad was knocked out and Ash caught it.</description>

<description>Cilan`s Stunfisk lived together with Ash`s Palpitoad in a lake near Raimon City. They were very protective of trespassers in their lake and Stunfisk used Discharge on Ash and Ash`s Oshawott to get them out of the lake. Cilan decided to get out his fishing rod to keep it occupied while Ash and Ash`s Oshawott battled the Palpitoad. Cilan ended up swinging the Stunfisk on the ground to knock it out and then caught it.
Don George Tournament - Raimon Town
Luke`s Larvesta battled against Cilan`s Stunfisk in the second round of the Don Battles Tournament in Raimon Town. Luke`s Larvesta used String Shot as an attack and a defense in the battle which showed Cilan that Luke knew how to battle with his Larvesta. When Cilan`s Stunfisk was wrapped up with String Shot, Cilan allowed it to get hit by Flamethrower to set it loose. Luke`s Larvesta ended up defeating Cilan`s Stunfisk with a powerful Flamethrower though which eliminated Cilan from the tournament.
Battle against Skyla
Skyla`s Swoobat was matched up against Cilan`s Stunfisk in Skyla`s air battle and she believed that her Swoobat would be victorious. In the actual gym battle, Cilan`s Crustle was replaced by Cilan`s Stunfisk to determine the winner of the match after it was defeated by Skyla`s Swanna. Cilan`s Stunfisk started off with a Thundershock but Skyla`s Swanna shook it off fairly easily and Skyla chastened Cilan by saying that it would take at least a Thunderbolt to affect her Swanna. Skyla`s Swanna countered with a Hurricane whic tossed Cilan`s Stunfisk into the air but wasn`t too effective against it as its actually quite mobile in the air. Cilan`s Stunfisk then used Scald which also burned Skyla`s Swanna. It appeared that Skyla`s Swanna was nearing defeat but it used Aqua Ring to heal itself and then attacked with a powerful Brave Bird and knocked out Cilan`s Stunfisk to give Skyla the victory in the match.</description>

It then battled against Iris`s Excadrill which proved to be a more balanced fight but Iris`s Excadrill would not obey commands and ended up loosing to Langley`s Beartic.</description>

Nurse Joy (Isshu) explained that she called the water department after she was experiencing problems with the water earlier that morning.
Tuttle explained that the water supply for this Pokémon Center relies on spring water from a nearby cave where many wild Dangoro live. Iris was quick to point out to him that they had seen a Dangoro earlier in the day. Tuttle decided to go check out the cave and Ash and his friends came along with him.
After dealing with Rocket Gang, Tuttle told Nurse Joy (Isshu) that he informed the water department about the situation at the cave and that they would begin the water supply restoration process immediately as well as fix the habitat for the Dangoro.</description>

<description>While stopping for some lunch on route to Raimon City, a distressed Roggenrola jumped on the table that had all the food that Cilan had prepared. Ash wasn`t certain what the Roggenrola wanted but he decided to battle it and try to get it.
While Ash and his friends went to check out the cave to see about fixing the water supply for the Pokémon Center, he reunited with the Roggenrola who was eager for them to come with it into the cave. Team Rocket had captured its friends and as they were escaping they collapsed the entrance to the cave. Rocks began falling above Roggenrola and Ash quickly rescued it from being crushed.
After Team Rocket was defeated and the Roggenrola were rescued, the wild Roggenrola challenged Ash to a battle to get it. Ash`s Tepig was sent out and after numerous Tackle attacks, managed to weaken the Roggenrola enough for Ash to get it.
Hearing/Tracking Skills
While investigating the disappearance of many Tabunne in BW38, Cilan suggested to Ash that he should send out his Roggenrola as its sense of hearing is sophisticated just like a Tabunne`s as it can sense sound waves that humans can`t hear. Ash`s Roggenrola proved that it could hear the same sound waves that were being used to control the Tabunne but it was unaffected and was successfully able to track down the Tabunne that were captured by Team Rocket. The Tabunne Sonar Emitting Device was destroyed by Ash`s Roggenrola`s Stone Edge.
Battle against Clay`s Excadrill
Ash realized that only one of his Pokémon would be able to endure the attacks from Clay`s Excadrill and keep enduring them until there was a chance to counterattack and that was Ash`s Roggenrola. Ash`s Roggenrola kept on enduring all the attacks for quite awhile until it evolved into Ash`s Boldore.</description>

While they were tracking a Tabunne in a foggy forest, Christie mistakenly thought that Ash and his friends might be related to the incidents when they saw them trying to talk to the staggering Tabunne. Christie quickly apologized for mistaking them as criminals.
She explained that he wanted to help Officer Jenny (Isshu) investigate the Tabunne incidents because a Tabunne she is good friends with disappeared. She vowed that she and her Gothita would find the culprit no matter what. She had a bit of a rivalry going on with Doyle as they both wanted to impress Officer Jenny (Isshu).
Per Officer Jenny (Isshu), Christie went to visit Mimi and her Tabunne to attach a tracking chip to its body while Iris came along with Christie. Christie believed that an evil organization wanted the Tabunne and that a Psychic type Pokémon was involved and controlling the Tabunne.
Christie relies on her Gothita`s Telekinesis for attacking as well as for strategic movements. When they were tracking the Tabunne, she told her Gothita to use Telekinesis to lift everyone over the gorge after the Tabunne wrecked the bridge so that they couldn`t get across.
After helping Ash and his friends defeat Team Rocket and rescue the Tabunne she was friends with, she was eager to ask Officer Jenny (Isshu) if her Gothita was the most helpful to show up Doyle and Doyle`s Solosis but Officer Jenny (Isshu) told her that Ash`s Roggenrola contributed the most. With a lighthearted laugh, she accepted her judgement respectfully.</description>

From that point on, Ash`s Snivy took control of the match and was able to defeat Georgia`s Pawniard which advanced Ash on to the next round in the tournament.</description>

She injured her arm in an accident and went to the hospital to get it mended and when she returned her Choroneko was gone. Cilan told her that he had seen a Choroneko and it was with his friends in the mine, so the two of them went to meet up with them in the mine.
When Misha saw her Choroneko, she immediately recognized it and quickly went over to get it but Choroneko brought out its claws and looked as if it would hurt her if she attempted to go further. Meowth was able to translate what Misha`s Purrloin`s was saying and it indicated that it thought it had been abandoned. Misha explained to her Choroneko that she`d been injured and wasn`t able to return as quickly as she`d hoped.
When Ash and his friend were beginning to fall into the rocks, she came over to help pull the rope with Cilan but the metal girting collapsed below them and they fell in as well.

Meowth instantly fell in love with Misha`s Purrloin and quickly took sides with it when the flock of Tranquill showed up. With the help of Ash`s Oshawott and Pikachu, the flock was turned away.
Meowth began to confess its love to Misha`s Purrloin but was quickly interrupted by Ash`s Oshawott who was also attracted to Misha`s Purrloin. The two of them began competing for its attention not realizing that Misha`s Purrloin was a male and was just going along with the deception for its own protection. Misha`s Purrloin was about to leave the group but it then saw a lot of berries in Ash`s backpack and it decided to stay around.

Leon is a very eccentric character who borders on megalomania. He taunts its victims and dares them to try to attempt to catch him. Leon`s Beheeyem is used to help him create dream world`s and dream world layers which makes it difficult for his victims to figure out exactly what`s going on which makes it a lot easier for him to escape.
Unfortunately for Leon, Psychic type Investigator Officer Jenny (Isshu) had been hot on his tail and was investigating psychic instances and crimes. Officer Jenny (Isshu) and her Officer Jenny`s Duosion helped rescue Pikachu, Meowth and Iris`s Axew from Leon and arrested him.</description>

Once Ash and his friends managed to break themselves free of Leon`s Beheeyem`s illusions, Pikachu was able to defeat it quite easily and it was arrested with its owner Leon by Officer Jenny (Isshu).</description>

Aside from being the Gym Leader of the Raimon Gym, Elesa is also a super-popular model who shows of various different outfits in fashion shows. She is known to be a very pretty girl and a charismatic model. She has many fans who often come to see her at her fashion shows and her gym matches.
Bianca had a magazine that had Elesa on the cover and included information about her fashion show appearances in Raimon City. When she went to have her gym battle with Elesa that she had booked, she noticed that Elesa was at a fashion show and decided to go watch her. Ash and his friends also decided to watch her as well as Cilan suggest that it would be a good idea to go to find out what kind of person she was. While modeling on the catwalk, Elesa spotted Pikachu and noted she had never seen a Pikachu before and noted it was sparkling and shining.
Gym Battle against Bianca
Both Bianca and Ash wanted to do their gym battles right away but because Bianca had made a reservation and Ash hadn`t, Bianca was first. Elesa suggested to Bianca that their Gym match be a test so show her father how much she`d grown since she`d started traveling. Ash realized that Elesa was being fair and noted that he should have made a reservation too. Elesa battle against Bianca was a lot easier than she anticipated and none of her Pokémon were knocked out.
Gym Battle against Ash
As she had just finished a gym battle with Bianca, Elesa told Ash she`d be waiting for him the next day for their gym battle as she had to take her Zebraika to the Pokémon Center. The next day, Ash proved to be a lot tougher to battle against as his Pikachu 1-hit knocked out Elesa`s Tynamo and Elesa`s Emolga on his way to victory. Elesa was extremely impressed with Ash and his Pikachu after the battle.</description>

<description>Bianca`s Shelmet was revealed during her gym battle against Elesa. Bianca captured it sometime before that battle. It didn`t last too long in the battle as Elesa`s Zebstrika was a very strong opponent which defeated it quite swiftly. To help it recover from the battle, Iris made it a remedy to restore its health. Bianca`s Shelmet was a very timid Pokémon as it was shy during battling as well as when it had to interact with anyone.
Battle against Professor Juniper`s Karrablast
Professor Juniper wanted to have a battle with her Karrablast against Bianca`s Shelmet to record their data before the evolution. Bianca agreed but the battle didn`t turn out as interesting as Cilan hoped it would. Bianca`s Shelmet kept hiding in its shell and used Protect to increase its defense. The battle was cut short when one of Professor Juniper`s assistants informed her that they were having problems at the base camp.
Link Trade Evolution
Bianca`s Shelmet was traded with Professor Juniper`s Karrablast using Professor Juniper link trade device. After solving the problems with the electrical interference the trade was successful and Bianca`s Shelmet evolved into Professor Juniper`s Accelgor while Professor Juniper`s Karrablast evolved into Bianca`s Escavalier.</description>

It didn`t seem to even battle with much effort as it swiftly defeated all of Bianca`s Pokémon.
Battle against Ash`s Palpitoad
Elesa`s Zebstrika was also used in her Gym battle against Ash`s Palpitoad. Due to Palpitoad being part Ground-type, Zebstrika was unable to use its strongest attack, Wild Charge. After dodging Palpitoad`s Mud Shot, Elesa ordered her Zebstrika to repeatedly use Flame Charge, even though it was ineffective against Ash`s Palpitoad, a part Water-type Pokémon, in order to boost its speed, and thus, it was able to dodge Palpitoad`s Hydro Pump attack. Zebstrika`s Double Kick attacks that followed made Palpitoad dizzy, and in an attempt to finish the battle, Elesa ordered Zebstrika to use Quick Attack. However, Ash`s Palpitoad endured the attack and managed to beat Elesa`s Zebstrika using a combination of its Supersonic, Hydro Pump and Mud Shot attacks.</description>

He was concerned that Bianca might be in danger and he regretted giving her permission to start her journey. Bianca`s Father is a loving father and just wants the best for his daughter. Initial impressions of him suggested he was a bit over protective but with Bianca`s clumsy nature, he just wanted to make sure he looked after her.
While he was young, he traveled on his on Pokémon journey. He was called the "Red Shooting Star" and he still continues to wears a large red scarf while battling.
Ash challenged Bianca`s Father to a Pokémon battle to allow Bianca to continue to travel. He agreed but changed the challenge to force Ash to return home to Pallet Town if he lost the battle. Even though Bianca`s Father`s Darmanitan only used Fire type moves throughout the battle, it proved to be too strong for Ash`s Oshawott. Bianca`s Father commented though that his Red Flash Hihidaruma gets more fired up the more resistance it faces and shortly after it knocked Ash`s Oshawott out. Despite loosing the battle, Bianca`s Father changed his mind because the battle with Ash and his Mijumaru made him remember the joy of traveling. Thankful that her father changed his mind, Bianca raced off to the Desert Resort to train but forgot her bag while required Bianca`s Father to go chasing after her.</description>

Pikachu one hit K.O`d Elesa`s Tynamo with a Iron Tail. The loss gave Ash the overall victory.</description>

Erina`s Axew accidentally mistook another Trainer to be Erina and got into a bit of trouble when it wouldn`t let go of the Trainer`s leg.

His Pokémon Ma-kun and Ra-kun high five while Cacchin was supposed to jump up into the air and stand on top of them and fire Sunny Day, making Petal Dance and Pin Missile shine and creating a rainbow. The whole musical routine was called "Over the Rainbow". Cacchin was having problems with the final part of the routine, so Iris`s Emolga was sent out to show it how to jump properly.
Tobio dream is to have many people gather in his hometown. His hometown is a small town with a coal mine, a small dot in the middle of a wasteland. His best memory is of a public regional performance of a Pokémon Musical that was showed when he was small. Tobio thought that the singing and the dancing were so cool. He saw a really beautiful rainbow at that performance. A few years later, the coal mine was sealed off and with each year passing, more and more people left the town. The last time the entire town was gathered was when they had that Musical.
While traveling in a wasteland one day, Tobio met a group of Maracacchi. When he looked up, there was a rainbow. He then got the idea to make a Maracacchi Musical so that it might incite many people to gather in his hometown once again. Tobio realized that the future of his hometown depended on what he called: "Trio the Maracacchi" (トリオ・ザ・マラカッチ).
After perfecting the performance due to an encounter with a Penror, Tobio and his Maracacchi with the help of Ash and his friends, succeeded with "Over the Rainbow" and won the Pokémon Performance Contest in the town and then headed of to the Pokémon Musical audition in Raimon City.

<description>Ma is one of Tobio`s larger Maractus. While en route from Raimon City to Hodomoe City, Ash and his friends stopped to watch Tobio train with his three Maracacchi. Tobio explained to them that they were practicing the climax of their performance so they could do well in a Pokémon Performance Contest that would held in the town. His Pokémon Ma-kun and Ra-kun high five while Cacchin was supposed to jump up into the air and stand on top of them and fire Sunny Day, making Petal Dance and Pin Missile shine and creating a rainbow.
While traveling in a wasteland one day, Tobio met a group of Maracacchi. When he looked up, there was a rainbow. He then got the idea to make a Maracacchi Musical so that it might incite many people to gather in his hometown once again. Tobio realized that the future of his hometown depended on what he called: "Trio the Maracacchi" (トリオ・ザ・マラカッチ).
In the triple battle against Pikachu, Ash`s Snivy and Ash`s Tepig, Tobio`s Maracacchi used some of their moves from their musical performance in the battle. It was going pretty good for them until Cacchin wasn`t able to land on Ma and Ra. After perfecting the performance due to an encounter with a Penror, Tobio and his Maracacchi with the help of Ash and his friends, succeeded with "Over the Rainbow" and won the Pokémon Performance Contest in the town as Cacchin was finally able to land on Ma and Ra.</description>

<description>Cacchin is the smallest of Tobio`s Maractus. While traveling in a wasteland one day, Tobio met a group of Maracacchi. When he looked up, there was a rainbow. He then got the idea to make a Maracacchi Musical so that it might incite many people to gather in his hometown once again. Tobio realized that the future of his hometown depended on what he called: "Trio the Maracacchi" (トリオ・ザ・マラカッチ).
Tobio practiced the climax of their performance which Cacchin played an integral part in so they could do well in a Pokémon Performance Contest that would held in the town. His Pokémon Ma-kun and Ra-kun high five while Cacchin was supposed to jump up into the air and stand on top of them and fire Sunny Day, making Petal Dance and Pin Missile shine and creating a rainbow. The whole musical routine was called "Over the Rainbow". Cacchin was having problems with the final part of the routine, so Iris`s Emolga was sent out to show it how to jump properly.
Tobio got mad at Cacchin as it wasn`t able to perfect its jump move because it was a bit scared of heights. Cacchin then ran away into the forest where it got into trouble with a wild Penror. After Tobio tried to protect Cacchin from the Penror, Cacchin came to his rescue and then ended up overcoming its fear of heights and was able to perfect the climax of the performance and land on Ma and Ra. Cacchin was able to gain confidence from that experience and was able to land the jump perfectly during the Pokémon Performance Contest.</description>

<description>Robert is a novice Pokémon photographer who met Ash and his friends at a Pokémon Center near Hodomoe City. He was amazed to see a real Pikachu in the Isshu region but Ash informed him that it came with him from the Kanto region. Robert is always seen with a digital SLR camera in hand and he also carries his photobook and his grandpa`s photobook in his backpack to show people some of the pictures. Just as he takes a picture, Robert often says `Check!` (チェック!). After hearing Ash talk about the Kanto region, Robert stated that once he had checked all Pokémon of Isshu, he might go to check the Pokémon in the Kanto region next.
Cilan and Iris couldn`t believe that Robert`s Grandpa took a picture of all four seasonal forms of Mebukijika gathered in one place. Many of Roberts friends actually called the photo a fake and this frustrated him so much that he vowed to search for the forest where his grandpa met the Mebukijika and take the same photograph, no matter what. His only clue was a picture that had a Antres flower which is very rare. Nurse Joy (Isshu) recognized the Antres flower and told Robert that they were blooming on a nearby mountain and that a lot of Shikijika and Mebukijika were also in the area. Ash and his friends decided to travel with Robert to see if they could see the four seasonal forms of Mebukijika.
With the help of Robert`s Swoobat, they were able to find an Antres flower. They decided to go to where Robert`s Swoobat found the flower but it started to get foggy. He approached an area where a bunch of Shikijika were but noticed that one of them was about to get sprayed by a Morobareru. Robert saved the Shikijika from being poisoned but he ended up getting poisoned. They didn`t have any antidote, so Ash started to carry Robert back to the Pokémon Center. While walking, they encountered the Shikijika again with a Mebukijika this time and followed them to the location that Robert`s Grandpa had once been. All four seasonal forms of Mebukijika gathered and healed Robert of his poison. Just before the Mebukijika departed, Robert managed to get a blurry picture of them. Despite the blurry picture, Robert had a wonderful experience that no one else could recreate and he was satisfied with that.</description>

At the time she met Ash and his friends, Koharu had two badges: the Basic Badge and the Insect Badge. Koharu tends to follow the will of her Gothita and spoils it a bit by abiding by whatever it wants to do despite her initial thoughts and reactions to a situation.
When Koharu`s Gothita decided that it liked Ash`s Scraggy, Koharu`s Gothita instructed Koharu to send out all her Pokémon so Ash could decide which one of her Pokémon he`d trade with. When Ash said he wasn`t willing to trade, Koharu`s Gothita got upset and in order to please it, Koharu`s attitude changed as she tried to persuade Ash by playing to his vanity. After numerous suggestions that Ash was a weak opponent, Ash agreed to battle against Koharu and if he lost he would trade his Zuruggu. Koharu lost the battle though and Ash`s Scraggy wasn`t traded to her but Koharu`s Gothita got really mad at her for losing.
Despite submitting to Koharu`s Gothita selfish attitude, Koharu seems to be a nice trainer and was planing to head to Raimon City next as she was a big fan of Elesa. Koharu was last seen chasing after her Gothita as it ran off into the distance after it lost the battle against Ash`s Snivy.</description>

<description>Koharu`s Gothita is a very selfish Pokémon who took a liking to Ash`s Scraggy. Koharu and Koharu`s Gothita form a combo and are now visiting gyms in the Unova region. Koharu`s Gothita realizes that it can get its way whenever it wants by just playing Koharu and she quickly relents and agrees to whatever it wants.
When Koharu`s Gothita decided that it liked Ash`s Scraggy, Koharu`s Gothita instructed Koharu to send out all her Pokémon so Ash could decide which one of her Pokémon he`d trade with. When Ash said he wasn`t willing to trade, Koharu`s Gothita got upset and in order to please it, Koharu`s attitude changed as she tried to persuade Ash by playing to his vanity.

Koharu lost the battle though and Ash`s Scraggy wasn`t traded to her but Koharu`s Gothita got really mad at her for losing.
Koharu`s Gothita convinced Ash`s Scraggy to come with it outside to get something to eat. They ended up getting in trouble with a Garbodor and Koharu`s Deerling to use its Aromatherapy to calm down the raging Garbodor after Ash`s Snivy had followed them to see what they were up to. Koharu`s Gothita did not like the fact that Ash`s Snivy had been looking up on them and it decided it wanted to battle it.
Battle against Ash`s Snivy
Koharu`s Gothita was quite mad at Ash`s Snivy but it didn`t stand a chance against it in battle. Ash`s Snivy barely broke a sweat as it was able to counter and avoid all of Koharu`s Gothita`s attacks before it knocked it out with its Leaf Storm. Still upset, Koharu`s Gothita ran off into the distance.</description>

Battle against Ash`s Tepig
Koharu`s Mandibuzz battled against Ash`s Tepig because Koharu`s Gothita liked Ash`s Scraggy but Ash was not willing to part with it. Koharu made a deal with Ash that if she won in a battle against him, he would be forced to trade his Zuruggu. Koharu`s Gothita chose Koharu`s Mandibuzz to battle against Ash, while Ash`s Tepig was sent out to battle against it.
Ash`s Tepig proved to be the stronger Pokémon as it was able to endure Koharu`s Mandibuzz`s Brave Bird after it hit it directly the first time but on the second attempt Ash`s Tepig countered the Brave Bird attack with its Flame Charge and knocked it out to give Ash the victory so he didn`t have to trade his Zuruggu.</description>

<description>Bobby is a Pokémon Daycare worker that has a fenced off facility near Hodomoe City. While traveling to Hodomoe City, Ash and Iris tried to catch two Monozu that were entrusted to Bobby but they escaped abruptly to search for their Trainers by breaking through the wooden wall around the Daycare that Bobby built. After rounding up the Monozu, he repaired the wall and showed Ash and his friends around his Pokémon Daycare. Bobby is a very well organized and enthusiastic worker who loves to see the smile on the Trainer`s faces when they get their Pokémon returned to them. He is also very strong as he gets quite a work out taking care of all the Pokémon and making sure they are fed.
Generally Pokémon that are dropped off get used to Bobby in about a day but Bobby has one weakness and that is that he has no experience with taking care of Dragon type Pokémon as they are delicate and their rearing is difficult. Iris told Bobby she was training to become a Dragon Master and she was from the Dragon Village and asked if she could help take care of the Monozu. Bobby was grateful for the assistance and he assigned Ash, Iris and Cilan each one of the three Monozu to look after. Bobby though wanted to make sure that they also didn`t restrain their Daycare experiences and assigned them a list of food to give to the different Pokémon as part of their Trainer studies. As thanks for their hard work, Bobby treated them to a meal prepared by him.
Bobby was able to teach Ash, Iris and Cilan a bit more about being a Pokémon Daycare worker and explained to them that taking Pokémon and sending them off again is a daycare worker`s job. He explained that if a Pokémon Daycare worker gets lonely after parting with a Pokémon, it just proves how much love the Daycare worker put into it which means that they did a good job. After parting with the Monozu they had helped take care of, Ash, Iris and Cilan each learned that lesson well from Bobby but before they went on their journey again to Hodomoe City, Bobby made sure they helped him with the Pokémon food one last time.</description>

When Ash first arrived in Driftveil City, he met Clay at the entrance to the Driftveil Gym but Clay didn`t have any time for Gym match at that moment as he had to go out and examine a new vein in a mine that he manages at the outskirts of town. Clay was a bit annoyed with Ash as he arrived at to have Gym match and didn`t even know that. Ash told Clay he`d wait for him at the Pokémon Center till he called which he did just after the training with Chili had finished up.
After Nurse Joy (Isshu) informed Ash that Clay had returned to the gym, Ash went to the gym but Clay was leaving again because he had no more Revival Herbs and he I didn`t have time for any Gym matches. Clay was a bit annoyed by Ash as he had come to his gym for a match without knowing anything about Revival Herbs. Clay told Ash that he wasn`t worth the bother as he figured he wasn`t a very good trainer for not knowing what a Revival Herb was. Clay then told Ash that they could have a battle if he brought some Revival Herbs to him and until then the Gym was closed.
Gym Battle against Ash
Ash returned to the Driftveil Gym with a bag of Revival Herbs and Clay kept his promise and they went farther underground in the mine to begin the battle. Half way through their battle, Clay thought that Ash was still naïve about become a Pokémon Master. Clay explained to Ash that when he was about his age he began excavating the mine they were in with his Doryuzu and his pickax, expanding it to its current form. Clay complained that by contrast, the youngsters like Ash were immediately talking about being Pokémon Masters and ignoring the fact that it takes a lot of work to get that far. Clay also said to Ash that as he is someone who`s made it so far that he`s called "Miner King" with a single pickax, he could teach him how hard it is to work one`s way up. Ash proved to Clay though that he was working hard towards his goal and he defeated Clay to get his fifth badge in the Unova region, the Quake badge.</description>

<description>Charles is a resident of Driftveil City who likes to ride his motorcycle around the city. He was born in Driftveil City and loves living there as he knows it inside out. The vendors at the famous Driftveil City market are good friends with Charles and are willing to give him and his friends free items. Charles is also a childhood acquaintance of Linda and he considers her to be a tough, sarcastic, energetic women who`s quite a handful. It`s unclear though if he has romantic feelings for her but he seems to like her and spend time with her especially visiting her office to use her computer on occasion.
Hero Persona A☆Gilder
Charles is the Swift Hero A☆Gilder and he dresses up in a Agilder looking suit so that he matches his Agilder. Part of the reason he has the alternate hero persona the Swift Hero A☆Gilder is because he wants to protect the city that he loves from those that would ruin it through crime. Until he rescued Linda and stopped Professor Tsurarer from controlling all the frozen ice treats and Ice Pokémon in the Unova region, he had never solved a case. Swift Hero A☆Gilder would always butting in and goof up and he had a very low popularity in this city. Charles invited Ash into the Young A-Gilder Group by attempting to give him a matching muffler and badge but he told Charles he`d join the club at a later time.
Swift Hero A☆Gilder also drives a motorcycle and Charles` Accelgor is always seen riding on the front of it. Before taking off on his bike, Swift Hero A☆Gilder always says his catch phrase: "Full speed! Full throttle!" (スピード全開 フルスロットル!). He once forgot to fill up his bike with gas while attempting to chase after a thief but events like that were common as he`s known for his minor negligence`s.
Linda knew for a while that Charles was the Swift Hero A☆Gilder but she never told him until after he rescued her. She considered him a lax hero who always needs someone`s help but she seemed willing to provide that help. Iris and Cilan both kind of figured that Charles was the Swift Hero A☆Gilder but Ash wasn`t able to figure that out until Charles confirmed Linda`s accusation. After solving the Vanipeti Freight mystery, Swift Hero A☆Gilder drove off on his bike awaiting for the next time that his services would be needed.
Revival Herbs
Ash and his friends met up with in BW61 at the the Driftveil City market when they were looking for Revival Herbs. told them that he`d ask an acquaintance of his if he had any but his friend unfortunately only had one and it was to be delivered to the Pokémon Center. suggested that something might have happened on the legendary Milos Island as it is the only place where people can get Revival Herbs. With the new information that told them, Ash and his friends went of in search of Revival Herbs on Milos Island.</description>

It proved it was a strong and powerful Pokémon on its own though when it had to face Professor Tsurarer`s Vanillish in a battle and it was able to defeat it.

Linda`s Timburr was sent out to help stop the thief until Officer Jenny (Isshu) arrived to arrest him.

While investigating the Vanipeti Freight, Linda was captured by the Vanipeti Gang and Professor Tsurarer and she was unable to stop them from attempting to create their headquarters at the warehouse.

<description>When Professor Tsurarer revealed his true, Linda and company thought that he would send out a Freegeo to battle against them because he was wearing a Freegeo mask and his persona is based off of a Freegeo but he wasn`t able to capture one as it was too strong for him to get it. Instead, his main Pokémon is a Vanirich but it was defeated by Charles.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Yuto is a resident of Milos Island in the Unova region. Yuto`s Lilligant helps him harvest Revival Herbs and he supplies them to the people of Hodomoe City and the surrounding areas. Yuto is familiar with the history of Milos Island and the many rituals that are unique to the Milos Isles. Ash and his friends went to Milos Island in search of Revival Herbs and an old lady informed them that Yuto was the one to ask as they grow in the mountains where he has a cabin. They met up with Yuto and he explained that his Dredear who looks for Revival Herbs in the forest for him was ill as well as all the Monmen which used to fly around the grassfields in this area were also ill. He explained that he`d looked everywhere for Revival herbs lately but could hardly find any and when he thought he finally did, they were all withered.
Yuto tells the legendary Milos Island and the Revival Herbs
Yuto told Ash and his friends the legend of Milos Island at his cabin. In ancient times, Milos Island got involved in a clash between the agitated god of thunder, Voltolos, and the agitated god of wind, Tornelos. The island was dragged into a dangerous situation and Landlos risked its life to calm their fight. Yuto continued to explain that Landlos was injured and the islanders helped it by giving it a Revival Herb. It regained its strength and Landlos fought off Tornelos and Voltolos. As a sign of gratitude, Landlos turned the island into fertile land and ever since then, Revival Herbs have been growing on Milos Island.
Rainmaking Ritual
Yuto knew the rainmaking ritual that was supposed to produce rain on Milos Island. He took bundles of grass to Landlos` shrine and lined them up. He lit the grass with two rocks and he explained to everyone that once the grass was burning, they`d tell Landlos their feelings through Yuto`s Gothorita so Landlos would bless them with rain on Milos Island so the land would be fertile again and the Revival Herbs would grow. The ritual that Yuto performed seemed to work until Tornelos interfered with it.
After Landlos, Voltolos and Tornelos, were all assembled and the soil became rich once again to grow Revival Herbs, Yuto wished Ash well in his Gym match and gave him a bunch of Revival Herbs. Yuto stayed up in the mountains to continue guarding the Revival Herbs for everyone.</description>

<description>Gothorita lives with Yuto on Milos Island in the Unova region and is one of his partners. Yuto explained to Ash and his friends that according to the Milos Island legend, the Pokémon which helped Landlos was a Gothimiru. Yuto`s Gothorita was out looking for a Revival Herb for Yuto as normally Yuto`s Lilligant would do the searching but it was ill at the time. Yuto introduced Ash and his friends and Yuto`s Gothorita grew fond of Iris`s Axew.

Medium Ritual
Yuto`s Gothorita also played a large role in the Medium Ritual as it was able to use its powers to convey Iris` feelings to Landlos to summon it.
It tried to help out battling against the legendary Pokémon Tornelos and Voltolos but its attacks weren`t powerful enough to do any damage to them. It was able to give the Revival Herb to Landlos to heal it just like the legend of Milos Island said and Yuto`s Gothorita was the one who lent power to it.</description>

<description>Ash realized that only one of his Pokémon would be able to endure the attacks from Clay`s Excadrill and keep enduring them until there was a chance to counterattack and that was Ash`s Roggenrola. Ash`s Roggenrola kept on enduring all the attacks for quite awhile until it evolved into Ash`s Boldore. After evolving it learned two new moves and it became even stronger than when it was a Roggenrola. The battle then turned into a frontal power match between two Pokémon with strong bodies and Ash`s Roggenrola was able to counterattack against Clay`s Excadrill. Clay`s Excadrill was unable to match the power of Ash`s Roggenrola`s Rock Smash and Clay`s Excadrill was knocked out giving Ash the overall victory in the gym battle.
Tag Battle VS Bianca and Professor Juniper
After Bianca`s Shelmet and Professor Juniper`s Karrablast evolved via link trade, Professor Juniper suggested to Bianca that they team up and have a tag battle against Ash and Cilan. Ash`s Boldore and Cilan`s Crustle had recently evolved so they decided to use them against Bianca`s Escavalier and Professor Juniper`s Accelgor. The beginning of the battle went well for Bianca and Professor Juniper as Bianca`s Escavalier`s Fury Attack was excellent but Bianca hadn`t commanded it to use it. Realizing that Bianca`s Escavalier wasn`t following commands, Ash and Cilan decided to focus their attacks on it. Professor Juniper`s Accelgor managed to protect Bianca`s Escavalier as Professor Juniper explained that tag battles were all about teamwork. Professor Juniper`s Accelgor lost a lot of stamina defending Bianca`s Escavalier after it used Substitute and Bianca`s Escavalier finally realized that it needed to listen to Bianca otherwise it would loose the battle. After Professor Juniper`s Accelgor did a quick Recover, Professor Juniper`s Accelgor and Bianca`s Escavalier started working together and they combined their Hyper Beam attacks which knocked out Ash`s Boldore. Cilan`s Crustle fought back with its powerful Rock Wrecker to knock out both Bianca`s Escavalier and Professor Juniper`s Accelgor and give Ash and Cilan the tag battle win.</description>

<description>Clay`s Excadrill was Clay`s third and final Pokémon that battle against Ash during his gym battle. Ash kept his Snivy out to battle against Clay`s Excadrill but that matchup didn`t last long as Clay`s Excadrill was able to defend against all of Ash`s Snivy`s attacks. Ash`s Snivy was quickly knocked out with a strong Horn Drill.
Battle Against Ash`s Roggenrola/Boldore
Ash realized that only one of his Pokémon would be able to endure the attacks from Clay`s Excadrill and keep enduring them until there was a chance to counterattack and that was Ash`s Roggenrola.

<description>Clay`s Palpitoad was the second Pokémon Clay used to battle against Ash during his gym battle. Clay had just lost the first round and he wanted to make sure that Ash didn`t get carried away in the battle. Iris noted that Clay`s Palpitoad seemed to be stronger than Ash`s Palpitoad while Cilan noted that not only is Clay`s Palpitoad a Ground type but it`s also a Water type so the battle for Ash`s Oshawott would be a lot tougher.
Ash decided to keep his Oshawott out to battle against Clay`s Palpitoad and right away it became evident that Clay`s Palpitoad was the stronger Pokémon as its Hydro Pump ended up being more powerful than Ash`s Oshawott Water Gun. Clay`s Palpitoad followed up with a Sludge Bomb that knocked Ash`s Oshawott`s scallsword out of its hand and just as it was retrieving it, it got hit by Clay`s Palpitoad`s Rock Smash and was knocked out.
Battle against Ash`s Snivy
After knocking out Ash`s Oshawott, Ash`s Snivy was sent out to replace it as Ash picked it because it was strong against both Ground and Water. Ash`s Snivy used Attract right at the beginning of their battle which prove to be an unexpected yet effective technique as Clay`s Palpitoad was unable to attack after the effects of Attract took hold of it. Ash`s Snivy pummeled Clay`s Palpitoad with effective Grass type attacks until it was knocked out.</description>

<description>Clay`s Krokorok was the first Pokémon Clay used to battle against Ash during his gym battle. Clay`s Krokorok was paired up against Ash`s Oshawott as Pikachu initially wanted to battle it but Ash realized that an Electric type against a Ground type would be a bad idea.
At the beginning of the battle, Clay`s Krokorok had the upper hand as its Sandstorm managed to get sand in Ash`s Oshawott`s eyes and it also made it harder for Ash`s Oshawott to accurately attack. Clay`s Krokorok managed to hit Ash`s Oshawott with a Bite and a Stone Edge attack but it wasn`t enough to knock it out. Ash`s Oshawott used Water Gun to clear up the Sandstorm and then it began its counterattack. Clay`s Krokorok was repetitively hit with multiple attacks from Ash`s Oshawott including a super effective Aqua Jet and Razor Shell combo that ended up being too much for it and it was knocked out.</description>

Professor Icarus returned to his lab with the Ligray to treat its injuries. Ligray recovered soon after the incident and decided to stay with Professor Icarus but it was very shy and timid. The two got used to each other and they decided to keep it secret from the people in Area 28 that they lived together.
Professor Icarus`s Ligray understood the fact that Professor Icarus wanted to do his research in peace so whenever the nearby residents came to his lab, Ligray would use its psionic powers to confuse them and give them headaches to they wouldn`t return.
When Ash and his friends were heading to the lab across the bridge, Professor Icarus`s Ligray saved Ash from falling through a broken board on the bridge. It also used its foresight to inform Professor Icarus when he was having tea with Ash and his friends that his UFO was about to overload and explode.
Team Rocket heard rumours of a Pokémon that was said to have come from space was in the area. They spotted Ligray and attempted to capture it but thanks to Ash and his friends they were able to rescue it. After that incident with Team Rocket, Professor Icarus stated that he was going to go to space with Ligray but Ligray indicated that it enjoyed spending time with Professor Icarus the way it was currently.</description>

<description>Cilan`s Crustle was revealed in A Seven-colored Arch (七色アーチ), the 5th overall Japanese ending for Best Wishes which first aired at the end of BW63. Cilan`s Dwebble evolved into Cilan`s Crustle during a conflict with Rocket Gang at the Electric Stone Cave in BW64.
Tag Battle VS Bianca and Professor Juniper

Battle against Skyla
Skyla`s Swanna was matched up against Cilan`s Crustle in Skyla`s air battle and she believed that her Swanna would be victorious. In the actual gym battle, Cilan`s Pansage was replaced by Cilan`s Crustle after it was knocked out and Skyla`s Swoobat was one hit knocked out by Cilan`s Crustle`s Rock Wrecker. Skyla`s Swoobat was then replaced by Skyla`s Unfezant. It didn`t fare too well against Cilan`s Crustle as Rock Wrecker hit its mark once again. Skyla`s Unfezant`s Air Slash then proved to be ineffective against Cilan`s Crustle rock. Skyla`s Unfezant was then knocked out by a combination of Cilan`s Crustle`s Shell Smash and X-Scissor to give Cilan the lead in the battle.
Skyla`s Unfezant was then replaced by Skyla`s Swanna and the match-up from Skyla`s air battle would actually take place. Despite Skyla believing that she could defeat Cilan`s Crustle by using BubbleBeam in her air battle, it didn`t prove too effective in the actual battle as Cilan`s Crustle tried to protect itself by hiding in its rock shell. Cilan`s Crustle then went on the offensive and jumped out of its shell to do another Shell Smash/X-Scissor combo, but Skyla saw it coming this time and Skyla`s Swanna countered it with a Brave Bird and knocked it out.</description>

Battle against Bianca`s Shelmet
Professor Juniper wanted to have a battle with her Karrablast against Bianca`s Shelmet to record their data before the evolution. Bianca agreed but the battle didn`t turn out as interesting as Cilan hoped it would. Bianca`s Shelmet kept hiding in its shell and used Protect to increase its defense. The battle was cut short when one of Professor Juniper`s assistants informed her that they were having problems at the base camp.
Link Trade Evolution
Bianca`s Shelmet was traded with Professor Juniper`s Karrablast using Professor Juniper link trade device. After solving the problems with the electrical interference the trade was successful and Bianca`s Shelmet evolved into Professor Juniper`s Accelgor while Professor Juniper`s Karrablast evolved into Bianca`s Escavalier.</description>

<description>Professor Cedric Juniper is the father of Professor Juniper. He studies Legendary Pokémon in the Unova region as well as the Hero`s legend. He keeps a study notebook with him at all times for reference while exploring ruins and ancient artifacts. His fountain pen was recovered by his daughter after it got stuck in a Klinklang gear when Ash`s Krokorok initially picked it up but didn`t find it interesting and it threw it unknowingly at Klinklang. Professor Juniper noted that her father has the tenancy to loose his train of thought midway through his sentences which often makes people assume what he is going to say but their assumptions are not always what he intends to say.
Professor Cedric Juniper was studying some ruins associated with the Hero`s legend which were recently discovered and while heading to the ruins he got lost inside the cave. After reuniting with his daughter who was studying the Electric Stone Cave nearby, he agreed to take Ash and his friends with him on his adventure to the ruins as he wanted to see the ruins with his own eyes as quickly as possible because he thought that it might be the place where the Hero and Zekrom communicated.
Black Chapter of the Pokémon Mythology (ポケモン神話 黒の章):
Parts of the Hero`s legend are recorded in the Black Chapter of the Pokémon Mythology and Professor Cedric Juniper is well versed in what the legend says. He quoted two verses from the it.
The Basics of Adventure
While exploring the ruins with Ash and his friends, there were various traps that Professor Cedric Juniper had identified and knew how to avoid but the kids often didn`t wait for him to finish talking before acting and they ended up springing the traps in the ruins. He had a bunch of adventure rules that he told them which ending up being good advice to follow.
Despite telling Ash and his friends being told not to touch or take the Golden Dark Stone due to an obvious trap, Professor Cedric Juniper ended up taking it and they were chased through the ruins until they reached the underground area where the hero met Zekrom. Professor Cedric Juniper discovered ancient murals on the ceiling and after discovering them he returned the Golden Dark Stone and his adventure with Ash and his friends through the ruins was complete. Professor Cedric Juniper decided to stay though and continue his investigation of the ruins.</description>

<description>Ash`s Krokorok was Pikachu rival. Ash`s Krokorok evolved from Sunglasses Sandile during a battle against Pikachu at the end of BW20 after they had dealt with the troublesome Ducklett`s. Pikachu`s Electro Ball collided with Krokorok`s Stone Edge which created a large blast that sent Krokorok flying into the air and they were unable to finish the battle. Krokorok wanted to continue its rivalry with Pikachu and after it recovered from the blast that sent it flying it began its search for Pikachu. It continued to be a wild Pokémon for a significant amount of time.
When Krokorok finally met up with Ash and Pikachu again while they were on route for Fukiyose City, Krokorok explained to them that it had been following them during their travels and it tried to meet up with them at Raimon City and the Electric Stone Cave but it always got there a bit too late and they had moved on. It had also watched part of the final round of the Don George tournament where Pikachu was matched up against Iris`s Excadrill. While in the Electric Stone Cave, Krokorok found Professor Cedric Juniper`s fountain pen and tossed it away. The pen was later recovered by Professor Juniper who found it stuck in a Klinklang gear.
Double Battle Against Thane`s Father`s Scolipede and Thane`s Father`s Seismitoad
Glen wanted to have a double battle with Nick (Unova) and Pikachu, so Krokorok volunteered to battle on Pikachu`s team. Glen commanded both Thane`s Father`s Scolipede and Thane`s Father`s Seismitoad in a double battle against Pikachu and Ash`s Krokorok.
Thane attempted to help out by giving Glen advice by specifically telling him to match up Thane`s Father`s Seismitoad against Pikachu because of the type advantage but Glen wouldn`t take the advice. The inexperience of Glen and his unwillingness to accept advice proved to be the reasons that Thane`s Father`s Scolipede and Thane`s Father`s Seismitoad lost the battle. Pikachu and Krokorok proved to be strong opponents and they easily won the match regardless.
Rival Battle vs Pikachu
After the double battle between Thane`s Father`s Scolipede and Thane`s Father`s Seismitoad was completed, Krokorok challenged Pikachu to finish their match that they started earlier in the day but was cut short as yet another Electro Ball/Stone Edge blast had sent them both flying in different directions. Ash`s strategy of aiming Thunderbolt at Krokorok`s proved to be very effective as it created a hole in the ground that Krokorok tripped into leaving it vulnerable to Pikachu`s Iron Tail which ended up knocking out Krokorok. The first fully completed battle between Pikachu and Krokorok had finally ended with Pikachu winning.
Demoralized by the loss, the Sunglasses Krokorok began to leave but Ash invited it to join him on his journey with Pikachu and it happily agreed and was captured by Ash.
Gym Battle against Skyla`s Swoobat
In Skyla`s air battle simulation, Skyla`s Swoobat was matched up against Ash`s Krokorok and because Ground type attacks wouldn`t have any effect on her Swoobat, she gave it the victory. In the actual gym battle, Skyla`s Swoobat and Ash`s Krokorok were the first match-up and Ash`s Krokorok wasn`t able to hit Skyla`s Swoobat at all. Cilan noted though that if Stone Edge hit completely, the taste of the battle might have changed. This was the first gym battle for Ash`s Krokorok and it ended in a loss but everyone including Ash seemed to think it did well despite the obvious type disadvantage.</description>

<description>Nick is an aspiring Pokémon Trainer who caught Pikachu after it flew into the air during a battle against the Sunglasses Krokorok. Nick plans to travel through many different cities, meet lots of Pokémon, get them and make friends with them when he`s a Pokémon Trainer! He is a young boy who is friends with Glen and Thane.
Nick (Unova) initially thought he had discovered a new Pokémon species and due to the fact that he was shocked by Thunderbolt, he thought that Pikachu was the pre-evolved form of Zekrom. He took Pikachu to his friends and said its was his dad`s Pokémon. When it was identified as a Pikachu, he was a bit disappointed it wasn`t as rare a Pokémon as he initially thought. He then met up with Ash who was reunited with Pikachu. After Glen came looking for Nick so they could have their battle together, Ash agreed to let Nick use Pikachu in the battle.
Double Battle against Glen
After Thane`s Father`s Blitzle and Thane`s Father`s Patrat were too tired to battle, Thane went back to his dad and borrowed Thane`s Father`s Scolipede and Thane`s Father`s Seismitoad so he and his friends could continue battling. Glen commanded both of the Pokémon in a double battle against Pikachu and Ash`s Krokorok.
Thane attempted to help out by giving Glen advice by specifically telling him to match up Thane`s Father`s Seismitoad against Pikachu because of the type advantage but Glen wouldn`t take the advice. The inexperience of Glen and his unwillingness to accept advice proved to be the reasons that Thane`s Father`s Scolipede and Thane`s Father`s Seismitoad lost the battle.
Nick won the double battle and he was quite moved to have participated in a simulated Pokémon battle. He fought against Glen the best that he could but Glen got a bit upset that he lost. Ash made Glen apologize and the two of them continued to be friends. Nick and his friends hoped to have another Pokémon battle someday against each other. After watching the Pikachu and Ash`s Krokorok battle each other, Nick was even more moved to become a Pokémon Trainer someday.</description>

In the first battle against Thane, Glen pushed Thane`s Father`s Patrat and Thane`s Father`s Blitzle to the point of exhaustion before he finally decided to stop the battle. He then told Thane to get some more of his fathers Pokémon so they could continue battling. Not wanting to disappoint Glen or make him mad, Thane went to go get them and Glen went to go look for Nick who had shown them Pikachu earlier and had initially wanted to battle.

<description>Skyla is the Gym Leader of Mistralton Gym and those that defeat her in battle are given the Jet Badge. Her grandfather explained to Ash and his friends that Skyla is such an amazing battler that challengers from all over the Unova region came flooding in to battle her but she became so busy that she couldn`t fly her beloved airplanes any longer. She then devised air battles to save her time battling against all the challengers as she efficiently judged the challengers and their Pokémon by doing simulated battles in her head. If they won the simulation, she would award them the badge.
Gym Battle against Cilan
After watching Skyla perform `air battles`, Cilan got very upset that she was not actually doing the battles and he challenged her to a battle. Cilan agreed to do an `air battle` with her and she determined that he would loose the battle against her with the Pokémon he had chosen to battle her with. Cilan though wanted to have a real battle with her a he explained to her that with Pokémon battle, like any meal, must be tasted first before people can be certain to know anything. Skyla agreed and Cilan thought that he would be able to show her up by defeating her in a real battle and showing how her `air battles` are flawed. Unfortunately Cilan ended up loosing to Skyla but Ash challenged her to a battle right after.
Gym Battle against Ash
After the crowd and her grandfather convinced her to battle against Ash, Skyla did an air battle against Ash`s selected Pokémon and she said she`d beat him. Ash wanted to battle her right away after hearing that but she told him she`d battle him at noon the next day. Ash was able to prove to Skyla the efforts of a Trainer and their Pokémon can bring about unexpected developments that her air battles couldn`t account for. She then agreed to do proper Gym battles instead of air battles from that point on.</description>

<description>After Ash`s Tranquill replaced Pikachu in the final match-up in the gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was overpowered by Skyla`s Swanna`s Hurricane and was knocked down hard to the ground. Ash`s Unfezant then evolved from Ash`s Tranquill and proved it was stronger and faster than Skyla`s Swanna.
Gym Battle against Skyla`s Swanna
Ash dex and Cilan both noted that Ash`s Unfezant was female so it should be able to match or even surpass Swanna`s flying abilities. It also learned the new move Aerial Ace. After a short battle based on speed and air maneuvers, Ash`s Unfezant used its new move Aerial Ace and managed to catchup and hit Skyla`s Swanna in the air. The direct hit proved to be too much for it it and Skyla`s Swanna was knocked out and Ash ended up the overall victor of the gym battle. Ash`s Unfezant proved that it evolving brought in an unexpected element that Skyla could never have predicted in her air battle simulations.</description>

<description>Mile is Skyla`s grandfather and the former Fukiyose Gym Leader. Once he retired from being the Gym Leader, he started the Fukiyose Cargo Service that he`d always dreamed of running. The Cargo Service seems to run out of the same building that the Gym is still located in as Iris read the sign outside the building which says "Fukiyose Cargo Service" (フキヨセカーゴサービス). He was the referee for both Cilan and Ash`s battles against Skyla.
Mile had been quite concerned about his granddaughter Skyla`s `air battles` as he didn`t seem to approve of her doing them against challengers despite the fact that it saved her time battling the numerous challengers. Skyla told him that she didn`t need to work so hard if she could accurately predict the outcome. She had watched her grandpa`s old battle video and also told him that passionate battles that smell of sweat are a thing of the past. After he realized that Ash and Cilan did not approve of her `air battles`, he told Ash that if he wanted to do a real battle that he should go to another gym but both of them didn`t want to go after hearing she was actually a really good battler. Mile hoped that Cilan or Ash would be able to show Skyla that battles don`t always end up as she might predict.
Fukiyose Tower Bell of Wishes Festival
Mile presided over and was the only judge of the Fukiyose Tower Bell of Wishes Festival. He explained the flow of the tournament to the contestants which required them to overcome several hurdles on their way. He explained that the the first one to reach the goal on the roof of the Fukiyose Tower wins the festival tournament and would be given the right to ring the Bell of Wishes. During the quiz he was going to pick Nurse Joy (Isshu) as the girl he preferred the most but Reiji`s Elgyem changed his mind to Officer Jenny (Isshu) and Mile was a bit confused with his choice. During the imitation competition he informed Cilan that he was a very big Elesa fan and he had to be very strict with imitations of her. Ash and Pikachu were neck and neck with Stephan and Stephan`s Sawk until the very end when Stephan`s Litwick candle ended up being a real Litwick and blew out Ash`s candle flame to give Stephan the victory. Despite the controversy, Mile declared Stephan the victor.</description>

<description>Skyla`s Swoobat tends to be the first Pokémon she uses in actual battles as she used it first against Cilan and Ash. People call Skyla`s Swoobat the black courting heart as it emits sound waves of various frequencies from its nostril. Skyla believes that her Swoobat is very powerful against Bug or Fire types as she would give it the victory in her Gym air battles.
Battle against Cilan
Skyla`s Swoobat was matched up against Cilan`s Stunfisk in Skyla`s air battle and she believed that her Swoobat would be victorious. In the actual gym battle, Skyla`s Swoobat was matched up against Cilan`s Pansage. It proved to be very fast in the air and easily dodged all of Cilan`s Pansage`s attacks. It only used two attacks against Cilan`s Pansage: a Air Cutter and a Gust attack before it knocked it out and gave Skyla the victory in the first round. Cilan`s Pansage was replaced by Cilan`s Crustle and Skyla`s Swoobat was one hit knocked out by Rock Wrecker.
Gym Battle against Ash
In Skyla`s air battle simulation, Skyla`s Swoobat was matched up against Ash`s Krokorok and because Ground type attacks wouldn`t have any effect on her Swoobat, she gave it the victory. In the actual gym battle, Skyla`s Swoobat and Ash`s Krokorok were the first match-up and Ash`s Krokorok wasn`t able to hit Skyla`s Swoobat at all. Cilan noted though that if Stone Edge hit completely, the taste of the battle might have changed. This was the first gym battle for Ash`s Krokorok and it ended in a loss but everyone including Ash seemed to think it did well despite the obvious type disadvantage.
Ash`s Tranquill was then matched up against Skyla`s Swoobat who had just defeated Ash`s Krokorok. At first, Skyla`s Swoobat and Ash`s Tranquill moves seemed to be equally matched but Ash realized that they wouldn`t loose in a speed battle and a combo of Wing Attack and Air Cutter knocked out Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla pitted its loss on the fact that her Swoobat had already gone through one match, so it had a disadvantage.</description>

Skyla believes that her Unfezant is very powerful against Bug or Fire types as she would give it the victory in her Gym air battles.
Battle against Cilan
Skyla`s Unfezant was matched up against Cilan`s Pansage in Skyla`s air battle and she believed that her Unfezant would be victorious. In the actual gym battle, Skyla`s Swoobat was replaced by Skyla`s Unfezant. It didn`t fare too well against Cilan`s Crustle as Rock Wrecker hit its mark once again. Skyla`s Unfezant`s Air Slash then proved to be ineffective against Cilan`s Crustle rock. Skyla`s Unfezant was then knocked out by a combination of Cilan`s Crustle`s Shell Smash and X-Scissor to give Cilan the lead in the battle.
Battle against Ash
In Skyla air battle simulation, Ash`s Tranquill was matched up against Skyla`s Unfezant and since her Pokémon was the highest evolved form, she determined that her Pokémon would be the winner in that match-up. In the actual gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was up against Skyla`s Unfezant which was the match-up just after Ash`s Tranquill had defeated Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla`s Unfezant proved to be stronger and faster than Ash`s Tranquill, so Ash recalled it and set out Pikachu. Pikachu had a definite advantage over Skyla`s Unfezant with its electric attacks and it quickly knocked it out with its Electro Ball attack.</description>

Skyla believes that her Swanna is very powerful against Bug or Fire types as she would give it the victory in her Gym air battles.
Battle against Cilan
Skyla`s Swanna was matched up against Cilan`s Crustle in Skyla`s air battle and she believed that her Swanna would be victorious. In the actual gym battle, Skyla`s Unfezant was replaced by Skyla`s Swanna after it was defeated by Cilan`s Crustle and the match-up from Skyla`s air battle would actually take place. Despite Skyla believing that she could defeat Cilan`s Crustle by using BubbleBeam in her air battle, it didn`t prove too effective in the actual battle as Cilan`s Crustle tried to protect itself by hiding in its rock shell. Cilan`s Crustle then went on the offensive and jumped out of its shell to do another Shell Smash/X-Scissor combo, but Skyla saw it coming this time and Skyla`s Swanna countered it with a Brave Bird and knocked it out.
Cilan`s Crustle was then replaced by Cilan`s Stunfisk to determine the winner of the match. Cilan`s Stunfisk started off with a Thundershock but Skyla`s Swanna shook it off fairly easily and Skyla chastened Cilan by saying that it would take at least a Thunderbolt to affect her Swanna. Skyla`s Swanna countered with a Hurricane whic tossed Cilan`s Stunfisk into the air but wasn`t too effective against it as its actually quite mobile in the air. Cilan`s Stunfisk then used Scald which also burned Skyla`s Swanna. It appeared that Skyla`s Swanna was nearing defeat but it used Aqua Ring to heal itself and then attacked with a powerful Brave Bird and knocked out Cilan`s Stunfisk to give Skyla the victory in the match.
Battle against Ash
Just after Pikachu ended up knocking out Skyla`s Unfezant, Skyla`s Swanna was sent out to battle against it. Skyla had been watching her grandpa`s battle videos and noticed that he used the move Aqua Ring to defend against Electric attacks. She used that same defense against Pikachu which nullified its Electric attacks. It`s Iron Tail also couldn`t hit it so high in the air. Ash then noticed the rings in the air and Pikachu jumped up on them and managed to hit Skyla`s Swanna but not directly. Pikachu was now up in the air though and Skyla`s Swanna had the advantage there and it quickly knocked Pikachu out with a powerful Brave Bird attack.
After Ash`s Tranquill replaced Pikachu in the final match-up in the gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was overpowered by Skyla`s Swanna`s Hurricane and was knocked down hard to the ground. Ash`s Tranquill then evolved into Ash`s Unfezant and proved it was stronger and faster than Skyla`s Swanna. Ash dex and Cilan both noted that Ash`s Unfezant was female so it should be able to match or even surpass Swanna`s flying abilities. It also learned the new move Aerial Ace.

<description>Reiji was a participant in the Fukiyose Tower Bell of Wishes Festival that was conducted by Mile. Reiji is a `Psychic` who uses his Pokémon partner Ligray`s powers to make it seem like he has psionic powers of his own. As part of his `Psychic` persona, he will often get Ligray to change or read the minds of others to help benefit him. He has a bit of a superiority complex and he goes out of his way to use psionic powers for remedial tasks that otherwise did not need such an ability. Reiji and Reiji`s Elgyem were paired up together for the Fukiyose Tower Bell of Wishes Festival tournament.
Reiji interjected during the trivia quiz when Cilan and his friends where trying to figure out which girl Mile liked the best as it really was a very subjectional question. Reiji `proofed` his psionic powers to Cilan and his friends by getting his Ligray to change the mind of Mile to Officer Jenny (Isshu) so that they would get the question right. Mile was a bit confused after that round of the trivia quiz and Cilan seemed to notice Reiji`s Elgyem use its abilities to affect Mile.
In the scavenger hunt portion of the festival tournament, Reiji made a TwistedSpoon from an ordinary spoon using Reiji`s Elgyem powers. In the tub race, Reiji`s Elgyem used Psychic and lifted the boat above the water and they won that race. In the imitation portion of the tournament, Reiji was supposed to dress-up like Officer Jenny (Isshu) while Reiji`s Elgyem was supposed to dress-up like Officer Jenny`s Herdier but neither of the got dressed and they just walked out on stage in their normal clothes. Reiji`s Elgyem once again used its psionic powers on Mile to make it seem like they were dressed up. Mile accepted their dress-up and passed them onto the next round despite Iris` protests. Reiji and Reiji`s Elgyem also won the forest of trials obstacle course and were entered into the finals.
In the candle race, Reiji and Reiji`s Elgyem made it to the top first where they faced the flock of Pidove. Reiji thought he was smart by getting his Ligray to use Light Screen. It worked well against Gust but once they switched to Air Slash, it broke through and put out the candles flame and eliminated Reiji from the tournament.</description>

<description>Akkie participated in the Don George Donamite Tournament where he was paired up against Ash in the third match of the first round. He used his Yanakkie against Ash`s Scraggy. Freddy introduced Akkie by saying that his "moves shine like his pompadour".
In the beginning of the match, when ordered to use Leer, Zuruggu mistakenly rushed up to Akkie and used the move on him instead, which provoked a scoffing remark from him about Ash`s Scraggy. Akkie`s Yanakkie proved to be really strong, and even though Zuruggu managed to avoid taking damage from its Seed Bomb, Low Sweep and Shadow Claw moves at first, Yanakkie cleverly managed to cause a lot of damage to it by preventing it from defending itself when it used Low Sweep on Zuruggu after stepping on its foot. Zuruggu, however, was also shown to be a tough opponent for Yanakkie, when it managed to avoid Akkie`s Yanakkie`s Giga Impact attack by using Hi Jump Kick.
After Zuruggu failed to use Hi Jump Kick twice in a row and took heavy damage due to missing its target, Akkie ordered his Yanakkie to use Low Sweep repeatedly on Ash`s Scraggy. Before Yanakkie got the chance to finish off Zuruggu with its Giga Impact attack, though, Zuruggu managed to fight back with focus at Satoshi`s command, learning Focus Blast in the process and stopping Yanakkie in its tracks. In the end, even though the newly-learned move`s accuracy proved to not be all that good, Ash`s Scraggy managed to beat Akkie`s Yanakkie with a Leer and Headbutt combo.
Akkie was also seen cheering for Bakkie in her battle against Ash along with Chakkie.</description>

Masaomi`s Nageki has picked up on Masaomi`s attitude and the two of them seem to be able to play off of each other without actually having to speak as it was evident when Masaomi`s Nageki tried to intimidate Stephan`s Sawk.
Donamite Tournament
In the first round of the Donamite Tournament, Masaomi faced Domon. Masaomi`s Nageki faced Domon`s Mienshao and showed its incredible strength by using a three move combo: Superpower, Seismic Toss and the finishing move Circle Throw.

Freddy called Edmond the gray, cloudy rain man and just as his battle was about to start, clouds appeared and it started to rain. His personality seems somewhat creepy and dark similar to how it is on a gloomy and rainy day. Edmond`s Seismitoad is a perfect match for him as it Ability is Swift Swim so when it rains, its speed increases. Since Edmond seems to be able to summon rain, Edmond`s Seismitoad greatly benefits.
Initially the battle went well as Edmond`s Seismitoad `s speed made it hard for Stephan`s Sawk to hit it. The two Pokémon began having a rally of heavy blows, trying to stop one another but it wasn`t until Stephan`s Sawk successfully hit it with a Low Sweep and injured it a bit, that Edmond`s Seismitoad `s speed decreased. Edmond noted that with its speed, it should be able to dodge attacks but the injury proved to be the turning point in the match and Stephan`s Sawk was able to Bulk Up and then finished it with a Close Combat. Edmond was eliminated from the Don George Donamite Tournament by Stephan in the first round.</description>

<description>Ferris is an amateur archeologist who lives near Twist Mountain. He had been searching in the mines of the mountain looking for ancient Pokémon fossils when he made a huge discovery. Until the day Ferris found a Protoga fossil, there had been rumors that there were no fossils on Twist Mountain.
As a young boy, he and his friends, including Sierra, often used to play together on Twist Mountain where they formed the Twist Mountain Detective Group and conducted missions together. They even entered an off-limits zone once, which caused them to get scolded pretty badly but Ferris met a real Protoga after he fell through a space-time distortion and was sent back to the ancient world. Ferris befriended a wild Protoga after he helped protect if from being injured by a flock of Archen. He gave it his pendant before returning back to the present world. The Protoga fossil he dug up ended up being that same Protoga that he befriended as it still had the pendant.
After Rocket Gang resurrected the Protoga from the fossil, Ferris became friends with Protoga again and it wasn`t until after it had evolved into an Abagoura that it recognized the adult Ferris as the same person it befriended years earlier. With the help of Ash and his friends, Abagoura was returned to its own time with its friends and Ferris was able to prove to Sierra finally what he had said for years was actually true.</description>

<description>While at the Astilbe Town Pokémon Center, Ash`s Tepig noticed Suwama and came up to it. After talking with Ash and his friends, he realized that this was the Tepig he`d let go. Ash wanted to prove to Suwama that Tepig was a strong Pokémon and they decided to have a battle with Ash`s Tepig as the focus. During the battle, Ash`s Tepig evolved into Ash`s Pignite. After Ash`s Pignite defeated Suwama, Suwama realized how much stronger Ash`s Pignite had become and he tried to get it to join him again thinking that it would want to rejoin him despite the fact that he had rejected him a second time the day before. Ash`s Pignite pretended that he was interested for a few moments before blowing fire into Suwama`s face. Suwama ran off in psychotic pain while telling Ash`s Pignite to remember him.
Gym Battle against Brycen
Ash`s Pignite was then sent out to battle Brycen`s Cryogonal and like Ash`s Scraggy, it had a hard time attacking and defending against Rapid Spin. The Rapid Spin was strengthened to ward off and mitigate disadvantageous moves and Brycen countermeasures were almost perfect. It wasn`t until Ash realized they could use Fire Pledge at the center of the rotation of Rapid Spin to knock it off. The strategy worked and Brycen`s Cryogonal was knocked out.
Brycen`s Beartic replaced Brycen`s Cryogonal and Ash`s Pignite quickly found itself being outmatched despite the type advantage. Brycen`s Beartic used Brine and Aerial Ace to quickly knock Ash`s Pignite out.</description>

He`s known to lie, bully and show no compassion.
He had a double battle against Kenso at the Astilbe Town Battle Club.

Trial
While at the Astilbe Town Pokémon Center, Ash`s Tepig noticed Suwama and came up to it. After talking with Ash and his friends, he realized that this was the Tepig he`d let go. Suwama was put on trial by Cilan after he revealed that he was a Trial Sommelier. He presented himself as an impartial courtroom judge in the Karakusa Town Pokabu Abandonment case where Prosecutor Ash told about the cruel abandonment of Ash`s Tepig where it had a rope tied up around its mouth. The defendant Suwama told a different story though as he said that forcing a talentless Pokémon into futile battles is crueler. Unable to make a decision in the case, Don George suggested that the verdict be decided with a battle and Cilan agreed.
While he initially told Cilan that the reason he abandoned Tepig was because he thought it was even more cruel to let a weak Pokémon battle, he actually pretended to suffer as well by having to give Tepig up as Suwama realized most Pokémon give up if he acted like the farewell pained him too. Suwama has obviously let go of many Pokémon he deemed too weak to be with him. Suwama was actually relieved when he was finally rid of Tepig.
Battle against Ash`s Tepig
For most of the battle Ash`s Tepig did not attack and Ash`s Snivy had to carry the battle until it was knocked out. Ash`s Tepig evolved into Ash`s Pignite and then quickly overpowered Suwama Pokémon to win the battle. After Ash`s Pignite defeated Suwama, Cilan said the battle had a superb taste and that there`s no need to hand down a verdict as it`s obvious that Ash and Ash`s Tepig were right.
Suwama realized how much stronger Ash`s Pignite had become and he tried to get it to join him again thinking that it would want to rejoin it after he had rejected him a second time the day before. Ash`s Pignite pretended that he was interested for a few moments before blowing fire into Suwama`s face. Suwama ran off in psychotic pain while telling Ash`s Pignite to remember him.</description>

Suwama`s Heatmor knocked them both to the ground and then Suwama`s Emboar knocked them both out at the same time with a powerful Hammer Arm.
Double Battle against Ash`s Tepig and Ash`s Snivy
Ash wanted to prove to Suwama that Tepig was a strong Pokémon and they decided to have a battle with Ash`s Tepig as the focus. Ash`s Tepig didn`t battle until Ash`s Snivy ended up getting knocked out. Right after that though, Ash`s Tepig evolved into Ash`s Pignite. After Ash`s Pignite defeated Suwama, Suwama realized how much stronger Ash`s Pignite had become and he tried to get it to join him again thinking that it would want to rejoin him despite the fact that he had rejected him a second time the day before. Ash`s Pignite pretended that he was interested for a few moments before blowing fire into Suwama`s face. Suwama ran off in psychotic pain while telling Ash`s Pignite to remember him.</description>

<description>Brycen is the Gym Leader of the Icirrus Gym located in Icirrus City. His specializes in Ice type Pokémon and those that defeat him in a gym battle are awarded the Freeze Badge.
Brycen is a movie star that made his vivid debut in a movie called "Freeze, Tunbear" ("Freeze, Tunbear" is based off of the movie Enter the Dragon). "Freeze, Tunbear" was a huge, worldwide hit as it was the first proper martial arts movie using physical fights. Brycen`s Beartic also played a co-starting role in the movie as well as his other movies "The Path to the Ice" and "Iron Fist of Ice". Those two movies were also huge hits and the cause of long waiting lines at the theaters.
"Freeze, Tunbear", is set on a lonely island far off in the sea, dominated by an evil organization. A martial arts tournament is scheduled to open on said island and Brycen participates. Awaiting him there was the strongest Tunbear. However, having gained respect for each other through fighting, a friendship blossomed between Brycen and Tunbear and at the end, they combine forces to crushingly defeat the evil organization! However, even though production of the sequel, "Ice Games" had already already started, Brycen suddenly quit and didn`t show himself in front of fans any more. Cilan found out that the reason for not filming was because there was an accident while they were shooting the movie, so Brycen decided to do some training with Tunbear in the mountains.
Gym Battle against Ash
After showing Ash and his friends so many things like his training and battling, Brycen revealed to them that he was the Icirrus Gym leader and that he`d be looking forward to battling against Ash. As an Ice type trainer, his entire battlefield was ice and all his Pokémon that battled against Ash were ice type. Ash proved to be a strong competitor for Brycen and after a spirited battle with Ash`s Krokorok defeating Brycen`s Beartic in the final match-up, Brycen congratulated Ash and awarded him the Freeze Badge.</description>

<description>Brycen`s Beartic is Brycen main companion Pokémon. It is quite a famous Pokémon as it was featured in the movies "Freeze, Tunbear", "The Path to the Ice" and "Iron Fist of Ice", which were all huge hits and the cause of long waiting lines at the theaters.
Brycen was training with his Beartic when it rescued Ash and his friends from being crushed by a rock trap that Rinzo set. Later, when confronting Rinzo`s Jellicent ♂ and Rinzo`s Jellicent ♀, it showed how strong it was by taking them both out while aiming so that Rinzo went into his cage with them where he would wait to be arrested.
Gym Battle against Ash`s Krokorok
After Ash had knocked out Brycen`s Vanillish and Brycen`s Vanillish, Brycen`s Beartic managed to knock out Ash`s Pignite which left him with just his Ash`s Krokorok who had already battled against Brycen`s Vanillish. Seeing Brycen`s Beartic made Ash`s Krokorok want to become stronger itself and Ash`s Krokorok was were waiting for this battle. It had a type advantage in the battle and together with Ash, they battled with all their strength. Brycen`s Beartic used Icicle Crash as a defense against Stone Edge. Ash was able to counter that though by remembering Bianca`s Emboar method that she used at the Donamite and Ash`s Krokorok picked up a stray rock and jumped into the air to meet Brycen`s Beartic for one final attack. The two of them collided in the air but Ash`s Krokorok was the one that ended up victorious by defeating Brycen`s Beartic.</description>

<description>After Ash`s Scraggy defeated Brycen`s Vanillish, Brycen`s Cryogonal was sent out to battle. Ash`s Scraggy wasn`t able to defend itself against Brycen`s Cryogonal`s very fast and accurate Rapid Spin. It also made it hard for Ash`s Scraggy to attack it. Ash`s Scraggy ended up getting knocked out by Aurora Beam.
Ash`s Pignite was then sent out to battle Brycen`s Cryogonal and like Ash`s Scraggy, it had a hard time attacking and defending against Rapid Spin. The Rapid Spin was strengthened to ward off and mitigate disadvantageous moves and Brycen countermeasures were almost perfect. It wasn`t until Ash realized they could use Fire Pledge at the center of the rotation of Rapid Spin to knock it off. The strategy worked and Brycen`s Cryogonal was knocked out.</description>

<description>Brycen`s Vanillish was the first Pokémon Brycen sent out and Ash countered with his Krokorok. Astonish was an effective way to make Ash`s Krokorok flinch, preventing it from attacking. When Ash`s Krokorok broke free, it tried to dig into the ice but halfway down Brycen`s Vanillish Blizzard froze the bottom part of Ash`s Krokorok. Ash knew he couldn`t continue on like this and he recalled Krokorok.
Ash`s Scraggy was then sent out for its first gym battle. It started off by hurting its knee when it missed with its Hi Jump Kick but it was able to surprise Brycen by defending itself against attacks by pulling up its skin to protect itself. From that point on Ash`s Scraggy dominated the battle and was able to finish off Brycen`s Vanillish with an effective Headbutt.</description>

He has fairly large estate that is walled and gated so it doesn`t allow anyone unwanted on his property. He is obviously a very rich person as he has an expensive car and can afford a personal butler.
Hattori suggested that Cilan and Pinot Noir have a Pokémon battle to determine which A-class Pokémon Sommelier would get to choose the Pokémon for Momotchi. He seemed very excited to get to see a battle between two A-class Pokémon Sommeliers in his own backyard. He seemed to favor Pinot Noir`s choice of Tuline and hoped that Pinot Noir would win the battle. After Cilan won the battle and explained why Tamagetake was the best choice for his daughter, Hattori apologized to his daughter and allowed her to be best friends with the Tamagetake.</description>

<description>Pinot Noir is the other A-class Pokémon Sommelier other than Cilan that Hattori invited to be brought to his house so that they could determine which Pokémon would be best for Momotchi first Pokémon. Pinot Noir described himself as having outstanding intelligence, stamina, observing eyes and expressiveness. He already had heard about Cilan and how he was an excellent Pokémon Sommelier despite his young age. Pinot Noir appears to be middle aged and has had a lot of experience as being a Pokémon Sommelier.
During his tasting time, Pinot Noir determined that what is important for a first Pokémon is the coordination with its Trainer and that a marriage in which each makes the other look cuter and more beautiful would be ideal. He believed that Tuline was the most suitable candidate for Momotchi as the prettiness unique to Grass types, the cute appearance and the possibility of a gorgeous evolution were all perfectly suited for her. Cilan didn`t completely disagree with Pinot Noir`s choice though but he sensed that it wasn`t a perfect selection.
Pokémon battle vs Cilan
Despite their disagreement, Hattori suggested the two have a Pokémon battle to determine which A-class Pokémon Sommelier would get to choose the Pokémon for Momotchi. The battle was a 1-on-1 affair and Pinot Noir`s Purrloin was sent out to face Cilan`s Crustle. Pinot Noir said his Choroneko`s speed and power even surpasses its evolved form Lepardas. During the battle, Pinot Noir noted that Cilan`s Crustle was a good choice for Cilan in that it`s faithful to the basics but that alone was nothing but an ordinary and boring tasting. He expanded by saying that selecting Iwapalace, who is both a Rock and a Bug type, against Choroneko, a Dark type, is a standard reaction. He suggested to Cilan that an A-class Sommelier needed to have more unpredictability which Cilan`s Crustle showed by coming out of its shell and using Rock Wrecker to defeat Pinot Noir`s Purrloin. Pinot Noir admitted that Cilan`s Crustle hid an unexpected flavor.
When Cilan chose Tamagetake as Momotchi partner, he initially thought that fashion-wise, they weren`t really a match but after he saw the bond between the two he admitted that he lost the tasting compatibility to Cilan but vowed to beat him the next time they met.</description>

He told them all about the different moss and where they rocks and stones they use came from. He unfortunately had to tell Georgia that they hadn`t discovered moss effective on Ice types yet but he told her that he would inform her as soon as they did.
When the moss started to overrun the laboratory, Clay told everyone to take refuge in the control room down in the basement. He then informed Officer Jenny (Isshu) about the situation and was concerned about Iris on the roof.</description>

Professor Marble was initally away on an academic meeting when Ash and his friends as well as Georgia were taken on a tour of the facility by Clay. When he arrived back at the laboratory, he noticed something was very wrong and quickly ran inside to see what was going on.
He was able to quickly diagnose the problem as he realized that the Tesseed that absorbed the power of the Electric Stones were the ones creating the outbreak of moss. He then concocted a medicine from the extractions of Lum Berries and Mago Berries blended with White Herbs which he told Nurse Joy (Isshu) how to make and treated Pikachu with. He then figured out how to stop the Tesseed from continuing to create moss by putting them under containment and letting them discharge the electricity. The plan was a success and he apologized to his Tesseed for making them suffer and to everyone else for all the trouble.</description>
