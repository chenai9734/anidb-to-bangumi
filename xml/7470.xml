<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>elements</name>
<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>shoujo ai</name>
<description>Shoujo Ai means girls love, and thus explores what happens when two girls (or women) fall in love. This is not to be mistaken for http://anidb.net/t2695 [Yuri] which is (or, at least, how this term is often used by the western audience) used in adult works. This is not; that means there is no graphic sex.
The male version is http://anidb.net/t2783 [Shounen Ai].
http://anidb.net/t7146 [Cute girls doing cute things (CGDCT)] is often mistaken as low level Yuri or Shoujo Ai. If there is no Yuri or Shoujo Ai subtext, i.e. if there is no romantic subtext, only tag CGDCT. Please note: CGDCT and yuri/shoujo ai are not mutually exclusive; it is possible to have an anime tagged both.</description>

<description>Music anime generally revolves around people concerned with music in their everyday lives. In addition they often adhere to certain genre conventions, the emphasis on training and practice in preparation for competitions, characters desire for self improvement, and pursuit of a specific goal. This is not unlike the Sports category.</description>

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<description>A show with a predominantly female cast has mostly females as main and secondary cast members while few if any male characters have major roles. This also applies when a male lead is surrounded by females of lesser individual plot relevance, such as in a harem setting.</description>

<name>musical episode</name>
<description>Everything is going the usual way, until, somebody suddenly bursts out singing and instead of giving him a stare others follow his example. Soon the whole cast, random bystanders, just about everybody, is seen singing. Not only singing but also dancing, carrying out choreography professionals need weeks to train, like it`s the easiest thing to do. And here we are, trapped in a musical episode/scene. 
Sometimes there is a (valid) excuse for this behaviour, most often not. A common occurrence in Disney films and so called Bollywood Cinema.</description>

<name>Ryuubi Gentoku</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Introduced in Shin Koihime Musou. A descendant of a distinguished family who was given possession of a sword, the family heirloom, before she encountered the man who would eventually steal her name (leading everyone to believe him to be Ryuubi Gentoku in the first season) and her sword, causing her to fall into disgrace. To redeem herself, she ventures out in search for the man and her sword, which leads her to Kan`u and company, who are greatly surprised of her identity (in fact she is nearly assaulted by Kouchuu, and later Bachou, upon hearing of hearing of the name Ryuubi again). After being attacked twice by bandits (and almost being raped in the second attack) while venturing alone, she concedes to Chouun`s suggestion of joining their group for protection. She is revealed to be an old classmate of Kousonsan in primary school, even though she doesn`t remember Kousonsan`s real name Pairen much to the latter`s disgust.
She eventually gets her sword returned to her from Enjitsu, thanks to Shokatsuryou who conned Enjitsu with a "mysterious container", in the same fashion Enjitsu herself obtained the sword from Enshou. Sadly, she loses her sword again in an effort to help defend a village from an army of attacking bandits. However, she realize her bravery to sacrifice her sword to defend the village after a lecture from Kan`u so she decides to follow her example by making a vow of sisterhood as her younger sister but Chouhi was against it as Chouhi was already her younger sister so instead she becomes Kan`u older sister. By the third season, she, Kan`u and Chouhi have accepted calling each other sisters. Also to her surprise, she is given a new sword, claimed by the Touka villagers to be a "sword left by the gods".</description>

<name>Chouun Shiryuu</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Chouun is a mysterious girl who appears calm, collected, and very powerful. She is the second person to join the group. She loves to tease Kan`u and other women frequently. She also assumes the identity of a hero of justice named Butterfly Mask, hence wearing a Butterfly mask.
In Shin Koihime Musou, Chouun (in Kachou Kamen`s form), saves Ryuubi from bandits with her secret technique, making Ryuubi develop a crush on Kachou Kamen. Chouun asked Ryuubi who saved her, and she `innocently` said good things about her (Kachou Kamen is super cool, and noble), raising Chouun`s mood high. Chouun is also scary when she`s smiling (Sui will have nightmares about it and Shion won`t let her daughter sees Chouun`s smiling face). Chouun even continues teasing Kan`u in more ridiculous ways (like an embarrasing introduction of Kan`u to the bandits who attacked Ryuubi - and Chouun gets a lump on the head as a result).
In Koihime Musou`s OVA, Chouun (as Kachou Kamen) appeared and swam, but Kouchuu, who acted as the school`s doctor, said that its okay, since Kachou kamen`s appearance looks like Chouun, and she imediately tied up and put into an unused class, until night and no one seems to notice her missing (even her daughter, who asked about her whereabouts before).</description>

<name>Kan`u Unchou</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kan`u is known as the Beautiful Black-haired bandit fighter and wields the Green Dragon Crescent Blade. She is also one of the main characters beside Chouhi. Her past reveals that her family was killed by bandits, which made it her quest to ensure Innocent people will never suffer like she did. She cares a lot for her friends, and she is a sister to Chouhi after they swore a vow of sisterhood because she felt sorry for Chouhi`s loneliness. Two common recurring jokes about her are: 1) people who have heard the legend of the Black-haired bandit fighter remark that the rumors describe her as the a most beautiful woman, and because of this did not think Kan`u was her and 2) some of the female characters mistakenly believe she and Rinrin are mother and daughter despite the fact she is still young. The second running gag is carried even further in Shin Koihime Musou when Kousonsan mistakes Koumei as Kan`u`s daughter as well.</description>
