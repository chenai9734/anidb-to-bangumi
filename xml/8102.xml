<recommendations total="4">
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="82150">I highly recommend this anime for true Type-Moon fans. DON`T expect something like FMP! Fumoffu?!. Those are who are targeted with this (and most likely will get all the jokes) are the ones who are immersed in the Tsukihime/Kagetsu Tohya/Melty Blood &amp; FSN/FHA Nasuverse, the visual novels and/or manga. If you came here after watching the god awful Shingetsutan Tsukihime, this isn`t for you as that show (although being in the directly related anime) is NOT canon. You won`t get this show. 
FSN anime fans should find this amusing (if this kind of humour is their cup of tea) but probably won`t get/like the crossover and references to the Tsukihime franchise: if you came looking for more Fate, forget it.
To sum it up, this is an anime OVA intended to celebrate Type-Moon`s 10th Anniversary, thus it is an anime with it`s true fans (from both franchises) in mind, their way of pleasing us for the long drought of new content and a damn fine one at that.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="422068">Mind-blowing experience for fans of Type-Moon AND crazy comedy! But unfortunately it will not be funny if you`re unfamiliar with related series.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="445819">Marking it for fans as if you haven`t seen any of the series involved with this it won`t be near as funny(personally have seen F/SN and Tsukimihime).  I enjoy the F/SN eps the best but I found all the others to be funny as well and I`m sure it would be even better if I knew all the characters/shows.  

Even if you`ve only seen F/SN watch it, it`s hilarious! And the parts dealing with the other shows were still awesome to me.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on http://anidb.net/cr3545 [Takenashi Eri]`s Take Moon manga.
A collection of comical stories involving characters from the http://anidb.net/a3348 [Fate/Stay Night] and http://anidb.net/a1015 [Tsukihime] adult visual novels and their related works. Funny and absurd situations happen to the various characters from both franchises, who react in ways that generally exaggerate or ridicule some of their characteristics.
— written by Hinoe
Note: Made in commemoration of http://anidb.net/cr927 [Type-Moon]`s 10th anniversary. The jokes in this show are about far more material than what is covered by the anime adaptations of the two franchises. Extra-anime knowledge about the so-called Nasuverse is advised for a more complete experience.</description>

<name>otaku</name>
<description>Otaku, derived from a Japanese term for another`s house or family (お宅, otaku), appeared in the 1980s. In the anime http://anidb.net/a77 [Macross], first aired in 1982, the term was used by http://anidb.net/ch7418 [Lynn Minmay] as an honorific term.
In modern Japanese slang, the term otaku refers to a fan of any particular theme, topic, or hobby. Common uses are anime otaku (a fan of anime), cosplay otaku and manga otaku (a fan of Japanese comic books), pasokon otaku (personal computer geeks), geemu otaku (playing video games), and wota (pronounced ota, previously referred to as idol otaku) that are extreme fans of http://anidb.net/t2438 [idols], heavily promoted singing girls. There are also tetsudou otaku or denshamania (railfans) or gunji otaku (military geeks).
While these are the most common uses, the word can be applied to anything (music otaku, martial arts otaku, cooking otaku, etc).
Some of Japan`s otaku use the term to describe themselves and their friends semi-humorously, accepting their position as fans, and some even use the term proudly, attempting to reclaim it from its negative connotations. In general colloquial usage however, most Japanese would consider it undesirable to be described in a serious fashion as otaku; many even consider it to be a genuine insult.
The negativity which modern society shows towards otaku and otaku culture is historically partly attributed to Miyazaki Tsutomu, who became known as The Otaku Murderer in 1989. His bizarre murders fueled a moral panic against otaku. However, the public appearance of most otaku is the major reason for them to be shunned by society today.</description>

<name>horny nosebleed</name>
<description>In Japanese media, healthy young men who have no other sexual outlet will often suffer nosebleeds upon seeing the naked female body, or even just a pair of well-filled panties.
The nosebleed is, of course, a visual shorthand/euphemism for sexual arousal. It is commonly interpreted that way for males and females, with little trickles of blood indicating mild arousal, and gushing fountains of blood indicating erection/extreme arousal in both sexes. It can also be interpreted as shorthand strictly for erections in males. In that case, when blood shoots from the nose explosively, and in ridiculous quantity, the implication would be an ejaculation.

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>absurdist humour</name>
<description>Surreal humour, also known as absurdist humour, is a form of humour predicated on deliberate violations of causal reasoning, producing events and behaviours that are obviously illogical. Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, non-sequiturs, irrational or absurd situations, and expressions of nonsense.
The humour arises from a subversion of audience`s expectations, so that amusement is founded on unpredictability, separate from a logical analysis of the situation. Its appeal stems from the fact that the situation described is exceedingly ridiculous or unlikely.
On an analytical level, all jokes contain a certain amount of incongruity, but while regular jokes carry an incongruity that the audience accepts as compatible with expectations, absurd jokes are characterized by a disproportionate amount of it, with the punch line delivering a situation incompatible with the world as we know it and failing to resolve the matter in the audience`s eyes.

<name>medium awareness</name>
<description>Medium awareness is the situational and generally temporary awareness characters in works of fiction have and display of the very fact that they are characters in works of fiction. For example, they may comment about the background music, quip about the script or narration, complain about the roles given to them by the writer or their lack of screen time, see the subtitles that appear on screen, inform the audience about the arrival of the commercial break, and even use medium effects as tools. The most common form of medium awareness is known as breaking the fourth wall, in which characters speak directly to the audience, either to it as a whole or to specific members of it. The "fourth wall" is the imaginary "wall" at the front of the stage of a proscenium theatre through which the audience sees the play; it is a metaphor for the boundary between what happens inside the work, to the characters, and outside it, to the audience.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>erotic game</name>
<description>An erotic game (eroge) is a Japanese video or computer game that features erotic content, usually in the form of anime-style artwork. In English, eroge are often called hentai games in keeping with the English slang definition of hentai. This is sometimes shortened to H games. In Japan, eroge are also referred to as 18+ games. Most erotic games are visual novels or dating sims but are not limited to them.
Any anime adaptation of a game that contains (or had a version that contains) adult content (generally sex scenes), regardless of how some fanboys blabber on how "the story in that visual novel was too good to be labelled as porn!", should definitely get this category added under them. This should make it pretty clear as to what is an erotic game and what is not.</description>

<name>visual novel</name>
<description>The two terms are similar yet different, however, the fact that they look and `feel` the same outweighs the technical differences. For clarification, visual novels are considered a sub-genre of adventure games and the term does not cover simulations. While the two genres often share a common visual presentation, dating sims are sometimes considered to be more statistically based than the "choose your own adventure" style of visual novels; basically, the choices you make might change something else than just the story arc (or your next porn pic). Dating sims can involve several technical elements such as a time limit, several statistics such as looks and charm which can be boosted through exercise, or an "attraction meter" which can increase or decrease depending on one`s decisions.</description>

<description>Boobs in your face: the character`s face is pressed into a female`s cleavage. This may be accidental or actually intended by the female character, or even a result of a device by the other character. This action is generally seen as sexually charged by the viewers and often also by the cast, so it will usually happen in an ecchi context; as such, something such as a mother hugging her child won`t generally count.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>anthropomorphism</name>
<description>Anthropomorphism is the attribution of uniquely human characteristics to non-human beings, inanimate objects, or natural or supernatural phenomena. If it`s an animal or an object (AI excluded) and it speaks and/or does other human-like things (dresses up) then we`re dealing with anthropomorphism.
Anthropomorphism leans more on the animal-looking side when compared to http://anidb.net/t7 [juujin], which leans more on the human-looking side.</description>

<description>Sometimes normal just doesn`t cut it. Eating: you put food in your mouth and chew. Playing sports: you throw a ball around. You need to make it awesome, no matter how mundane it is.
Let`s throw in some gripping orchestral music, lighting changes, different camera angles, something! Don`t write like a man, write like an evil overlord! Exaggerate your expressions and gestures, speak with excessive intonation, and if all else fails, throw in some close-ups, slow motion, and ominous Latin chanting! With practice, even you can turn something like eating chips into an epic battle of light and dark, blinding the viewer with sheer awesomeness.

<name>serious business</name>
<description>For some people it is just a card- or board game. For others it is not just a matter of life and death — it is much more important than that.
Serious business basically describes a situation, when a show revolves around an activity where a sizeable portion of the in-series population takes it far more seriously than it should. If something`s popularity rivals that of Elvis, or if there are mainstream schools devoted to it instead of teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic; it is serious business.</description>

<name>just as planned</name>
<description>A term usually used to describe a situation, where a seemingly smart and cunning villain sets up a plan that seems grand and impressive, but is actually long winding, ridiculous, and convoluted. And all of that just to trick his opponent(s), like the hero or anybody else, into doing things exactly as he planned. Suffice to say that the villain could have reached his goal by much shorter and easier means, it just wouldn`t seem as awesome anymore.
The phrase is also known as the original Japanese "keikaku doori" where keikaku stands translated for "plan" or "schedule", and doori for "in accordance with ..." or "following ...".
The phrase is a reference to http://anidb.net/ch301 [Yagami Light] from http://anidb.net/a4563 [Death Note], and his love for plans.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Saber, an agile and powerful warrior. Known as the King of Knights, she maintains a high code of honour. Saber is loyal, independent, and reserved; she appears cold, but is actually suppressing her emotions to focus on her goals. Her class is considered the "Most Outstanding", with excellent ratings in all categories.
In Fate/Zero, though she and Emiya Kiritsugu are Servant and Master seeking the same ultimate goal of peace, their differing ideological perspectives result in a strained relationship where Kiritsugu does not directly acknowledge Saber. After Kiritsugu summoned Saber, he made Irisviel hide Avalon - which had served as a catalyst to the summoning - inside her body so to serve as insurance while she performed her act of fake Master. Irisviel`s and Saber`s role at the time was to openly take action and serve as a decoy in order to lure out enemies, while Kiritsugu worked in the shadows with his assistant, Hisau Maiya. Because Saber could not dematerialise her spiritual body, she disguised herself as a man while staying at Irisviel`s side.
In the Fate route, because her master Emiya Shirou cannot effectively provide her with Mana, she minimises her activity to preserve what she has. Saber is bewildered by Shirou`s "protective" tendencies, and believes his erratic and reckless behaviour jeopardise her chances of winning the Holy Grail War.</description>

<description>Toosaka Rin is a model student and idol of Shirou`s school, Rin is secretly a sorceress and Master in the Holy Grail War. She is descended from a long line of sorcerers, and though lacking a formal magic education, is extremely powerful in her own right. Her father was killed in the 4th Holy Grail War, and she has trained since his death to succeed him. She is perceptive, resourceful and avidly competitive. Although she tried to summon a Saber-class Servant, she accidentally called Archer instead.
Rin excels in transformation of energy, which includes storage of Mana in objects. She stores all of her mana in jewels that she charges daily to bypass her body`s natural limitations on releasing energy. She can detonate her jewels on contact with an object, resulting in a release of energy equivalent to an attack rank of "A". Her most common offensive spell is "Gandr", which fires concentrated mana in the form of a black orb from her finger. On contact, the spell amplifies physical conditions -- a person who is already sick, for example, becomes far sicker upon being hit. Rin is also proficient with reinforcement sorcery, which she uses on her legs to give herself more speed.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Aozaki Touko is a very powerful magus who specializes in puppet making and runs a business called Garan no Dou, literally meaning Hall of Monastery. The business is de jure a design agency that sells its work (mostly architectural work) to whoever is interested, but the agency`s good taste is debatable and http://anidb.net/ch1889 [Kokutou Mikiya] believes that Touko is simply forcing what she wants to make onto the customers. As the design company officially only consists of herself and Mikiya, she is the sole designer while Mikiya takes the job of her secretary. However, the design work is partly a cover to its de facto job, which is something more akin to a detective agency for supernatural cases. For those jobs, Mikiya isn`t really a secretary, but an actual investigator, and Touko hired him for his ability as one, seeing he managed to trace her to Garan no Dou even though it`s surrounded by bounded fields and nearly impossible to find. Garan no Dou`s job is so good even the Mage`s Association hires it through Touko`s connection, despite the fact Touko is actually on the run from them. She is on the run because the Mage`s Association has placed a Sealing Designation on her, which means that her skill and knowledge about a unique subject, which can`t be acquired through study (in her case, puppet making), are too strong and useful to be allowed to be lost; due to various reasons, the Designation effectively means doom for a magus. Indeed, she is so skilled that even before the Designation was placed she had already been dubbed Orange; receiving a color is one of the highest recognitions of skill in the Association. She is the sister of Tsukihime`s http://anidb.net/ch1945 [Aozaki Aoko], with whom she does not share a particularly good relationship, for reasons such as Aoko having inherited family head status and having been dubbed Blue, a more powerful color which Touko wanted, and Touko using her name to get money from the Association. She also has a role in the Heaven`s Feel route of the Fate/Stay Night game, in which
she appears as the unnamed maker of http://anidb.net/ch1904 [Emiya Shirou]`s new body, which is actually a puppet, in the True End`s epilogue, after his original body was destroyed.</description>

Though skilled with ranged weapons, he can hold his own in melee combat. Archer considers Shirou Emiya`s idealism to be weak and delusional, recognising Shirou`s mentality of "wanting to save everyone" as naïve and impossible.
Archer is actually an older version of Emiya Shirou, who actually became a heroic spirit in his own right in the future. Embittered and betrayed by his ideals, he participates in the Holy Grail War in an opportunity to kill his past self and in the ensuing paradox free himself from the path which led to his betrayal.</description>

<description>Through an agreement between the Mages` Association and the Church, the Holy Grail Wars are moderated by a priest.

Since the death of Rin`s father, he has also acted as an indirect caretaker for Rin. Although ranked lower in the Church hierarchy than Ciel (from Tsukihime), Kirei employs many of the same techniques and weapons she does.</description>

After Kiritsugu died, Taiga became Shirou`s guardian and has been living with him for several years. Taiga and Shirou are very close, and she regards him as a younger brother.
Taiga is largely a comic relief character; she is irresponsible, clumsy, and prone to sporadic bouts of extreme lethargy or zest. She lives with Shirou under the pretences of being his caretaker, although she cannot cook and lacks many other domestic skills, relying on Shirou to maintain her welfare. Shirou, however, appreciates Taiga`s company, and is more than happy to care for her. When Shirou is in any need of advice, Taiga can be depended on to be a confidante for his worries.</description>

Her objective in Tsukihime is that of hunting down the heretic vampire Roa, which while being a direct order from the church is also her own vendetta.</description>

In the original game and manga she is shown to have a bright cheerful personality that reacts very strongly to careless actions. In the anime she is depicted differently, as having a very quiet attitude. However, despite her personality before Shiki, she is a very powerful sorceress, one of the five sorceresses left in the world. (Please note that there is a large difference between sorceresses and magicians: sorceresses are capable of "miracles" that even magicians cannot pull off.) Her title as a sorceress is "Miss Blue, Magic Gunner", and is notorious in the supernatural world for her lightning-fast temper and capability to destroy, having the power to wipe out entire cities at will. Her sister Aozaki Touko appears in Kara no Kyoukai, and is the original creator of the glasses.</description>

As the player moves through the story, the player will discover that sometimes, Shiki cannot grasp how he became friends with Arihiko in the first place, since Shiki believes Arihiko has a "weird personality." Yet at one point in the game, when Shiki collapses in class due to his condition, Arihiko is the one who loudly informs the teacher that Shiki is sick and needs to be excused. Arihiko then proceeds to help a physically-weakened Shiki to the medical office, thus demonstrating a personality trait that might, depending on the player`s subjective perception, serve to explain why Shiki continues to be friends with Arihiko despite Arihiko`s sometimes-callous behaviour.</description>

He is not to be confused with http://anidb.net/ch1940 [Toono Shiki] (遠野志貴, formerly Nanaya Shiki), the protagonist of http://anidb.net/a1015 [Tsukihime], who was adopted away from the Nanaya clan. For purposes of distinction, the one who was born Toono Shiki (Roa`s current host) is normally referred to as "SHIKI." Toono SHIKI was good friends with his adoptive brother Shiki.
SHIKI eventually lost to his demonic blood and went berserk, attacking Akiha and nearly killing Shiki when he went to her defense. His father, http://anidb.net/ch56170 [Toono Makihisa], forced him to the brink of death and kept him locked up. Shiki`s wounds nearly killed him, so Akiha gave him half her life to keep him alive, but, not being completely dead himself, SHIKI used the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception (which are not "true" MEoDP and are vastly different from Toono Shiki or http://anidb.net/ch1297 [Ryougi Shiki]`s respective versions of that ability) that he gained from nearly dying to steal half of the borrowed life from Shiki. As a result of these events, a connection was established between Shiki and SHIKI, with each possessing a fourth of a life and Akiha keeping the other half.</description>

<description>A trans-national, self-preservative organisation created by western magi for the purpose of controlling, concealing and developing Magecraft. Founded around the Middle Ages by those who foresaw the decline of Magecraft, they decided that in order to preserve their power Thaumaturgy should drift apart from society and become a secret known only by a necessary minimum number of people.
It has many laboratories and research bodies that seek to advance the progress of Thaumaturgy, as well as institutions that transmit their secrets to the next generation. Although the emphasis lies on the pursuit of knowledge, the Association also seeks to increase its own military strength so it can defend itself against those that might threaten it, such as the Holy Church, other mystic organizations and supernatural forces seeking punish mankind for meddling with areas that should not be touched.
The Mage`s Association is currently headquartered at the Clock Tower in London.</description>

<description>The Holy Church, also referred simply as "the Church", is a worldwide religious organisation, apparently styled after the real Roman Catholic Church. It is a powerful faction in the Nasuverse, with several important characters in the `verse works being its active or former members. On the surface, they coexist rather peacefully with the http://anidb.net/ch1951 [Mage`s Association], but that is only out of necessity, and neither group will waste an opportunity to backstab the other. They sometimes act as arbiters in the Association`s internal disputes; one such example are the Holy Grail Wars. Aside their regular duties as a normal religious group, they have a few special agencies dedicated to supernatural events.
The Assembly of the Eighth Sacrament, the lowest among the Church`s special agencies, is charged with researching, recovering and managing Holy Relics, items considered to have the holy attribute, scattered around the world. Their name comes from the seven Sacraments of the Catholic Church. As the Holy Grail is a Holy Relic, they`re in charge of managing every Holy Grail that appears; as such, in order to watch over the Holy Grail War, the priest stationed at Fuyuki City is always a member of this agency and is the one who acts as the war`s Supervisor.
The Church is also very active and relentless in the pursue and elimination of heretics, beings acting in disagreement with the Holy Scriptures. The members of the Church in that line of work are called Executors, and their specialties include magus hunting, demon killing, and vampire slaying. Among them, the most powerful ones are members of the Burial Agency, a group always composed of eight Executors, one of whom is the leader and another of whom is not an acting member, but a backup. Members of the Burial Agency work alone, and they will act without orders if they deem necessary, even going as far as skewering bishops, which earned them the reputation of the most heretic group inside the Church.
Among the items the Holy Church uses for its purposes, one can find the many types of Keys of Providence, Conceptual Weapons used for purification, and the Holy Scriptures, very powerful Conceptual Weapons used only by a few select Executors. Examples of Keys of Providence are http://anidb.net/ch1916 [Kotomine Kirei]`s most used weapons, the Black Keys, sword-shaped items that can be thrown at an opponent in order to pierce them and that do not have a blade when inside the priest`s frock. An example of a Holy Scripture is the Seventh Holy Scripture, used by http://anidb.net/ch1941 [Ciel], a massive metal weapon which can kill a vampire through physical power alone, shoots Bible pages, has an unicorn horn for a bayonet, and has a http://anidb.net/ch31725 [residing spirit].</description>

His first Noble Phantasm is Via Expugnatio: Distant Trampling Domination, the trampling attack used by the Gordius Wheel, which causes lightning strikes upon movement, inflicting massive damage to whatever is in its path. His second and most powerful Noble Phantasm is Ionioi Hetairoi: Army of the King, which is a Reality Marble, a self-contained miniature world that contains thousands of the most trusted of his soldiers who fought alongside him in life resurrected as temporary Servants, marching upon an endless plain of sand.

<description>Nanako is the spirit inhabiting the Seventh Holy Scripture, http://anidb.net/ch1941 [Ciel`s] most powerful weapon. Originally called only "Seven", even by Ciel, she was named "Nanako" by http://anidb.net/ch1947 [Inui Arihiko].
Since the scripture was created by a soul of a willingly sacrificed young girl merging with a unicorn horn, she has some horse-like properties, like hooves for hands and feet, and a fancy for carrots.</description>

<description>Saber Alter is what becomes of http://anidb.net/ch38 [Saber] after being consumed by evil. This version of Saber appears in the Heaven`s Feel route of the Fate/Stay Night visual novel.
Saber becomes Saber Alter after being consumed and regurgitated by http://anidb.net/ch39799 [Dark Sakura]. In that situation, Saber has a much stronger offensive ability when compared to how she was as http://anidb.net/ch1904 [Emiya Shirou]`s servant, but the evil in her decreases other abilities, like her magical resistance. She doesn`t lose her mind, but her personality is twisted, and her inherent character alignment changes from Lawful Good to Lawful Evil. Her ties with her original objectives and the people she cared for are severed, and her choices spin around Dark Sakura`s goals instead.</description>

<description>Kaleido-Ruby is a magical girl version of http://anidb.net/ch241 [Toosaka Rin]. Rin becomes Kaleido-Ruby when she wields the Kaleidostick, one of the inventions of http://anidb.net/ch40592 [Kischur Zelretch Schweinorg]. The Kaleidostick`s ability is to gather prana and knowledge from "versions" of the wielder in alternate dimensions (parallel universes), effectively giving the "current dimension" version large sources of both, but it comes with a catch: the Kaleidostick is a sentient wand that profoundly dislikes its creator, and it likes to place its wielder into humiliating situations; for Rin, this manifests as dressing her up as a magical girl. The wand works through evocation of the Second True Magic, of which little is known other than the fact it operates with parallel universes, that Zelretch is the living person to best understand it and even he cannot fully grasp it, that not even http://anidb.net/ch1906 [the only known Servant from the future] fully understands it, that a few Nasuverse techniques and some of Zelretch`s inventions use it, and that Rin attempts to learn about it over the course of one of the routes in the http://anidb.net/a3348 [Fate/Stay Night] visual novel and afterwards; the events of the Fate/Hollow Ataraxia visual novel are triggered, among other things, by her spectacular failure at a Second True Magic experiment.</description>

<description>Bazett Fraga McRemitz is a magus sent from the http://anidb.net/ch1951 [Mage`s Association] to fight the 5th Holy Grail War. She was born in Ireland as a descendant of an old family of magi that had detached itself from the Association, but she chose to join the Association regardless. Despite her rare lineage, she was dismissed, and decided to employ her abilities as a hunter of those that had been given a Sealing Designation.
She is mentioned very briefly in the http://anidb.net/a3348 [Fate/Stay Night] visual novel. She was the original Master of http://anidb.net/ch1908 [Lancer], but http://anidb.net/ch1916 [Kotomine Kirei] betrayed her and stole her command spells, fatally injuring her in the process. In Fate/Hollow Ataraxia, she is saved by the servant http://anidb.net/ch40363 [Avenger] and acts as his Master.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kuro Sakura, more often called Dark Sakura, is a version of http://anidb.net/ch1905 [Matou Sakura] after being consumed by evil. Any further details are spoilers to the Heaven`s Feel route of the Fate/Stay Night visual novel and http://anidb.net/a10755 [its anime adaptation].
In Heaven`s Feel, it is revealed that Sakura is not biologically a member of the Matou family; as the Matou no longer had heirs capable of magecraft, http://anidb.net/ch37277 [Matou Zouken] took her for adoption. This is also referred to in http://anidb.net/a8160 [Fate/Zero].
To make Sakura compatible with his family`s magecraft, Zouken implants worms in her. To increase their efficiency, he regularly has her abused in several ways. Along with the worms he implanted in Sakura, he also placed fragments of the Holy Grail from the 4th Holy Grail War in her, in order to turn her into a version of the Holy Grail for his own use. In doing that, he places a link between her and the evils that reside in the Grail.
Throughout the course of the 5th Holy Grail War, Zouken uses Sakura and http://anidb.net/ch37943 [his own Servant] to crush the enemy camps. Sakura absorbs not only several Servants but even innocent people; in the process, she also regurgitates the previously-absorbed http://anidb.net/ch38 [Saber] as http://anidb.net/ch37946 [Saber Alter]. As the story progresses, she quickly falls into despair, and eventually gives in to the evil in her. Upon doing so, she becomes Dark Sakura, a rage-driven version of Sakura that is only interested in bringing the evils in the world to life through the activation of the Holy Grail.</description>

He is one of the few characters who appear in more than one of the stories of the Nasuverse, appearing in http://anidb.net/a1015 [Tsukihime] manga and Prologue in the Plus Period artbook, and the Heaven`s Feel scenario of http://anidb.net/a3348 [Fate/stay night].
He supervised the creation of the Holy Grail War ritual, and was a master to the heads of Makiri, Toosaka and Einzbern families at the time.

He is immensely grateful towards Crimson Moon Brunestud for turning him into a vampire, a feeling that has been, since Crimson Moon`s destruction, directed towards his "successor", http://anidb.net/ch37 [Arcueid Brunestud].
A collector of treasures, he joined the http://anidb.net/ch1952 [Church] in order to have access to holy relics.

<description>Mr. Dawn is the tentative number six of the Burial Agency. He is not an actual fighter, so he is only considered to be the sixth member together with his partner (whose identity isn`t specified, but is hinted to be http://anidb.net/ch31686 [Caren Ortensia]).
He is a pacifist, and lack any fighting prowess, special ability, knowledge of thaumaturgy or even strong faith. He is still considered an irreplaceable exorcist under certain conditions, being the only person to exorcise a full grown demon from a person. He is prophesied to perform tree more such exorcisms in his lifetime.
