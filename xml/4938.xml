<description>In 2007, the Punishment of Sexual Perversions Law came into effect. The city is surrounded by a squadron wearing protective suits and they begin to arrest those who look like perverts. No wonder that Inukami Master http://anidb.net/ch10262 [Keita] and Inukami http://anidb.net/ch10241 [Youko] are wanted for Class A perversions. What will happen to Keita, Youko, http://anidb.net/ch10263 [Kaoru]`s Inukami, and the other lovely perversions?

<name>juujin</name>
<description>Kemono, "beast", is a genre of Japanese art and character design that prominently features anthropomorphic animal characters. It is used widely in visual arts, especially drawing and painting, and can be found in many manga, anime, and video game.
Anthropomorphic animal characters in the kemono genre are frequently called juujin, "therianthrope"; the kanji for juujin are also sometimes pronounced kemonobito, "beast-human". While their design differs from artist to artist, they generally employ animal traits considered cute and endearing; most kemono characters retain a fundamentally human personality, however, seldom behaving as the actual animals from which they have been anthropomorphized, and as such they are typically depicted living as humans do.
Juujin leans more on the human-looking side when compared to http://anidb.net/t2857 [anthropomorphism], which leans more on the animal-looking side.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>absurdist humour</name>
<description>Surreal humour, also known as absurdist humour, is a form of humour predicated on deliberate violations of causal reasoning, producing events and behaviours that are obviously illogical. Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, non-sequiturs, irrational or absurd situations, and expressions of nonsense.
The humour arises from a subversion of audience`s expectations, so that amusement is founded on unpredictability, separate from a logical analysis of the situation. Its appeal stems from the fact that the situation described is exceedingly ridiculous or unlikely.
On an analytical level, all jokes contain a certain amount of incongruity, but while regular jokes carry an incongruity that the audience accepts as compatible with expectations, absurd jokes are characterized by a disproportionate amount of it, with the punch line delivering a situation incompatible with the world as we know it and failing to resolve the matter in the audience`s eyes.

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<name>excessive censoring</name>
<description>There are basically two cases to which this term can be applied to:
1) creative censorship
The TV station airing the anime does its best to remove most ecchi parts from the show, using various and original methods. Usually, an uncensored BD/DVD is released later. Apart from the publisher`s greed - sometimes the censorship is used intentionally to make a scene look more obscene than it actually is.
2) convenient censorship
Another case of it - more often known under the term of "convenient censoring/ship" - is a blatant substitute for mosaic/steam/etc. over nether regions. This applies both to normal shows with occasional nudity as a normal part of human life (or just occasional flash of fanservice), as well as to heavy ecchi / borderline hentai shows where /literally/ everything is a fair (and far more "obscene" no matter how to look at it) game, except that misinterpreted taboo nonsense coming from §175 of JPC.</description>

<description>Youko is the female lead of the series. She has two main abilities. The first is jaen (邪炎, "evil flame"), where she shoots a coiling strand of fire out of her fingertips. There is also dai-jaen (大邪炎, "super evil flame"), which is just a larger, more powerful variation. The second ability is shukichi, an ability which allows her to teleport objects. Although she is generally fearless in the face of evil spirits, she is terrified of normal dogs. Later on in the series, it is revealed that Youko is not an inukami at all, but rather a kitsune (which would explain her fear of dogs; foxes and dogs are natural enemies) and the daughter of the legendary Dai Yoko. During an escape from http://anidb.net/ch10266 [Hake], she met the child http://anidb.net/ch10262 [Keita], who was with her for three days and shared his chocolate cake with her, which became one of her favorite things. Due to this incident, she wanted to become Keita`s inukami to make a contract with him. The manga version of Youko is very child-like, much more mischievous, and has been hinted to be a nine tailed kitsune.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Nadeshiko is an Inukami from the same area as http://anidb.net/ch10241 [Youko], who has contracted with http://anidb.net/ch10262 [Keita]`s cousin, http://anidb.net/ch10263 [Kaoru]. In sharp contrast to all other Inukami on the show, she initially appears to be pacifistic and to regret the vanquishing of spirits and monsters. Her attitude and unwillingness to join in fights lead to her being temporarily expelled by her pack. Hake sends Nadeshiko to work with Keita as an example to Youko, who has commented that Nadeshiko is the only one of Kaoru`s pack of Inukami with any merit, but resents having her near her contractor, especially since Keita is clearly attracted to Nadeshiko. When the pack challenges Youko so Nadeshiko might stay with Keita for good, they lose spectacularly and Nadeshiko ends up saving them, showing she has considerable courage and regaining the pack`s appreciation by placing herself between Youko and the pack alpha, http://anidb.net/ch10252 [Sendan]. She constantly wears maid attire, and it is worth noting that Nadeshiko sees Keita`s positive qualities from the start and may once have considered contracting with him. She and Kaoru seem to share a special bond that causes some jealousy from her pack-mates at times. Nadeshiko`s senses are apparently keener than those of the other Inukami and Youko has said that Nadeshiko has an ability the rest of her pack lacks.
It is later revealed that Nadeshiko is a brutally powerful warrior if roused, the master of a power she calls `the Hammer of Destruction`, which smashes everything in its path. At the beginning of the series, Nadeshiko had `given up her power to Heaven`, due to an incident when she had lost herself in the frenzy of battle and nearly destroyed a human village. For a time, she refused to fight anyone or take a master - until she met Kaoru. Only when Kaoru is killed by Jasei does Nadeshiko reclaim the Hammer, which is powerful enough to overwhelm even Jasei.</description>

<description>Igusa is another member of the pack that serves http://anidb.net/ch10263 [Kaoru]. She has green hair, which she wears in two braids and she wears spectacles. Igusa secretly writes shounen manga under the pseudonym `Ruriko Saffron` and is extremely shy, causing her to be nervous when around http://anidb.net/ch10262 [Keita] when he`s in a perverted mood or when she perceives him to be thus. Despite her fear of perversion in men, she appears to be a closet fan of shounen-ai situations herself - a fact she apparently hides from her fellow pack members.</description>

<description>Tayune is the sporty-looking, short-haired member of the pack that serves http://anidb.net/ch10263 [Kaoru]. Tayune is a physical person, quick to beat http://anidb.net/ch10262 [Keita] when she feels he is being perverted towards her, quite loud and prideful. Oddly, she is apparently also deathly afraid of ghost stories and scary things. In combat, she sometimes wields a short staff as a blunt weapon. She is often teased by her fellow Inukami for being scared, and for supposedly getting romantically attached to Keita. Tayune is brutally powerful in combat, possibly second only to http://anidb.net/ch10253 [Nadeshiko] when the latter is fully empowered among Kaoru`s inukami.</description>

<description>Gokyouya is a gray-haired Inukami who near-constantly wears a white lab coat and may be the oldest of http://anidb.net/ch10263 [Kaoru]`s Inukami. Gokyouya is studying seriously to become a doctor at some point and is close friends with two other of Kaoru`s Inukami, http://anidb.net/ch10258 [Furano] and http://anidb.net/ch10257 [Tensou]. Before she became Kaoru`s inukami, she was linked by contract to Keita`s father, Souta; she still has warm feelings for him, which she has in part transferred to http://anidb.net/ch10262 [Keita]. Gokyouya may be the oldest of Kaoru`s inukami, as she displays greater maturity than many of her pack members.</description>

<description>Tensou is an Inukami in http://anidb.net/ch10263 [Kaoru]`s pack. She wears overalls and has long brown hair that falls down to cover her eyes. Tensou rarely talks, instead opting to draw on her sketch pad a picture of what the person just described. The drawings are done fast and with much detail and accuracy. When Tensou does speak, it is in a low, quiet voice, normally only supplementing what others say. She is perhaps the most reclusive of the Inukami, but is close friends with http://anidb.net/ch10256 [Gokyouya] and http://anidb.net/ch10258 [Furano].</description>

<description>Furano is an Inukami in http://anidb.net/ch10263 [Kaoru]`s pack who wears miko attire and has short yellow hair. She has a limited ability to predict the future, though this seems to be a random chance. Furano is one of the least bashful and shy of the inukami in service to Kaoru, as she showed willingness to strip for http://anidb.net/ch10262 [Keita] so that she could obtain the Number One ranking in Kaoru`s household. She responded positively to http://anidb.net/ch10271 [Karina] having his hand on her breast and is also of age, as she confirmed when she said that she could "Perform a little extra fan service" since she was "An 18+ character". She is closest to http://anidb.net/ch10256 [Gokyouya] and http://anidb.net/ch10257 [Tensou] among her fellow inukami.</description>

<description>Tomohane is the youngest of the pack of Inukami that has contracted with http://anidb.net/ch10263 [Kaoru]. She has the special ability to track the path of otherworldly entities and apparently has some skill with chemistry. As the youngest and weakest member of her pack, Tomohane fears that she will hold her allies back and so she tries very hard to keep up with the rest of the Inukami. After an adventure involving http://anidb.net/ch10262 [Keita] and a minor spirit-creature - a mujina - which she later adopted as a pet and named http://anidb.net/ch10276 [Maro], Tomohane was the second of Kaoru`s Inukami to recognize Keita`s good side.</description>

<name>Kawahira Keita</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kawahira Keita is the male lead of the series. He was considered a failure by his family due to his attitude towards their ancient duty to vanquish evil, treating it like a part time job, and his initial inability to find an inukami to bond with. Even though http://anidb.net/ch10241 [Youko] becomes his inukami and is fully interested in him, he has a bad habit of flirting with other girls; it is later revealed that Keita is mortified by the thought that, if he should develop a relationship with Youko, he might become the father of a litter of puppies, rather than of a human baby. He is frequently punished for his transgressions by Youko, to whom he had to promise that he would be loyal to her, that he would be hers and that he would be her toy, to do with whatever she wanted, before she would contract with him. He wears a dog`s collar as a symbol of this pact — an item he originally intended as his `vow gift` to Youko. Youko has frequently landed him in jail by teleporting him into a public place without his clothes, causing him to be mistaken for a streaker and arrested for indecent exposure. Due to this, he has been named Ra-ou (Naked King) by the city`s perverts (male and female alike). When he is naked, his groin is replaced by a child`s drawing of an elephant.
Keita possesses considerable athletic skills, can make frog-shaped talismans up to around the size of his fist from rubber which he can use to make ranged attacks, and is a practitioner of xingyiquan. Despite his flaws, Keita has considerable redeeming qualities; he is determined, usually fearless, and loyal to his friends and to people under his protection. http://anidb.net/ch10300 [Keita`s grandmother] is the head of the Kawahira family. She has contracted a male inukami named Hake. In the manga Keita, is a chain smoker and is much more serious than his anime counterpart. He also appears to care for Youko a great deal, but has problems taking her seriously because of her impulsive and mischievous behavior.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kawahira Kaoru is http://anidb.net/ch10263 [Keita]`s cousin. Contrary to Keita, Kaoru has a pack of ten Inukami and he is generally well-thought of, being more restrained and respectable of demeanor, although he is no less kind at heart. All Kaoru`s inukami care deeply for him and he seems to return the sentiment, although his connection with http://anidb.net/ch10253 [Nadeshiko] is strongest of all and is probably romantic in nature. Like Keita, Kaoru is quite athletic and a powerful magic-user; his signature move is to command the wind to deliver destructive blasts with the medium of an orchestra conductor`s baton. It is later revealed that Kaoru is under a curse that planted him in a fake body, one that is close to dying. He shared this secret only with Nadeshiko, whom he revealed that he loved. He was raised by an evil magician that feeds off of the despair emitted by the people around him. Kaoru therefore had everything taken from him by the magician. He later sacrifices himself to save Nadeshiko, and it is then that he confesses his love.</description>

The contract item he was given are the decorative beads he wears. Also, there are evidence that his weakness are fleas.</description>

He has stated that he is collecting the "devil`s toys" created by an ancient wizard named Sekidousai. He has more than once gotten Keita off the hook when the latter is once again arrested for indecent exposure after angering Youko. Karina wields an enchanted weapon he calls Angel Blade in combat. One of its signature attacks is the Holy Crush. It is later revealed that Sekidousai is his ancestor; the two men look very much alike, except for their different hair colors. Their characters are very different as well; whereas Karina is a morally upstanding person, Sekidousai is a pervert. However, it is later hinted at that, subconsciously, Karina may be a pervert, although definitely not to the same extent as his ancestor. He is frequently shown in a variety of fetishes, some granted by misinterpreted wishes and others the products of his subconscious desires.</description>

He has considerable skill in the art of invisibility, as he can sneak past most of Kaoru`s inukami, and was able to get close enough to Sekidousai to steal his book, dodge his attacks and escape. The Peeping Doctor claims that he never returns to any place where he has been spotted and affects gentlemanly airs despite his unpleasant hobby. He apparently forms a team with http://anidb.net/ch10284 [Oyakata] and the http://anidb.net/ch10285 [Kakarichou].</description>

The Boss has on several occasions annoyed http://anidb.net/ch10263 [Kaoru]`s Inukami by (attempting to) steal their lingerie, but he has also been instrumental in the battle to destroy the robot Xanthippe. Whenever he is seen, the Boss wears trousers, boots and lingerie; generally a pair of panties on his head and a bra on his chest.

The main physical difference between him and any other salaryman is that he constantly goes about tied up in bondage ropes. Another glaring difference is that most businessmen do not, generally speaking, go about begging to be punished; the Chief Clerk is a fervent masochist who constantly begs people to scold and/or punish him and managed to anger http://anidb.net/ch10241 [Youko] greatly by asking her to break him to her will. In combat, the Chief Clerk`s masochistic tendencies sometimes come in use, as even Jasei`s skeletal troops seemed to be taken aback by his aggressive solicitation of punishment.</description>
