<description>* Based on a light novel series written by http://anidb.net/cr20128 [Kimura Shin`ichi] and illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr23348 [Kobuichi] and http://anidb.net/cr27824 [Muririn].
After the epic last battle, looking back on a day at a huge indoor pool complex http://anidb.net/ch21624 [Aikawa Ayumu], http://anidb.net/ch25396 [Orito], even http://anidb.net/ch25399 [Shimomura] and most of the girls — necromancer girl http://anidb.net/ch21625 [Eu], http://anidb.net/ch21623 [Haruna], http://anidb.net/ch21621 [Seraphim], http://anidb.net/ch25398 [Kanami], http://anidb.net/ch25397 [Taeko], and http://anidb.net/ch21622 [Mael Strom] — take a well deserved day off.
But Haruna is determined to find Nessie (the Loch Ness Monster) in one of the many pools, and Eu confirms this to be an exciting urban legend. It could all be such a peaceful day for Ayumu, were there not so many female distractions.

<name>swimsuit</name>
<description>A swimsuit is one of several kinds of garments designed to be worn by people engaging in water-based activities or sports or during certain activities under sunlight. Most kinds of swimsuit reveal a large portion of the body surface area, but exceptions exist. The more revealing kinds may also be worn as undergarment in sports that require wetsuits, or when there is a need to display the body, as in the case of beauty pageants or bodybuilding contests.
There is a very wide range of styles of modern swimsuits, which vary in relation to body coverage and materials. The choice of style of swimsuit is dependent on current fashions, community standards of modesty, and plain personal preference. Swimsuits for men usually expose the chest, while those for women do not usually do so; however, many women prefer to engage in water or sun activities with their torso uncovered, in a practice commonly described as toplessness or topfreedom. Since the early twentieth century a naturist movement has developed in western countries that seeks a return to non-sexual nakedness when swimming and during other appropriate activities; in some places around the world, nude beaches have been set aside for people who choose to engage in normal beach activities in the nude, and such beaches may or may not enforce nudity onto their goers.
In anime, it is common for at least one episode to feature the characters in swimsuits, usually as an excuse for gratuitous fanservice; when that happens, the episode is usually labeled a pool or beach episode, after the place the characters went to. Swimsuits, and in particular one-piece swimsuits, are a very common fetish in Japan; while the reason for that is uncertain, a common folk explanation is the fact that boys throughout their entire adolescence are commonly exposed to their female classmates wearing them, in what might be called an experiment in sexual discovery waiting to happen.</description>

<name>novel</name>
<description>A novel is a relatively long work of narrative fiction, normally written in prose form, and which is typically published as a book. Manga, comics, or visual novels do not fit this description and are not considered novels; including a small number of illustrations, however, is still permissible, which means that light novels are considered novels.</description>

<name>pool episode</name>
<description>An episode playing at the pool, mostly in school, sometimes outside of it when the cast does not have a chance for a beach episode.
Usually used for fanservice purpose as it gives the staff the opportunity to draw the characters in swimsuits and raise the DVD sales.
The cheap version of the http://anidb.net/t5846 [beach episode].
Other variants are the http://anidb.net/t3444 [onsen episode] and the http://anidb.net/t2830 [furo scene], used when it is too cold for a beach/pool episode.

<description>Eucliwood, called `Eu` for short, is a necromancer who brought Ayumu back to life to be her guard and has been living with him since. She doesn`t talk, instead communicating through written notes, mostly pertaining to her appetite. It is shown that she does care about Ayumu even though she considers him to be her servant. She does not like people talking about death or telling them to go die. Ayumu often daydreams about her speaking in a cutesy manner (voiced by a different voice actor in each episode of the anime).</description>
