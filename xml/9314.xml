<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="446567">I went into watching this with high hopes...but by the end I was left somewhat wanting. Suffice to say I certainly enjoyed other previous DBZ movies to this one, so it ain`t the worst apple in the bunch. Dragon Ball Z: Kami to Kami/Battle of Gods serves more as a large ensemble of many DB and DBZ characters (excluding filler chars) past and present, hearkening back to its roots in manga rather than anything else, which is something I really liked, especially the exchanges between DB chars and DBZ newcommers. In other respects, it ticks all the boxes of a DBZ instalment; high octane fighting, during the rare chance it actually comes up (lotsa dialogue), humour, bravery, emotion, etc etc. I wasn`t impressed with the heavy use of 3D CGI during certain scenes, however, as I missed the classic DBZ movies and the way the backgrounds were illustrated and static, and less false looking. In conclusion, I would say that this movie is purely for the fans.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="346264">CGI made it less Dragon Ball Z like, not the best of movies, a bit dissapointing , still a dragon ball z movie is a dragon ball z movie. Fans would enjoy nevertheless.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="432184">Great show i gotta say. The plot should be taken with a grain of salt. What i liked most is that we had some cute little additions that pointed to the roots, the original dragon ball, with goku as a child. Pilaf and his crew ofc is a prime example and chibi Mei + trunks was just so cute xD. Also the dinosaur that appeared for a split second. It all connected well to other important things like Videl`s pregnancy or Vegeta`s brother and father. All in all a great watch that should not be taken too srsly which might just bring a small tear of nostalgy into your eye.</recommendation>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Gohan is introduced as the first son of the primary protagonist, Son Goku, and his wife, Chi Chi, in volume #17 of the original manga, or the premiere episode of its animated adaptation, Dragon Ball Z. Gohan is the first Saiyan/Human hybrid in the series.
As opposed to full-blooded Saiyans, whose hair stays the same from birth, Gohan`s is drawn at varying lengths, and changes markedly in style. Many of Yamcha`s hairstyles are used by Gohan at various points in his life.
Initially, Gohan is illustrated garbed in a Hanfu-like surcoat with the Chinese character 孫, fixed on the front and the four-star Dragon Ball fitted on top of his hat. Piccolo later supplies him with a keikogi fashioned after Goku`s, but substitutes it with the demon character "魔" as a sign of his admission into the Demon Tribe. Normally thereafter, Gohan is drawn with a keikogi modeled after Piccolo`s own, with the anime recoloring his wristbands from blue to red and, during the Cell Games tournament, his obi from red to blue, despite reverting to the original colors for the former. On Namek, Gohan is portrayed in battle armor worn by Frieza`s henchmen, having been given it by Vegeta in preparation for their encounter with Frieza. Prior to his second fight with Majin Buu, Gohan asks Kibito for an outfit resembling his father`s, and is then drawn in a keikogi identical to Goku`s.</description>

<description>Despite his threatening sounding name, Ox-King is really quite harmless and fun loving. He was somewhat demonic when his castle became engulfed in flames on Fire Mountain during a picnic with his daughter, and wreaked havoc through the village at the foot of the mountain. He is Chichi`s biological father and thus, Gokuu`s father-in-law. He is very strong and trained alongside Grandpa Gohan under Kame Sennin`s tutelage.</description>

<name>Mr. Satan</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Mr. Satan (known as Hercule in the English adaptations) is a flamboyant martial artist. After http://anidb.net/ch2103 [Gokuu] and his companions stop attending the Tenkaichi Budoukai, Mr. Satan starts winning them and becomes the reigning champion for many years.
On a Q&amp;A with mangaka http://anidb.net/cr1902 [Toriyama Akira] published in Super Exciting Guide - Character Volume on April 3, 2009, it is revealed that Mr. Satan is just a stage/ring name and that his actual first name is "Mark". While it seems like a common name, it is actually written out in katakana as マーク (maaku). If you rearrange the syllables, as you would with many names in the series to derive their puns, you end up with akuma (meaning "devil" or "demon"), which is in concordance with his daughter`s name being a pun on the English word "devil".
During the Cell Games, he attempts to fight http://anidb.net/ch24822 [Cell], but even after being swatted away, he is given credit for Cell`s death by the media. He is soon called a world hero, gaining great wealth and a city named after him. Though Gokuu and his companions find his inflated ego and arrogance very annoying, he becomes close to them after befriending the good http://anidb.net/ch41758 [Majin Buu] and by helping defeat Kid Buu by using his appeal to the people of Earth to get energy for the Genki Dama. His daughter, http://anidb.net/ch12209 [Videl], marries http://anidb.net/ch9915 [Gohan].</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Jinzouningen 18 Gou (Android #18 in the English adaptations) is a fictional character who first appears in the Dragon Ball manga created by http://anidb.net/cr1902 [Toriyama Akira], followed by the shows http://anidb.net/a1530 [Dragon Ball Z] and http://anidb.net/a233 [Dragon Ball GT]. She is a mass murderer in http://anidb.net/ch13302 [Future Trunks]` timeline.
Originally a human, she and her brother were modified into cyborgs by http://anidb.net/ch18381 [Dr. Gero].
On a Q&amp;A with mangaka http://anidb.net/cr1902 [Toriyama Akira] published May 2nd, 2014 it was revealed that her human name was Lazuli.
After http://anidb.net/ch20915 [Cell] is defeated, http://anidb.net/ch11414 [Kuririn] uses the Dragon Balls to wish for her and her brother to be turned into humans; http://anidb.net/ch7015 [Shenron] is unable to perform this task because of the unfathomable differences in power between him and the duo, so he wishes instead for their self destruct devices to be removed. Kuririn pursues her and, at some point, they marry and have a daughter named http://anidb.net/ch30874 [Marron].
To clear up the heavily espoused misconception that she is a pure android and therefore could not have a child, Kuririn went on to explain to http://anidb.net/ch2103 [Son Gokuu] during the Tenkaichi Budoukai Saga that she was originally human but that Dr. Gero just "remodeled her a little bit."</description>

<name>Beerus</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Beerus is the God of Destruction, an individual that`s been around for centuries having destroyed several planets, solar systems and races. Even the mighty saiyajin king Vegeta once bowed in terror infront of him. Beerus even sees Freezer as little more than a nuisance that was too far away to deal with.
Beerus spends most of his time either sleeping for decades at a time or traveling around the universe destroying planets, eating whatever people offer him or in general doing whatever he feels like doing.
Beerus might have a short temperament and with his title God of Destruction may sound quite evil but despite all this, he is not a bad guy in general but rather more of in the gray area, always honoring his words and not doing things unnecessarily.
He is currently the second strongest individual in the Dragonball world. http://anidb.net/ch9004 [Super Saiyajin 3 Gokuu] was nothing but a toy for him. Even after http://anidb.net/ch2103 [Gokuu] ascended to Super Saiyajin God and came back with an increased power, he still did not manage to push Beerus to fight at more than 60% of his full power.
Note: As is the case with most of the main cast from Dragonball, Beerus`s name is a pun. In this case, it`s two puns meshed into one. The original pun was on the word `virus` as scriptwriter, Watanabe Yuusuke, stated in an interview with DVD &amp; Blu-ray Magazine that he had written a scenario in which the God of Destruction was actually the one responsible for originally infecting the Saiyajins with evil. However, when Toriyama Akira stepped in and changed a great deal of the movie`s backstory, he thought Beerus`s name was a pun on the English word `beer` and then followed suit by naming http://anidb.net/ch53770 [Whis] (ウイス or uisu) after `whiskey`, another alcoholic beverage.</description>
