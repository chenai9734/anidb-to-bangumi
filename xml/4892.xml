<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="353741">One of my favorite animes! :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="179096">Great till 20ish but then the anime takes a U turn from the mangas plot and falls of a cliff :(</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="195050">Covers only around 10-20% of the manga. Alot has been left out and there is no "true" ending. Quite a let down. But if you enjoyed it, go for the manga aswell.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="540649">This anime is just really great. I wished there could make a season 2. Highly recommended!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="231797">I highly recommend claymore. If there is any single drawback to the series, its that it isn`t long enough. The artwork is very crisp and the storyline continues to grow in depth as the series progress. The maternal bond between the tragic heroine and the rescued human boy can be seen as distracting at first, but is revealed to be essential by the end.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="92088">Very recommended action anime that keeps getting better and better as it progresses.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="32523">I never did like Female heroines but this anime sure did change that</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="180434">very good series!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="311540">Superb in terms of animation, the character design, background detail and excellently choreographed fighting sequences.  However the true strength lies in the overall plot which proves original, complex and gripping - you`ll be on the edge of your seat on many an occasion. I highly recommend this anime for those a fan of action, complex character development, the supernatural and beautiful animation.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="323024">One of the best Fighting Anime ! =)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="84599">Great story, action scenes expressed in extrodinary way..definitely an anime that is a must for every anime fan. Wish they could come up with more of the same kind and as follows more often.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="256650">Very great story line, and you wont be able to stop watching until the end, people who love blood will like it too.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="33917">CLAYMORE, NOT LESS!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="301890">It`s good watch with great story. That is - except last 2-3 episodes, where they go for different ending, that fits Saint Seiya, but not Claymore. Don`t watch those, just switch to manga then, which continues to be interesting.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="151117">Dang what can i say more if you don`t see this it will be your lose!

super anime indeed very good storyline too</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="158874">Great anime, the manga is even better!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="97536">I would`ve put 7,5 if I could. &lt;br /&gt;Beautiful background and absolutely amazing fights. The action is more or less perfect</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="266400">This has definitely become one of my favorite animes. I suggest it to anyone who enjoyed Mai-HiME or similar productions. :D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="614177">Claymore is a great anime, with a good plot, its even better when we discover Clare`s past, and we met Teresa which is the best character of this serie. There is plenty of action, and despite Raiki being such a pain in the ass there is great characters.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="48794">seen, great</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="495619">It`s hard to put words on this anime... But i find it quite deep and action-packed while it is very colourful in many aspects. One of my favourites in the fantasy genre.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="289032">I`d be perfect if we see a second season other otherwise weak ending.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="233032">This could have been an awesome series. Unfortunately an extremely weak and rash ending and a very annoying character (Raki) destroyed this anime. Recommended only for fans of this genre.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="267227">Great Anime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="199638">Very good, but bloody series with amazing plot.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="247435">Pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;Theres no lack of action, Clare is nice and the music is good also.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="511528">Something different from average plot you see these days , for fans only... maybe , .... well if you resist the first episodes you should see it till the end , on the other side the manga is is coming one drop at the time . Imo anime before manga in this case</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="151293">This is a must-watch for all shounen &amp; big swords lovers. Though I don`t like the genre shounen much I loved this anime at first sight. Good storyline, awesome fightings and lot of blood and gore. Just exactly my taste. They missed a lot out of manga and the ending was completely changed (I think it was due to the fact the manga is still ongoing), but even so it is still worth to watch. 10/10 for me</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="538909">I was unsure about this one as I`m usually not a fan of these types of anime. I stuck it out until I saw "Awakening". If your like i was and not sure, Watch up to that episode before you decide. I was hooked at that point.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="135151">Excellent series. Good story and characters.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="66548">A better than average anime but a bit of a disappointment in the end.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="559673">this is a perfect dark fantasy setting, with good plot ,good character development ,rivers of blood , awesome fights and good soundtracks...the only blind spot is the changing of the ending. although i believe it was done coz they didn have plan of making a season 2.After claymore it is a monthly magna and the series could catch on, in no time.For those who liked the tv series i must inform you that it is just the prologue  of claymore and i f you want to learn more , read the manga who has a great story development and it explains everything(about the organization,about how the yoma got born. etc) I am still hoping for season 2 or a remake of claymore, after all the tv series cover about 25% to 30%</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="304934">dark and incredible in every aspect  both the story and soundtrack are amazing however, I was disappointed because the last 4 episode changed a little bit from the original manga but still incredible. I wish if there is a 2ed season 

a must see for dark anime fans</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="260880">spectacular!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="359181">Over all great anime (manga better). Seemingly slow start (ep 1-4) due to back story being withheld from viewers but when the second arc (ep 5-8) are done the anime kicks into high gear and doesn`t stop plus the antagonist of the story changes too. Also note episode 5-8 are arguably the best in the series. Anime is very loyal to manga until the end (manga wasn`t written yet, so good reason why), in short to spot changes if character naked Raki is in it its different from manga but if Clare is there without Raki its the same. The animes end isn`t any where as good the same part in manga (which doesn`t end there) however it`s still better than most anime in general. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most healthiest way of viewing the changes is that the anime did from the manga is that they had to end so they ran with the mangas early theme of absolute power corrupts absolutely.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="269108">I still have hope that someday will come out 2nd season ;)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="226525">One of the best anime titles I`ve seen.. EVER!!  &lt;br /&gt;Non-stop action, interesting characters and a great script are its best qualities. A real Gem</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="107472">very nice short series&lt;br /&gt;best after basilisk</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="243538">the first few episodes or OK, but it gets much better after that</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="604273">Women, swords, demons and a lot of blood! You MUST watch it!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="477383">I dunno why was i delying this show for a so long its freaking awesome... Must see</recommendation>

<description>* Based on the shounen manga by http://anidb.net/cr7420 [Yagi Norihiro], serialised in Monthly Shounen Jump, later in http://anidb.net/cr5372 [Weekly Shounen Jump].
Long ago, Youma, shape changing demons, took human form to live in disguise in human towns, feeding on them in secret.
A secret, nameless society has discovered a way of implanting Youma flesh into humans to create hybrids powerful enough to defeat the Youma. A hybrid`s standard abilities include faster healing, limited shape modification, the ability to detect Youma and other hybrids, and overall enhanced physical prowess allowing them to wield massive claymores, for which they are named: Claymores. For reasons not divulged, only women are selected to be Claymores. They are often chosen for implantation after being the sole survivors of a family attacked by a Youma; this ensures their loyalty and willingness to endure the painful hybridization process.
The society sends Claymores to towns that can afford their fees to kill Youma. The society is often strict and harsh; Claymores who break the rules risk being hunted down by their fellow warriors.
The story of Claymore follows the adventures of the beautiful warrior Claire, who fights demons while struggling to hold on to her own humanity.</description>

<name>reverse trap</name>
<description>A reverse trap is a plot device where a female character is mistaken for a male, with the intention of sexually deceiving other characters and/or the viewer. This behavior does not need to be intentional by the female (it is often not intentional) or continually maintained by the female, but the occurrence is common enough to deserve this fetish-specific tag.
This is often achieved by portraying the female character as a male; primarily via their clothing and physical appearance, but also through her behaviour, and/or language. A female character misinterpreted by others as male, without action from the female (explicitly masculine dress or behaviour), is generally not considered a reverse trap; instead they are likely just http://anidb.net/t2561 [androgynous].
The reverse case is known as a http://anidb.net/t618 [trap].</description>

<name>sword</name>
<description>A sword is a long, edged piece of metal, used as a cutting, thrusting, and clubbing weapon in many civilizations throughout the world. Before firearms became commonplace, and fast enough to render other weapons pointless in the battlefield, they were the main kind of weapon for war and duels alike. A sword fundamentally consists of a blade and a hilt, typically with one or two edges for striking and cutting, and a point for thrusting. That aside, however, they may come in all sorts of designs: the medieval European swords used to be big, heavy weapons that did not actually cut but instead broke the enemy`s bones under their armor; conversely, the Chinese jian sword (called "ken" in Japanese) attempted to exploit the armor`s joints and perforate the enemy`s flesh in those places, but was useless against the armor itself, and did not take the strikes, preferring to redirect them, to this day being considered a highly "circular" weapon and associated to taijiquan; on the other hand, the Japanese katana was a balanced all-purposes weapon that could be used even in an axe-like way, but which a master swordsman could use in many other, more elaborate manners.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<tag id="2606" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2018-11-05">
<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<tag id="2607" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2009-04-29">
<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<tag id="2608" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2012-12-04">
<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<description>Anime that takes place in the past or clearly seems to take place in the past in case of an alternative universe. This category should almost always go together with one of its sub-categories, because the past can either be a depiction of a historical event(s) or not, in which case it would be alternative past.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<description>The conspiracy thriller (or paranoid thriller) is a sub-genre of the thriller which flourished in the 1970s in the US (and was echoed in other parts of the world) in the wake of a number of high-profile scandals and controversies (most notably Vietnam, the assassination of President Kennedy, Chappaquiddick and Watergate), and which exposed what many people regarded as the clandestine machinations and conspiracies beneath the orderly fabric of political life.
The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top".</description>

<name>dystopia</name>
<description>A dystopia (from Ancient Greek: δυσ-, "bad, ill", and Ancient Greek: τόπος, "place, landscape"; alternatively cacotopia, or anti-utopia) is, in literature, an often futuristic society that has degraded into a repressive and controlled state, often under the guise of being utopian. Dystopian literature has underlying cautionary tones, warning society that if we continue to live how we do, this will be the consequence. A dystopia, thus, is regarded as a sort of negative utopia and is often characterized by an authoritarian or totalitarian form of government. Dystopias usually feature different kinds of repressive social control systems, a lack or total absence of individual freedoms and expressions and constant states of warfare or violence. Dystopias often explore the concept of humans abusing technology and how humans individually and collectively cope with technology that has evolved too quickly such as the car, the flamethrower or the microwave. A dystopian society is also often characterized by widespread poverty and brutal political controls such as a large military-like police.</description>

<description>Time in comics is flexible. Each panel shows a single event, which is usually accompanied by a length of dialog, which must take some time to say. This disparity is usually accepted if it isn`t taken to extremes.
But often, characters will exposit when it`s most needed: at the story`s climax, when both the intricacies of the plot and the intensity of action hit their highest.
While the Heroes Outrun the Fireball, Mr. Exposition might explain why the Evil Overlord`s death caused the explosion. The Action Girl can deliver impressive lectures on why the monster`s Achilles` Heel will work, while still engaging in Waif-Fu. The Superhero can quip to his heart`s content and explain his abilities while dueling one insignificant mobster, or deliver a Kirk Summation during the course of a single Finishing Move. Sometimes even apparent mere mortals can give a lecture on what is happening when it would be a much better idea to simply run like hell.
Without stopping to breathe, apparently.

<name>gore</name>
<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<name>Clare</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>When she was a child, a Yoma made her part of its disguise and its toy, often torturing her. The Yoma is killed by Teresa. Empathising with Teresa`s pain, Clare follows her for days without rest, food, or water. Teresa, after at first trying to get rid of Clare, eventually lets her travel with her, and the two became attached. The presence of a caring human in her life helps Teresa regain her lost happiness and humanity. Their life together is cut short when Teresa kills some human bandits to save Clare`s life. The organisation sends four of their best Claymores to execute Teresa, who is eventually killed by the awakened Priscilla.
Clare is ranked #47, the lowest number, among the Claymores.
Clare possesses the flesh and blood of Teresa, which she requested this be her Yoma when she volunteered to become a Claymore. Thus Clare is not a normal Claymore (half-human half-demon) but only 1/4 demon and 3/4 human.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Raki is Clare`s travelling companion. He is introduced as a young boy whose family is murdered by a Yoma, which then takes the form of his older brother, Zaki, as a disguise. This Yoma is slain by Clare, but Raki is suspected of being a Yoma as well, and exiled from his village. Clare only offered to take him with her until he finds a village he wishes to live in, but she gets attached to him. Raki also cares very deeply for Clare, and protects her without hesitation from anyone; even another Claymore.</description>

<name>Teresa</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Teresa was the strongest Claymore of her generation. She was famously known as Teresa of the Faint Smile for effortlessly slaying enemies with a faint smile on her face.
As a Claymore, Teresa is a cold-blooded killer who cares for no one, only helping villages because she is ordered to. She is also solitary and rarely has contact with any of the other Claymores in the organisation (she was surprised when Rosemary sent her a Black Card). She also keeps secrets from her handlers, and severely distrusts the organisation. This changes when Teresa saves a young girl who had been kept as a prisoner and toy of a Yoma. The girl then follows her on her journeys. She is initially extremely irritated by this girl tagging along wherever she goes, but eventually grows fond of her. Teresa gives the girl the name Clare, after the twin goddesses, Teresa and Clare, and is surprised to find out that it was actually Clare`s real name. As they travel together, Clare awakens Teresa`s lost compassion.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Priscilla was promoted to Claymore #2 shortly after she joined the organisation. She was so powerful that she could fight with her Yoma power almost entirely suppressed, allowing her to conceal her presence from Yoma and fellow Claymores even in the heat of battle. According to Irene, this made her a perfect candidate for fighting Teresa, as Teresa`s greatest strength was her ability to sense Yoma energy.</description>

<name>Helen</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Helen is ranked #22. Her special power is to stretch her arms to extreme lengths to attack at range or bind her opponents. Helen is partially Awakened, but has reverted to her human state. She seems to have a large appetite for a Claymore and can often be seen eating an apple. She is also the only Claymore seen eating and drinking for pleasure. Helen is hot tempered and aggressive. Her mouthy and sometimes insensitive nature means that she can appear to be something of a bully. She is Deneve`s constant companion. Deneve commented that she is "always the troublemaker." However, Helen is honest and cares fiercely for her friends.</description>

<description>At the start of the series, Galatea is Claymore Number 3. She is one of the more kind-hearted Claymores. She is a master at sensing Yoki, being able to sense other Claymores from a long distance, read their emotions, and see their actions as if she were close by. She uses this to act as the organization`s "eye". She can also control other people`s actions by subtly manipulating their Yoki flows.</description>

<name>Ophelia</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Ophelia is ranked Claymore #4. Though powerful, she grows increasingly unstable, displaying sadistic and sociopathic tendencies. She murders humans and fellow Claymores to sate her bloodlust, killing any and all who witness her transgressions so that they will not come to light. She also enjoys torturing and played sadistic "games" with her opponents in battle. Ophelia usually talks in a very feminine and polite way, but once something doesn`t work out the way she wants it to or somebody disturbs her "having fun", she changes to a very vulgar, masculine tone. Even though many of her crimes remain undiscovered, or at least unproven, many of the Claymores who have met or worked alongside Ophelia are aware of her monstrous nature.</description>

<charactertype id="3">Organization</charactertype>
<description>They take in humans to become demon (Yoma) killers, popularly named "Claymore" by the humans. To become a claymore meant becoming a half-human half-demon.
In the beginning was there both male and female warriors, but male claymores could not ignore their instinct to release their Yoki as doing so gave them something similar to sexual pleasure. This meant they quickly became an Awakened one. Thus only female claymores are made now.
When a claymore is fully trained she is sent out on a long term mission to kill demons (Yomas) and are usually guided to them by a male member, whom also collects the reward/fee for killing the demons (Yomas) from the towns. This male member provides ever material things a claymore requires during the mission - like clothes and money.
When a claymore releases her/his Yuki (demon/Yoma powers):
At 10% - Eyes change color to golden.
At 30% - Their face distorts.
At 50% - Their body distorts.
At 80% - They the transformation to Yoma begins, and most of the time it can not be stopped. When the transformation completes they be an Awakened one - an enemy, and will regular Yoma desire human guts.
To the public, calling a Yoma a "Voracious Eater" type means it have lived too long, but in fact it means "Awakened Being" (Claymore turned Yoma). An Awakened being is usually very strong so only the most powerful Claymores are used to kill them, which sometimes means a Claymore may end up killing a former friend.</description>
