<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="301225">Considering the main protagonist is actually an adult, I was hoping for a somewhat more adult like presentation and storytelling. But unfortunately that wasn`t the case. This is just the typical highschool life/romance anime series but with a twist.
I also thought this series was a bit predictable at times. If you decide to watch this show then by all means watch the OVA because at least it has a proper ending, unlike the main series. It`s basically a continuation. Still, I`m glad that I watched it and I would recommend it for fans of romance.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="212957">This show is like a breath of fresh air. There`s nothing terribly interesting or exciting about it, but it`s still fun and refreshing, and find you want to take another and another. Even after a marathon of more than half the season you feel no exhaustion or tension from the condensed watching, and might even feel calmer and more content. 

Doctor`s prescription: Every time you find your life too hectic or tense, I recommend watching an episode or two.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="421763">A fine watch.

This show is all about a mature adult watching those of less maturity do `their thing` (青春, seishun). It gave me the feeling of being `an outsider` --- just as intended, I guess. The various characters had their little friend circles going on and most of this show was watching them roll, from the outside. The protagonist made an occasional intervention here and there but no more. Practically all of the character relationships were set in stone from the beginning, so the outsider-feeling came as no surprise (but as a slight disappointment, though).

If you want some quite mature content in the sense of self-reflection, then I`d recommend this, but don`t expect any romance, for there`s practically none of that in a meaningful sense (not to say there isn`t any). The drama is quite bland, but still somehow managed to escape cheesiness; stereotypical, perhaps, but pleasant to watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="118349">An interesting series, with some deep topics: highly recommended!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="306510">Really great anime!
Nice character, deep character development and a good plot.
You`d never guess this is a web anime - it`s easily one of the best anime of this season, even of this year!

Check it out, you won`t regret it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="437376">Pretty solid watch, the main character and his interactions are the most interesting part of the series and what he wrestles with whilst watching the teens really got me hooked enough to finish it in two nights. The supporting cast are rather awesome, and the expected drama does drag you in and get you quite invested.

Truly slice of life at it`s best with a unique little twist.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="713988">A really great anime. This is not a normal school anime compared to others with ecchi or funny moments. You are gonna be surprised at how amazing realistic the character developments are and start liking the characters.

Great show for everyone and especially for those who want to learn about relationships.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="729755">Honestly, such a great reflection of NEETs and their lives without having the forced "I`m an otaku because the audience is all otakus" character traits. Season 2 when?</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="390576">So warming heart, and smooth storyline. Interesting concept about slice of life, and may  change your way of life. Must see if you are fans of warm slice of life.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="527839">Hilarious, well-written and EXCELLENT character development.  Very competent main character and great pay-off despite leaving room for a second season.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="691415">This is an amazing series. the development of all the cast is astounding. I didn`t realise this was a web series until I was about to write this review. There are many laugh out loud moments and I mean loads!!!!! The animation is well on point cannot fault it one bit. The story is interesting and charming a must watch in my books if you like Romance / High School anime. You will not regret this!!!!</recommendation>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<description>Hishiro Chizuru is a very smart but socially awkward classmate of http://anidb.net/ch79914 [Arata]. She usually scores the top grades in her year, which makes her the class representative and has all her school expenses paid for as a result. She is not only socially awkward, but also fairly ignorant with regards to anything not directly related to school matters, particularly social and emotional ones. She`s always doing research online on whatever she doesn`t understand.

<description>Kaizaki Arata is a 27-year old man who only appears to be 17-years old high school student, as a result of participating as test subject in ReLife Project. He was approached by http://anidb.net/ch81232 [Yoake Ryou] who explained him the rules he need to follow and goal to achieve as a test subject, as well as gave him the pill that made him younger in appearance. Ryou also became his supervisor.
As a high school student, Arata is predictably seen as mature by his classmates and has no problem easily making friends. He has forgotten most of his high school lessons, so he needs to take many remedial tests.

Being the supervisor, he always watches over Arata from a distance, and writes a report about his daily life.

<description>Ooga Kazuomi is http://anidb.net/ch79914 [Arata]`s classmate who is the class representative along with http://anidb.net/ch79913 [Chizuru]. He performs well academically, but has very poor athletic ability. He lacks social prowess when it comes to romance, with the help of Arata and their friends he realizes his feelings for http://anidb.net/ch81235 [Rena], claiming that he wants to be with her, and doesn`t want her to be with another guy.
His older brother was once a cheerful man who became a NEET due to heavy pressure and later is chosen to take part in the ReLife program as Project #005 by http://anidb.net/ch94724 [Arata Kaizaki].

She has noticeably large breasts which are a bit of the running gag.

Despite being a genius at sports, she isn`t very good academically.
