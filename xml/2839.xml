Along the way he picks up a fellow traveller: http://anidb.net/ch15799 [Wendy], a young girl whose town he saves from bandits by summoning a mecha with his sword. Wendy is searching for her missing older brother, whose engraved gun she carries on her back. In their mutual quest they run afoul of more bandits and villains, a mysterious woman named http://anidb.net/ch15797 [Carmen 99], and more mecha battles à la Wild West.

<name>detective</name>
<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.

<name>psychotic</name>
<description>People suffering from psychosis can be described as having lost their contact with reality and deteriorated their social functioning to the point of becoming deranged. Sometimes, these people will try to achieve some absurd goal through trampling on other people, and that`s the point they become villains. Usually, psychotic villains will not show themselves to suffer from mental disorders at first, and will seem like completely normal people; however, as their story unfolds and the show progresses towards its climax, it is usual to have psychotic villains become more and more deranged, to the point of being best described by "batshit insane".</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>large breasts</name>
<description>Large breasts are breasts a fair notch larger than average, as found in some adolescent girls or fully grown women; however, as anime has no upper limit to breast size, the definition applies somewhat differently. To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>adventure</name>
<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>comedy</name>
<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>henshin</name>
<description>Japanese for "transformation" (metamorphosis or disguise).
A "henshin anime" is any anime, where the characters or their costumes transform, such as Sailor Moon. The henshin switches on the character`s special powers, and is frequently accompanied by a costume change. Often the change of clothing is the only outward indicator that the character has changed and yet nobody seems to notice the hero`s true self.
Most henshin heroes have a special item which they use to change into their heroic form. These items are usually activated by a command phrase (which is often in Engrish, for some reason), triggering a transformation sequence.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<description>Story-wise, genetic modification is usually centred on humans, probably the most subtle and creepy way of messing with mankind. Playing with the fear of the unknown, genetically altered humans are technically a new species, that may not only surpass but actually replace unaltered humans. The level of modification will vary from subtle changes in "look" (e.g. super-human beauty), to mental enhancements (PSI powers), to more or less atrocious adaptations to extreme environments (breath under water, radiation resistance). Note that changes in Aliens would be difficult to pinpoint, after all they are alien.</description>

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

<name>post-apocalyptic</name>
<description>An anime that takes place on future Earth (or it could be an alternative universe) after a major cataclysm has occurred. World War III, an alien invasion, plague, global warming or some other general disaster are common themes to build a post-apocalyptic world upon, where the effects were severe enough that mankind barely survived.
The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologised). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in an agrarian, non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of technology remain. There is a considerable degree of blurring between post-apocalyptic fiction and that which deals with false utopias or dystopian societies.</description>

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

<name>Van</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Van is the primary protagonist of the series. He is traveling the world, searching after a mysterious man with an artificial claw hand who killed his bride, Helena, on the day of their wedding. Van swore to kill this man to avenge Helena.
His primary weapon is a shape-memory cloth held at his side like a pistol. This can change configuration to a dueling sword or extend to grapple or embed itself into walls. Van can also spin it in place from its hilt at high speed to act as an efficient shield against projectiles.
Through his travels he has been given several titles, including: "Van the Unemployed", "Van the Freeloader", "Hangover Van", "Steel Van", "Invincible Van", "Pretty Van from the Garbage Dump", "Van the Unsung Hero who Gives It All He`s Got", "Van of the Dawn" (his favorite), "Daybreak Van", "Nice Guy Van", "Van that Weird Guy who Helped Out", "Van of a Thousand Conquests", "Van of a Thousand Naps" (according to Joshua), "Van, The Devil in The Poisoned Tuxedo", and "Van the Devil`s Swallowtail Suit". Although laconic and calm of nature, whenever information about the Claw`s whereabouts are mentioned, he quickly shifts to extreme anger.
His white Armor, Dann of Thursday, or simply Dann, is held in place over the planet in a crucifix-shaped satellite, and is launched to his position when he twists his hat 180 degrees and swings a `V` with his sword in the air. It is one of the strongest armors on the planet, and uses a sword as its primary weapon. Due to Van`s position as one of the "original seven" he needs to enter his armor once a week to regenerate. If he does not, he will die plus he does not age due to his surgery being one with Dann.
Van tries his best to remain uninvolved with those he meets along his way, and if he does help them, he does so out of public sight. He has an extremely low tolerance for alcohol, and drinks milk instead. When dining, he asks for all the available seasonings or all the condiments, and after smothering his dish in them he eats and yells phrases such as "DAMN THAT`S SPICY!", "GOD THAT`S GOOD!" "SO BLAND!!" and "IT`S SO COLD!". Although unexplained at first, he also possesses an unusual scar on his stomach; a circle split vertically down the center with seven lines radiating from the outside.
Van has a habit of forgetting the names of those he meets on his travels, especially Carmen, much to her chagrin. It wasn`t until later that he begins to remember consistently. The first whose name he begins to remember is Wendy. The only person`s name whom he does remember right away is Priscilla. This is because she is a strong opponent, which is he consider to be almost the same level as him, by the time when he met her. He suddenly disappears without saying goodbye, and doesn`t show up until a few years later.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Carmen 99 (real name, Carol Mendosa) is a bright and self-sufficient intelligence agent/mercenary who Van and Wendy encounter in the second episode of the anime, although Van apparently has met her before. The nickname `Carmen 99`, comes both from her bust measurement (99 cm) and the number of hidden accessories she always carries. She is often looking for more ways to earn money.
Carmen grew up in the town of Trinolia with her uncle and his daughter (having lost her parents), both of whom she shared a close friendship with until she left the town. Throughout the series, Carmen frequently leaves Van and Wendy`s company to later reunite with them, until she finally joins forces with them at the final stand to save the planet.
In the second to the last episode, she infiltrates the Clawed Man`s headquarters along with Yukiko, planting bombs along the way. Carmen winds up in a room filled with the flowers that devastated her hometown, where she confronts Fasalina, her nemesis, for the last time. While they fight, Carmen admits to being jealous of Fasalina`s directness, freedom and innocent appearance, but declares that she would rather die than become like her. When the Clawed Man dies, Fasalina begs Carmen to kill her. At first, Carmen is more than happy to do so, but when she finds Michael Garret running towards Fasalina, she spares both of them.
In the end, she also admits to liking Van very much after he finally remembers her name, though she laughs it off, knowing that it wouldn`t work between them.</description>

<description>Wendy is Van`s first travelling companion and joins him to find her brother Michael Garret who had been kidnapped by the Claw Man. Wendy is kind, compassionate, and determined and often wishes to assist those in need of help that they meet during their travel, in contrast to Van`s policy of leaving everybody to him/herself. Around her neck is a pink tortoise, Kameo, that serves as a good luck charm, given to her by her brother. In the first episode it does so by stopping an incoming bullet meant for her.
Wendy grew up in a town called Evergreen with her brother, whom she deeply cares for as he protected her from danger in her early childhood days. She carries her brother`s gun which she retrieved after his kidnapping. The gun contains only one bullet, and Wendy does not use it until the final episode of the anime, ironically uses it to shoot her brother.
A point constantly made in the series is Wendy`s coming of age. She is often irritated when people put her aside as a child and she has attempted various times to be more adult-like in Van`s presence from when he dismissed her as a brat in the first episode to go back to her town, and Wendy tells him to stop treating her as a child because she was ready to be his wife at anytime. With each progression in the story, she begins to be more ladylike as she learns more about the world. When she finally finds her brother, she decides to continue journeying with Van to find out what is right or wrong and what is true happiness, especially when she finds that she can`t deny that what the Claw Man envisioned was attracting to her. She eventually follows Yukiko in trying to help the others despite not being able to fight. Also, Wendy grows to refute Van`s statements at times, standing for her beliefs instead of subsiding. At the end, before Van departs, he remarks to her about how she`d grown since the first time he`d seen her in Evergreen.
(An older Wendy is seen years later at the end of the series, retelling the events of the series to a reporter. By that time, Kameo had grown to the size of a coffee table and Wendy`s cooking had become oriented towards how `Van liked it`, as she explains to the reporter. At that point, Van stumbles into her house unexpectedly, asking for some food and milk yet again, and the two stare at each other in shock.)
Her relationship with Van is another aspect as it presented her with a revenge-driven drifter who still managed to be kind. She goes to extensive lengths to take care of him and it has been hinted quite constantly that she has feelings for him. Wendy refers to Van as her hero in the beginning, but sheds that title from him as she learns more about him, growing closer and seeing him with his flaws and his hidden side; she refers to this part of him with a memory of `how very sweet and precious he looked when he was like that`.</description>

<name>Michael Garrett</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Michael Garret is Wendy Garret`s older brother and was her only remaining family member in Evergreen after her parents died. When they were younger, he cared very much for her, protecting her when their town of Evergreen was assaulted by bandits. He is later kidnapped by The Claw, and Wendy joins Van in order to rescue him. However, when she finally finds him, it proves out he no longer is kept with the Claw against his will. He reveals that he has joined forces with him in order to realize the Claw`s dream of eradicating all sorrow on the planet by creating a new world.
Like his sister, he is usually kind and compassionate, but can be fiercely independent when he wants to. Although he has freely joined the Claw , he still has his doubts and struggles to rid himself of his suspicious feelings against the project he has joined, especially when a mutinous group attempts to rebel and they try to get Michael to join them. But in the end, he chooses to stay with the Clawed Man, and Fasalina, with whom he ends up sharing a deep bond.
Michael is one of the only member of The Original Seven (along with Woo) who is able to control an "Original Armor" without needing surgical implants embedded into his body. This is the main reason why the Claw chose him, and Michael later proves out to be a vital part of the Claw`s plan.
He pilots the Original Seven armor Saudade of Sunday, which was launched into space and destroyed two of the Original Seven satellites. There, he encounters Van and the two of them battle, with Van constantly reminding Michael about Wendy. Whether this is a diversion tactic or Van genuinely cares very much about Wendy, it enrages Michael and he blames Van in turn for making Wendy leave Evergreen. Their fight is interrupted by an explosion brought about by the moon and the liquid-state material surrounding it, but continues when they return to the Planet of Endless Illusion, where Van also continues to scold and taunt Michael for not being a good brother. In the end, Michael is defeated and Saudade destroyed.
In the penultimate episode, he and Wendy meet again, and when he tells her to step aside as he still has to complete his mission, she points his own gun towards him, answering that he`s not the only one with a mission to complete. She ultimately shoots him in the arm when he keeps on going, using up the last bullet in the gun. Wendy begins to explain the negative effects of the Claw`s plan, which only makes Michael even angrier. He then tries to strangle her out of rage, but Wendy is saved by Kameo biting Michael`s hand. Even so, he still saves her from being crushed by falling debris, and the two siblings come to an understanding and part ways, with Michael leaving his gun with Wendy and advising her to follow her own path, while he follows his. He and his lover Fasalina seemingly perish after a boulder falls on top of them, though this is not confirmed.</description>

<name>Priscilla</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Priscilla is a pink-haired girl who met Van for the first time in an armor battle tournament. She loves to pilot her armor and gives all the prize money she wins to the efforts of her sister, Johanna, in raising orphans. Both were raised by a former Armor pilot-turned-nun who was the original owner of Brownie, Priscilla`s Armor. She controls her armor through a control interface system which allows her movements to be directly mimicked by her armor, thus taking advantage of her athletic abilities. Priscilla is a firm believer in fair play, and refused a big company`s bribe to throw a championship fight. Her personality is somewhat naive and is almost always cheerful. She later joins Van`s company and also gains a crush on him, much to Wendy`s chagrin. She is not afraid to show her feelings for Van. The Eldorado Five even once enthusiastically encouraged her to propose a marriage to him, seeing her strong feelings. Priscilla settled on a first date instead, since it was too soon to be considering marriage. In the end, her date is postponed when Van suddenly departs after fulfilling his mission to kill the Claw and avenging his wife. Priscilla vows to one day find him and have that date.
Another thing which seems to irritate Wendy (and Carmen), is that Van managed to remember Priscilla`s name almost right away after their first meeting, while he didn`t manage to remember Carmen`s name before the very last episode.</description>

<name>Ray Lundgren</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Ray is a withdrawn and ruthless Armor pilot whose wife, Shino, was killed by the Man with the claw hand. He first appears in episode 4 at the last minute, making his main appearance in episode 5 but is opposed at first to Van. Like Van, he travels to find the Man with the claw hand and exact his revenge by killing him. Unlike Van he has far fewer qualms over who dies by interfering with him, something Van despises and is easily provoked by. However, according to Joshua, he apparently was completely different in behavior prior to his wife`s death. Later in the series he reveals that he seeks to kill the Claw and then die too in order to meet Yoshimo again. Like Van, he also abstains from alcohol, drinking water instead, though drinks it in a sake cup.
Near the end of the series his eyes are injured and his vision is blurred. His vision remains blurred until he is killed on episode 24 while he tries to kill the Claw Man, his gunshots becoming more erratic with his deteriorating vision. His final shot temporarily derails the Claw`s plans by lodging itself in the timer used by the Claw Man to activate his plan. He is then killed by security vehicles and falls down the steps. He is last scene in a sort of dream sequence where Shino is still alive and he remarks on the `strange dream` he had before being reunited with her.
His rivalry with Van stems from the fact that both of them want to kill the Claw. Later in the series, they work together, although they show little concern for each other, even when engaged in combat with enemies.
Ray`s primary weapon is a katana-shaped gun with a large magazine where the blade would be. He holds it just ahead of the hilt and spins it to fire streams of bullets. He has several hidden weapons, such as the heels of his shoes. One acts as a very small hand held gun, while the other provides a way of summoning, remote-controlling, and self-destructing Volkan.
In many ways he is both very similar and opposite to Van. They both use Armors their wifes worked on, completely dedicated to kill the Claw, and are weak to alcohol. Where they are opposite is where Van wears a more western style, Ray wears more of a samurai style, Van uses a sword that looks like a gun, and Ray uses a gun that looks like a sword, Van focuses more on close combat where Ray fights with long distance, and finally Van summons his Armor from the sky where Ray summons his from the ground.

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Joshua is Ray`s brother and is talkative, upbeat and sociable. Though he deeply cares for Ray, he is entirely different in behaviour than his older brother. Joshua claims his brother changed to his present behaviour after his wife, Yoshimo`s, died at the hands of the Claw Man, and although he also loved Yoshimo, he wishes for Ray to accept her death and return home instead of exacting his revenge on her killer. Joshua has great technical skills, being able to repair numerous everyday items, analyze armor weaknesses, and even set up timed explosives. Joshua is somewhat dense when it concerns females, however, since he just walks in on Priscilla when she was taking a shower.
When he and Wendy first meet, they instantly get along, probably because they share so much in common. However, Van finds Joshua very annoying, and when Joshua is hospitalized after being injured when Ray confronts the Clawed Man for the first time in the series, Van leaves Joshua behind, but the latter manages to catch up with help from Carmen 99, and they rejoin Van and Wendy for the final showdown.
When Ray is killed, Joshua rushes to his aid, only to find himself captured by the Clawed Man. However, before Yukiko can bust him out, he has already escaped, vowing to put a stop to the plan his older brother managed to stall before dying, and saves Yukiko as well. He is instrumental in the final battle as he succeeds in cutting power to Birthday thereby halting the Claw Man`s plans.</description>

<description>Fasalina is extremely loyal to the Claw and is his right-hand woman, and will do anything to protect both him and his dream. Before being recruited, she worked as a prostitute, and is eternally grateful for being offered the opportunity to work for the Claw. When battling in her armor, Fasalina often taunts her opponents by being very flirtatious, thereby bringing them out of focus. She later develops a romantic relationship with Michael and becomes a faithful supporter of him.
When not fighting inside her armor, she uses a staff which can extend, bend or contract at her will. Carmen 99 develops a glowing animosity against Fasalina later in the series, for Fasalina corrupted Carmen`s hometown with poisonous flowers and was indirectly responsible for the death of the latter`s best friend. When the Claw is killed by Van, and the former prostitute is defeated by Carmen in their own final showdown, Fasalina begs for Carmen to kill her, after losing all of her will to live. She is later reunited with Michael only to seemingly perish with him when a boulder lands on top of them. Whether or not they had survived is in question, since they are never seen since.</description>

The two are also the final product of twin genome project in the wind valley city.

Side Note: It can be accurately assumned that both Carossa and Melissa were conceived and created in the twin city that L and R Driver came from, for the purpose of testing and assimilating control of the Sen and Sin armors(as it was built for two). And as such that would make them the last living twin specimens to survive the testing and pathological destruction that everyone else inside.</description>

<description>Carossa is a member of the Claw`s society and twin brother of Melissa, though far more aggressive and rash than her. Whenever they are together it is always he who takes the initiative. Both he and Melissa were orphans and as such he has developed a deep need for attention, especially from the Claw. He is also very protective of his sister and will attack anyone who scares her or makes her cry. Nearly from the beginning, he develops a growing sense of animosity of Michael, partly because he becomes the centre of the Claw`s attention (due to his importance in his plan) and partly because Melissa develops a crush on him. Both siblings are members of The Original Seven and appear to be the result of research using a mental link between twins. Ray mercilessly kills both of them with his rifle during a last stand to delay the protagonists` approach to the Claw.

<description>Woo (full name, William Will Woo) is a member of the Original Seven and heir to a noble family. He appears cold and collected on the outside, but is filled with rage and turmoil on the inside. Woo suffered from the Oedipus complex, or he regarded his father as an adversary and competitor for the exclusive love of his mother. When Woo was an adolescent, he attacked his father with a knife in an attempt to kill him, but his mother jumped in the way and took the hit instead and was killed. After that, Woo left the township his family had governed due to the painful memories, and left it to succumb to decay. However he says he returned to this place to intercept Van, and that this proved he had finally succeeded. William had become increasingly mentally unstable since then and seeks to unleash his pent-up rage in any way he can. He also calls Van and Gadved `Old types`. Van kills him after luring him towards Dann on top of his castle and they clash in a fight of wills where it is revealed that William `abandoned his mother for his father`s sake` (This, along with silhouettes of his parents shown in flashbacks, suggest that his father was the Claw Man). Van then challenges this by saying that no one who abandons their true love can defeat him.
In Super Robot Wars K, it is confirmed that the Claw Man was indeed his father.

In the series, Van discovers to his enormous shock that Gadved has become one of the Claw`s followers. He also reveals that he was the one who told the Claw Man where to find Van`s wife. He is a veteran armor pilot and the last surviving member of the former generation of Original Seven pilots which he says had become corrupted, especially after the fall of the Mother Planet Earth. He is the first of the pilots to be killed by Van after they both agree to share the same dream, and the outcome of their battle was to prove who had the better conviction. In end, Van won out.

<description>The Claw Man, whose real name remained a mystery throughout the series, is a mastermind with a prosthetic claw for a right hand and is the primary antagonist of the series. He killed both Van`s and Ray`s wives, and is the subject of their furious lust for revenge. Before episode 12, he is only shown in flashbacks as a shadowy figure with the claw hand. In episode 12 however, Wendy runs into a kind, old man who helps her in overcoming her sorrow for her brother. Immediately after the conversation, it is revealed that this man is the claw man when he abruptly screws on his claw hand, to Wendy`s horror.
Later in the series, it is revealed he plans to create a new world which supposedly will bring happiness to all people and eradicate all sins one has committed during life, regardless of whether the people want it or not, and totally ignoring those who were already happy to begin with. His plan apparently is to change the world by dissolving himself and then combining with everyone and everything on the planet on a subconscious level, perhaps acting as a sort of conscience for people. It is never made clear what exactly would happen to civilization or to himself, nor how the process would occur. It was described by Wendy as `Mental terrorism`.
Near the end of the series, it is revealed the Moon, as controlled by Birthday, could be used as a terraformer. The Claw Man hints that he intends to terraform the Endless Illusion into the perfect world he dreams of. It is implied that the entire population of the planet will be killed during the process and will be reborn in the new world. It is unclear whether this rebirth is possible as the Claw Man is very clearly insane.
The plan was also violently opposed by some of his crew members, claiming he was planning on committing genocide. In one of the episodes they attempt to commit a coup against him in order to force him into revealing the details for his plans. During the negotiations, the Claw seems to strongly prefer talk instead of violence, insisting that genocide is not part of his plans. This pacifism and goodwill is debatable, as minutes later, he kills one of the rebels by hugging him (apparently of love) while slashing his back with the claw. When he relinquishes him and discovers he is dead, he breaks into shock, saying "I did it again", and repeatedly apologizing, as if unaware of his embrace being lethal for the rebel. He also shows very little sadness and is somewhat indifferent whenever one of the Original Seven is killed by Van or Ray, maintaining that as long as he has the DNA samples of each pilot, his plan will succeed.
To realize his plans, he gathers a society of loyal and devoted followers (including Wendy`s brother Michael and Van`s mentor Gadved), six of whom are pilots of the Original Seven save Dann of Thursday. Within this society he is only known as "The Comrade".
He wears simple clothes most of the time, despite being the leader. In the final episodes however he replaced this with a white outfit with a chain which leads from his collar down. This is later seen to be the standard uniform of the scientists when Michael sees their remains, all of them wearing the same sort of clothing. He also is shown to like gardening, and the company of animals. In general, he is shown to engage in creative and nurturing activities. Though he appears to be a kind and somewhat absent-minded old man, the Comrade is actually very insane and does not admit to any kind of wrongdoing, despite the fact that nearly all of his actions have caused death and misery to innocents. He always rationalizes his acts as being ultimately for the good of mankind. Another driving force to his insanity is due to his impending death, probably brought about by an illness.
It was revealed later in Episode 23 that the Claw Man managed to escape the Mother Planet `Earth` along with a collection of other people. Apparently, they loved each other at first, but then they began killing each other leaving only the Claw Man left. This is what inspired him to "make the world a peaceful place with my own hands".
His plan is halted before its completion when Van and his allies stop the process and the Claw meets his end as Van cuts him in half with his sword. During the final battle, the Claw shows the scope of his insanity by saying things like `Amazing! I have so many new friends!` and finally `Van... I really like you` before Van slices him in half.
Super Robot Wars K has confirmed The Claw Man`s real name to be Koo Krying Kroo (クー・クライング・クルー), William Woo`s father.</description>
