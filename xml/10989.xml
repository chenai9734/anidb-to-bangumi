<description>I-city is Hong Kong Art Centre`s first animation creation project. A collaboration by more than ten young animators (among them Hong Kong Independent Short Films and Video Awards winners) of different artistic style that took a year, from inception to completion, to come into being, it is Hong Kong`s first ever large scale collective creation. Comprised of nine animations, each an execution in individual style and content and technique breakthrough, some nostalgic, some critical, some hopeful, but all try to bring i-city to life in animation, the work is a tribute to i-city by thirteen animators in fluidic poetry.
