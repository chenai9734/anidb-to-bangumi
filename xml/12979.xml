<description>Known as the "Galactic Fairy", she is a pop idol from Macross Galaxy fleet who had constantly topped music charts leading people to say that it was impossible not to hear her songs if you lived in this galaxy. As such, her popularity was soaring just as high in the Galaxy`s sister fleet, Macross Frontier. Due to her beauty and singing talent, she is a very proud and self-assured person. Sheryl recognizes the singing talent of Ranka Lee and often offers to help her `behind the scenes` to realise her dream of singing. Sheryl`s first encounter with Alto Saotome was when he served as a backup `performer` at her first concert in Frontier. Eventually, she also develops a crush on him.</description>
