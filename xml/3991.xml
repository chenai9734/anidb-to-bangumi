<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>comedy</name>
<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>Di Gi Charat</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The main character of the story. She is also known as Chocola but despite this alternate name implying she likes chocolate, she prefers broccoli. Dejiko has a Type A personality and can be aggressive at times.
Dejiko dresses up as a catgirl and is the princess of Planet Di Gi Charat. She is ten years old when she comes to Earth with hopes of becoming an idol singer. She has green eyes and green hair and her maid-like uniform consists of a white and navy blue dress with big cat bells tied to her hair with navy blue ribbons. On the very top of her head are her cat ears, which are white with pink inside and have a set of large, non-functional yellow cat eyes. She always wears white gloves and boots (with the exception of her sleeping outfit) and she has a white tail.
She has the ability to use her eye-beam weapon called the Me kara BEAM!. She ends each sentence with nyo.</description>

<name>Puchi Charat</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Dejiko`s five year old sidekick and a catgirl. Puchiko is quiet and has a Type B personality. She has the ability to use an eye-beam similar to Dejiko`s but is often too docile to conjure the aggression required to perform such a feat. This has caused many things to come out of her eyes, including sludge, when she attempts to use it.
Puchiko has brown hair and dark brown eyes. She wears a schoolgirl-type uniform plus cat bells in her hair, though they are much smaller than Dejiko`s. She wears orange boots, cat ears and tail. She ends each sentence with nyu.</description>

<description>The Princess of planet Analogue and leader of the Black Gema Gema Gang.

She had to flee to earth because she blew up a city and couldn`t pay for repairs. Piyoko`s dresses similar to that of a nurse`s uniform, but in black and white colors like a panda. She ends her sentences with "pyo". She has an attack similar to Dejiko`s Laser Eye Beam called Upchuck Bazooka which is a beam that comes from her mouth, but whenever she attempts to attack Dejiko with it, she more often than not gets attacked herself.</description>
