<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="430122">It`s a decent season, but it moves away form the fuzzy heartwarming feeling of the first season and becomes more of a serious drama/romance. It feels forced and definitely doesn`t live up to the first season. It`s good, just not great.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="497799">2nd Season, but defintly not as good as the first one! This one dragged the whole story line ... took forever to finish. @ some parts, had to fast forward because it was so predictable. Hmph. Still I enjoy love stories.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="79179">this anime is kinda draggin on and on.... it needs talent to be able to drag this anime for so long.

all the stupid lame misunderstanding between kazehaya and kuronuma is very hard to watch. it already takes very long before "dating", imagine how long it will be during dating. 

i agreed its a heart warming anime, but its too long..... i am real sorry, i cant stand anymore, gonna drop it for the sake of "my life". those which arent brave enough are not qualified to love. if you want to love, then you must be brave. 

sawako and kazahaya is a great pair, but because sawako is such a coward. i dont expect them to have ANY future. kazehaya should just forget bout the gloomy girl and date kurumi!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="61503">I can only say this.

I love it, every minute of it.
It really grows and expands on my feelings.

HIGHLY recommended to watch this and if you have friends that hasn`t seen much anime, i even recommend this even more.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="8470">the heartwarming story continued and gave a finale as it was hoped for when you watched season 1</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="385395">well, i thought they would have developped a lot more of the story (comparing it wit the manga), but it looks like we must wait another year from another season to come...wish they make it!!!! Watch it, it`ll make you laugh and cry!!! It`s a nice, cute and tender anime!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="280405">The beauty of this comes from leaving a good impression to the audience. It is about a young girl in love. It leaves a warm feeling. It does not have plot as its strong point. It is like looking at a good picture or listening to good music, you want to experience it again and again.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="260343">More fast paced and dramatic then the first season without losing any of that heart warming feeling that transpires from it. Amazing character and story development.
Definetly a must see!</recommendation>

<description>Due to her long black hair and dark aura, http://anidb.net/ch11135 [Kuronuma Sawako]`s classmates avoided her and called her Sadako. However, after entering high school, she met http://anidb.net/ch11136 [Kazehaya Shouta]. Kazehaya possesses a bright personality and is popular with everyone. Sawako gained the courage to change her life from Kazehaya and has experienced much since that time. During all this, Sawako`s feelings towards Kazehaya grew ever deeper, and now she must come to grips with them.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<description>Usually girly tears are the ones not shed by men (duh). 
Like when a (stereotypical) girl watches something and cries her makeup out, a (stereotypical) dude just says, proclaiming his masculinity: "Meh, yet another soap opera bulls..t, I`ll be in my garage fixing my ride while playing heavy metal on a burning guitar ...with my teeth! And where`s my beer, woman?".
So that`s how it goes: girly tears are for girls and sissies! Chuck Norris forbid a guy would weep watching something that has this tag! Now 20 push-ups!
P.S. The opposite of "manly tears". Or is it? Let`s face it - it`s all subjective (and relative, and context-dependent).</description>

<description>Sawako is a shy yet honest girl who is in search of friendship, but her resemblance to horror film character Sadako and Sawako`s tendency to shy away from correcting people of misconceptions prevent her from doing so. Thanks to Kazehaya`s kind and open nature, she is able to gradually make friends, open up to her classmates, and talk to different people. She is grateful (and at first, worships) Kazehaya for giving her the opportunities to make close friends, which come to include Yano, Yoshida, Kazehaya and Ryuu.</description>

<description>Kazehaya is Sawako`s outgoing and friendly classmate. He is so popular that during middle school, so many girls liked him that they formed a "Kazehaya is Everyone`s" Alliance in order to maintain some level of peace among his admirers and more than half of these girls now attend the same high school. Kazehaya has held a long standing interest in Sawako and admits (though not to Sawako) that he likes her, unaware that she feels the same for him.</description>

<name>Yoshida Chizuru</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Yoshida is another close friend of Sawako. She is the tomboy of the group. She has a soft spot for innocent mannered people, so she takes a near instant liking to Sawako. In Kurumi`s fake rumours it was passed around that she was a former Yankee, though Chizuru just takes the rumour as a means of scaring people off or as a joke for her friends. Chizuru is mostly only the slower side of things; she did not realise that Kazehaya liked Sawako until late in the series, after they started their second year of high school.
She is a close childhood friend with Sanada Ryu, who is also the son of her favourite ramen shop`s owner, and went to the same middle school as Kazehaya. She has a crush on Ryu`s brother, Tooru.</description>

<name>Yano Ayane</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Ayane is a close friend of Sawako. She is the arguably the most mature of the group and she has a boyfriend in college. In Kurumi`s fake rumours, it is said that Ayane has played more with more than 100 guys in middle school. In their current high school, it is being said that Yano and Yoshida have pretty much authority in the year group. Perceptive and intelligent, a trait of Ayane`s personality is that she gives just enough information to leave others wondering, thus forcing them to move forward. Although she is usually calm and collected, she is easily infuriated if someone hurts Sawako and does not hesitate to attack the one responsible she believes is responsible (frequently Kazehaya) with kicks and sharp words.</description>

<description>Ryuu is also member of Sawako`s group of friends. He is quiet most of the time and rarely talks, but still can communicate well with Sawako, as they both don`t talk much anyway. He is a close childhood friend with Chizuru and does not deny having feelings for her. Ryuu and Kazehaya became friends when they were on the baseball team during middle school.</description>

<description>The temporarily homeroom teacher for Sawako`s class, taking over when the previous homeroom teacher became sick during the summer holidays while Sawako was helping him. He is nicknamed Pin and always is called that way, except Sawako who obeys the formalities and still calls him Arai-sensei. Pin is a great fan of baseball as well as the school baseball team`s coach. He used to be part of Kazehaya`s father`s league team, so he has known Shouta since when he was young. A loud and eccentric man prone to believing the silliest things, Pin apparently enjoys interrupting people. He had nicknamed the puppy that Sawako and Kazehaya found by the river "Pedro Martinez" after the legendary baseball pitcher.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A girl who appears friendly and sweet to everyone around her, she has had a huge crush on Kazehaya since their first year of middle school. She dislikes her given name, Ume, because it sounds old-fashioned and prefers to be called her nickname, "Kurumi." She is extremely jealous of Sawako, which led her to spread fake rumours of Sawako`s only friends at the time, Yoshida and Yano, using Sawako`s name. Kurumi does not attend the same class as Sawako or Kazehaya.
She eventually confesses her love to Kazehaya, but receives an expected rejection. Because she is always surprised with Sawako`s naiveté, Kurumi is able to become friends with her, as well as a rival for Kazehaya`s affection. Following Kazehaya`s rejection, she becomes colder to her classmates, but is able to finally express her true feelings and personality.</description>

He cares about Ryuu and Chizuru a lot and loves Chizuru like a little sister. He calls her Chi because when she says it, it looks like she`s smiling.</description>
