<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="188970">Highly overrated anime, only for Hollywood super hero movie fans, story = 0.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="479343">For you who likes to watch an easy story and not too much complexity, this is the tittle for you.

It`s just so easy to follow, easy to guess. But it has a plus in the animation works. The CGI job were great.

Also, the animation works and character design were something like from a western comic books (like Batman, Spider-man, Superman), so if you`re a serious Japanese Anime lover, I don`t think this is the tittle for you.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="241461">this show is so overrated. main char is so stupid that u get angry when watching. the story is very predictable, the only thing this show hade was the graphic wich was very nice.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="228848">The end got me on this show. It has the most maturity I`ve seen from a lot of anime. It`s not about teenagers trying to figure out who they are, but about an older guy trying to find himself again. The show deals with the problem of getting old and confronting responsibilities and situations that arise as we get older. Kotetsu, who is Tiger, one of the main leads of the anime, shows an example of how we can deal with unexpected challenges and not run-away or get depressed about it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="283829">I will always remember this one for its first episode. Afterwards was somewhat of a letdown compared to Ep1, but still watchable. Picks up pretty well towards the (hackneyed) end.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="188990">Turn off your brain and just watch type of show. Nice animation, very enjoyable.
Obvious product placement is simply LoL.
Some characters who could have developed more but each get`s their spotlight.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="387470">There were many a times I din`t wanna watch this anime after looking at few of the recommendations. But after I gave it a shot, I was so surprised and seriously felt sorry for myself to have been misled by the reviews. This does have a super hero element in it, but the character development, the conspiracy, the funny lead character everything comes together nicely and makes it a good watch for everybody. Once I started watching, I stopped only after it completed. This is really a good show and make sure you don`t miss it.
P.S: Lot of people direct their anger towards the main character for being goofy, but in my opinion he is suited for this. The seiyuu for tiger is Hirata Hiroaki who also pulls off nanba mutta in Uchuu Kyoudai and their characters are very similar.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="244372">Refreshing, fun to watch, you wont get bored!
No need to overanalyze it its just pure fun ride.
Japan`s x-man !</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="587228">Take the X-Men mutant concept, throw in reality TV gameshow, and sponsorships like Nascar and you get Tiger and Bunny.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="280899">Easy to watch, light and enjoyable :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="834921">Perfect anime if you hate modern comic books and their movies.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="396751">This is an enjoyable show overall and, while it lacks drama, its atmosphere is nice. It is worth watching.

The Good: The characters were enjoyable to watch and the story had a nice rythm to it.

The Bad: The secondary cast aren`t very developped and the premise is somewhat left behind. Some of the more interesting themes (superheroes working for compagnies) had no impact on the story and were poorly used.

The Ugly: CG and animation don`t mix very well and this is a very good example. Some plot armor and a weak finale.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="167349">I was VERY skeptical to this anime at the beginning because it looked kind of stupid... The story, the sci art and the name. But after watching the first episode I fell in love with this anime! Tiger &amp; Bunny is the best anime in 2011 no doubt!!!!!!!!!! ^^=</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="301367">Show about somewhat commercialized Heroes, having their own HeroTV. Inspired by american superhero series. Good visuals, nice story, great characters.</recommendation>

<description>The city of Sternbild is home to many people of different races, backgrounds, and those who are called Next. Next are people who possess special powers. They are the superheroes who protect peace within the city.
These heroes all have a corporate sponsor whose logo is displayed upon their backs. As they overcome disasters and save people, they improve the image of their sponsors. In addition, they earn Hero Points which determines their ranking on the popular Hero TV programme. The Hero with the most points gains the title of King of Heroes.
One of these Heroes is http://anidb.net/ch26673 [Wild Tiger] (http://anidb.net/ch26674 [Kaburagi T. Kotetsu]), a hotheaded veteran with a strong sense of justice. One day, he is suddenly partnered-off with newbie http://anidb.net/ch26676 [Barnaby Brooks Jr.].

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>An anime that takes place in an alternative past is an anime that clearly does not belong to the future or the present, and isn`t tied particularly closely to our history, or has ties to our history but only as a premise: there are too many things that don`t make sense for the time-period. In some cases there is futuristic technology present, but the overall setting still feels that of the past. However the setting must still take place on Earth, since we can not know if the history of a fantasy world is an alternate one or not.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<description>The conspiracy thriller (or paranoid thriller) is a sub-genre of the thriller which flourished in the 1970s in the US (and was echoed in other parts of the world) in the wake of a number of high-profile scandals and controversies (most notably Vietnam, the assassination of President Kennedy, Chappaquiddick and Watergate), and which exposed what many people regarded as the clandestine machinations and conspiracies beneath the orderly fabric of political life.
The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top".</description>

There are several such squads: Whereas Section 9 of Ghost in the Shell is an official government organisation, there are also "benevolent" vigilante groups like the Knight Sabers (Bubblegum Crisis).
Criminal syndicates also have their special forces e.g. "death squads".</description>

<description>A hero complex is a state of mind in which an individual believes they need to save or assist others, uphold morals, serve justice, or perform other such supposedly hero-like acts, often at any cost. That is a common trait among vigilantes. Those with a hero complex may feel personally accountable for any failure at those self-assigned duties. Their main concern is performing their supposedly heroic deeds; any questions others might raise about such actions are all secondary concerns at best. Such questions can include, but are not limited to: who is to be saved; what are they to be saved from; why are they being saved; whether or not the other person needs or wants to be saved at all; whether or not others share in the sense of morals and justice being upheld; how people feel about the so-called heroic actions; whether people feel like those actions are being forced down their throats; what negative effects can arise from such actions.</description>

Increasingly it is created by means of 3D computer graphics, though 2D computer graphics are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time rendering needs. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another medium, such as film.</description>

Making it very unlikely for them to appear in the same context. Non-the-less they share the same adventure, as in "opposites attract".
These differences are exploited to come up with all sorts of wacky situations.
Examples: A demon-killer or Hero and the daughter of the Demon King. A girl from a normal family and a very intelligent and attractive boy from a very rich background (Shoujo). A very energetic outgoing girl and her very calm almost introverted best friend.</description>

<description>For some reason, the protagonist`s mother is no longer among the living. The much-too-early death was due to sickness or accident.
This plot device adds a certain degree of tragedy to the anime, and usually has repercussions on the rest of the family. For example: the grief-stricken father and children barely function as humans; the oldest daughter has an extra burden of raising the other children, additional emphasis is given to the only female child in the family, i.e. with bishounen brother and dad in a shoujo setting.
In rare cases the mother may still be alive, just not living with the rest of the family presently, i.e. on some quest or job and gone for a long time.</description>

<description>Somewhere down the line, it became the "norm" that boys don`t cry. The scenario does not matter; shedding tears is the ultimate no-no in terms of what you can and cannot do as a man (at least in the West, anyway). But there comes a time when a man`s emotions do get the better of him, and they pour forth - as prerequisite an impassioned speech may or may not be present - by cascading down his cheeks. These are what we like to call "manly tears". Extremely powerful. Not limited but often used in hot-blooded / super robot shows. Examples include Yuusha Ou GaoGaiGar, Getter Robo and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.
The opposite of manly tears are "girly tears".</description>

As a NEXT he possesses Hundred Power, a power that, once activated, increases his physical abilities by 100 times for five minutes. Kotetsu is driven by a strong sense of justice and he has a firm belief in his self-image as a Hero; thus, he keeps his real identity a secret. He does not care about racking up points to increase his rank at Hero TV, and instead he attempts his best to save civilians and bring criminals to justice. Kotetsu is incredibly reckless, which often leads him to cause propriety damage, a habit that awarded his Hero persona the nickname "The Crusher of Justice". In spite of being depicted as silly and clumsy, Kotetsu can be passionate and serious, especially if to preserve the well-being of those around him.</description>

Despite coming across as cold-hearted and stoic, Barnaby does care about others; he is simply tormented by his tragic past and pushed forward by a need for revenge.

<description>Alexander Lloyds is one of the secondary characters of the series "Tiger &amp; Bunny". He was employed by Apollon Media to serve as the manager of the first Hero duo in the history of Sternbild, composed of Barbany and Wild Tiger. At first, Lloyds favours Barnaby, treating Wild Tiger as a sidekick. A common gag consisted in Wild Tiger complaining about his job and Lloyds telling him he could leave if he did not like it.
[spoiler]After Jake Martinez`s death, Lloyds starts to treat Wild Tiger in a friendlier manner.[spoiler]</description>

<description>Antonio Lopez is one of the secondary characters of the series "Tiger &amp; Bunny" and the one behind the guise of the Hero Rock Bison. As a NEXT he possesses Impenetrable Skin, a power that, once activated, grants the user invulnerability from harm. He is a close friend of Kotetsu and often goes out to have a drink with him. Contrary to his tough appearance, Antonio`s personality has a fragile side to it. He has gained the nickname "Bull Tank of the West Coast" because of how he charges through enemies using his thick-head, or giant drill shoulders.</description>

<description>H-01 is the replacement for Wild Tiger brought after Barnaby`s memories were manipulated. At first thought to be a person, it is in truth a cyborg created by Rotwang to destroy the Heroes, so they could be replaced by cyborgs. H-01 is shown to be a terrific battler that does not suffer from the limitations brought by Hero powers.</description>
