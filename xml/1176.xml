<description>The story continues to follow the adventures of Section 9`s top members, Motoko Kusanagi, Batou, and Togusa. For this second season, Innocence-famed director Mamoru Oshii contributed with his ideas to the concept of the entire series right from the initial planning stages. The series maintains an episodic format and portrays Section 9 dealing with political issues such as invited refugees and nuclear intrigue. Another government institution, the Information Bureau of the Cabinet, comes up head-to-head against them. And a terrorist entity who calls itself the "Individual Eleven" joins the set. The in-depth storytelling of the series is likely to surpass the first series.</description>

<name>military</name>
<description>The military, also known as the armed forces, are forces authorized and legally entitled to use deadly force so as to support the interests of the state and its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its citizens and the prosecution of war against foreign powers. The military may also have additional functions within a society, including construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding critical areas.

<name>detective</name>
<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.

<name>artificial intelligence</name>
<description>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science that aims to create it. AI textbooks define the field as "the study and design of intelligent agents" where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success. John McCarthy, who coined the term in 1956, defines it as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines."
The field was founded on the claim that a central property of humans, intelligence—the sapience of Homo sapiens—can be so precisely described that it can be simulated by a machine. This raises philosophical issues about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings, issues which have been addressed by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity. Artificial intelligence has been the subject of optimism, but has also suffered setbacks and, today, has become an essential part of the technology industry, providing the heavy lifting for many of the most difficult problems in computer science.
AI research is highly technical and specialized, and deeply divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other. Subfields have grown up around particular institutions, the work of individual researchers, the solution of specific problems, longstanding differences of opinion about how AI should be done and the application of widely differing tools. The central problems of AI include such traits as reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, communication, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence (or "strong AI") is still among the field`s long term goals.</description>

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>cyborg</name>
<description>A cyborg is a cybernetic organism (i.e. an organism that has both artificial and natural systems). The term was coined in 1960 when Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline used it in an article about the advantages of self-regulating human-machine systems in outer space. D. S. Halacy`s Cyborg: Evolution of the Superman in 1965 featured an introduction which spoke of a "new frontier" that was "not merely space, but more profoundly the relationship between `inner space` to `outer space` -a bridge...between mind and matter." The cyborg is often seen today merely as an organism that has enhanced abilities due to technology, but this perhaps oversimplifies the category of feedback.
Fictional cyborgs are portrayed as a synthesis of organic and synthetic parts, and frequently pose the question of difference between human and machine as one concerned with morality, free will, and empathy. Fictional cyborgs may be represented as visibly mechanical (e.g. the Cybermen in the Doctor Who franchise or The Borg from Star Trek); or as almost indistinguishable from humans (e.g. the "Human" Cylons from the re-imagining of Battlestar Galactica). The 1970s television series The Six Million Dollar Man featured one of the most famous fictional cyborgs. Cyborgs in fiction often play up a human contempt for over-dependence on technology, particularly when used for war, and when used in ways that seem to threaten free will. Cyborgs are also often portrayed with physical or mental abilities far exceeding a human counterpart (military forms may have inbuilt weapons, among other things).
Real (as opposed to fictional) cyborgs are more frequently people who use cybernetic technology to repair or overcome the physical and mental constraints of their bodies. While cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals, they can be any kind of organism.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>existentialism</name>
<description>Most commonly defines the rejection of a god and any transcendent will that dictates how humans should live. It rejects any "created" meaning of life and the world, stating a leap of faith is required to live an authentic life. In this existentialism, belief in a god is often considered a form of Bad Faith.
In length, the Absurd contains ideas that there is no meaning in the world beyond what meaning it`s given. Meaninglessness also encompasses amorality or "unfairness" of the world. This contrasts with "karmic" ways of thinking in which "bad things don`t happen to good people"; there is no such thing as a good person or a bad thing; what happens happens, and it may just as well happen to a good person as to a bad person. This contrasts daily experience where most things appear meaningful, and where good people receive a "reward" for goodness.</description>

<name>Kusanagi Motoko</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kusanagi Motoko is a http://anidb.net/t2180 [cyborg] in the employ of http://anidb.net/ch1590 [Public Security Section 9], a fictional division of the real Japanese National Public Safety Commission, as the squad leader.
Little is known of Kusanagi`s early history, though the television series hints at some of her background, usually through flashbacks; commonly from the points of view of others, rarely from Kusanagi`s. Notably, the opening sequence of the http://anidb.net/a247 [Stand Alone Complex series], episodes number 8 "http://anidb.net/e5276 [The Fortunate Ones - MISSING HEARTS]" and 37 "http://anidb.net/e19413 [Kusanagi`s Labyrinth - AFFECTION]" which seem to imply that Kusanagi has spent most of her life in a prosthetic body.
Motoko Kusanagi`s various incarnations in the different manga or movies or TV series all portray her differently. Since each of these have independent storylines, the physical and mental characteristics of Motoko Kusanagi has been modified in different ways to reflect the focus of the story; these changes are reflected in the different ways that artists draw her.
In the 2nd Gig episode "Kusanagi`s Labyrinth - AFFECTION" it is revealed that as a young child Kusanagi was involved in a plane crash, the only other survivor of which was http://anidb.net/ch10194 [Kuze Hideo] who later became a member of the "Individual Eleven". After spending an undefined period of time in a coma Kusanagi`s ghost was transferred into a fully cybernetic body, presumably without her prior consent. After this she visited Kuze Hideo in hospital since he was still paralysed from the injuries he had suffered in the crash and eventually convinced him to undergo the cyberisation procedure himself.
At the end of the series Kusanagi confessed that she couldn`t remember what her real name was, indicating that Motoko Kusanagi is actually only a pseudonym, just as Kuze Hideo`s name is as well.</description>

He also tends to be the most emotional and temperamental, getting so outraged at one criminal committing murder right under his nose in an episode of http://anidb.net/a1176 [Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG] he seriously wounded the man and ends up on trial. He seems very friendly with http://anidb.net/ch1584 [Batou] and he was arguably the one who cracked the Laughing Man case.</description>

He also has optical implant eyes of a similar general design to Batou`s, though his optics are a different colour and might be another model with different capabilities. Both his eyes and his baldness are his trademark features.
In addition to his role as Section 9`s explosives specialist, Borma often handles the task of rear support. In most assignments, he`s the only member to carry heavy weaponry. He also works as the team`s resident cyberviral warfare expert, often developing vaccines for viruses within minutes of their creation.

At one point, Borma was in the JSDF as a demolitions expert, possibly hinting that he was either a combat engineer or a special forces operative. It`s also been speculated that he was a "virgin" at the time of his cyberization since he was affected by the Individual Eleven virus.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kayabuki Youko is Japan`s newly elected prime minister in http://anidb.net/a1176 [Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG].
Kayabuki first appears in the second season of Stand Alone Complex and is elected as Japan`s first female prime minister. She reinstates http://anidb.net/ch1590 [Section 9] after a deal was made with http://anidb.net/ch1588 [Aramaki] in the Stand Alone Complex, 2 years after the raid by Umibozu commandos on Section 9`s headquarters.
Politically, she was selected by the ruling party as an internal political movement to conservatism in the wake of the Laughing Man scandal that brought down the previous government.
However, she was perceived as being politically weak - the Cabinet at this time was increasing in political power and becoming led by personality rather than by electoral responsibility.
The undercurrent of secret manipulation by the Cabinet Intelligence Agency through the Individual Eleven / Refugee Crisis sought to make the Prime Minister a rubber stamping figurehead.
Kayabuki becomes a victim of the Individual Eleven and is involved with Section 9`s investigation into the case. During the refugee crisis, she is arrested under charges of treason for requesting UN intervention in the crisis, though this action on the part of the Ruling Party chairman was not sanctioned by either party, or electorate - her escape from custody and the aid of Section 9 prevented this secret coup d`état from becoming a reality, and also then sent a clear signal to the American Empire that Japan prefers a Stand-alone status within the international community.
This demonstration of capability, and the calling in of favours owed at the height of the crisis increased her ability to control Japan in the wake thereof. She also demonstrated that she held clout from a military stand-point: The JASDF was her tool of choice for reminding the contending land and sea force commanders where Japan`s true military prowess was to be found, from both a domestic and military stand-point.
Kayabuki displayed great wisdom by selecting Daisuke Aramaki and http://anidb.net/ch1582 [Major Kusanagi] as personal advisors that prevented potentially cataclysmic events during the beginning of her premiership.
She appears briefly in http://anidb.net/a4414 [Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. Solid State Society], where she remains Prime Minister, and Daisuke Aramaki`s immediate superior.
This character was created by http://anidb.net/cr205 [Kamiyama Kenji] of http://anidb.net/cr721 [Production IG] - not http://anidb.net/cr871 [Shirow Masamune] and is exclusive to the TV series.</description>

<description>Uchikoma is a green 1-man tank (walker/roller) briefly used by members of http://anidb.net/ch1590 [Section 9] in the TV Anime http://anidb.net/a4414 [Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. Solid State Society]
At the end of the TV series http://anidb.net/a1176 [Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG] the http://anidb.net/ch9577 [Tachikomas] sacrifice their AI`s in order to prevent a nuclear detonation. They are replaced by Fuchikoma/Tachikoma hybrids, referred to as Uchikomas, similar to the Fuchikoma think-tanks used in the original Ghost In The Shell manga.
"Uchikoma" is the correct pronunciation, as clearly indicated in Japanese literature dealing with the subject, where they are referred to as Uchikoma. The subtitles on volume 7 of the Region 1 DVDs, released by Bandai Entertainment, unmistakably call the new think-tanks "Fuchikoma", which is incorrect. The packaging art for the model kit, however, clearly labels the units "Uchikoma".</description>

<description>Gouda Kazundo is a fictional character in http://anidb.net/cr871 [Shirow Masamune]`s Ghost in the Shell anime series. He is the primary antagonist of http://anidb.net/a1176 [Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG]. In the series, Gouda is head of a data manipulation division within the Cabinet Intelligence Service.
While on a mission, Gouda was involved in an accident and had to have cybernetic parts installed. He was horribly disfigured, but, curiously, chose not to repair his face with easily available cybernetic parts. During a failed training exercise by the Japanese military for its new helicopters, Gouda was dispatched to approach http://anidb.net/ch1588 [Aramaki] with a plan of action to protect the people living in the Refugee Residential District. Gouda later becomes a main suspect in the Individual Eleven case by http://anidb.net/ch1590 [Section 9]. He is the head of the Strategic Influence Investigation Commission within Japan`s Cabinet Intelligence Service, a position which gives him the power to carry out his plans. In addition, he has a valuable ally in Chief Cabinet Secretary Takakura, who aids Gouda`s cause, seemingly to further his own political aspirations.</description>

During the Dejima crisis Proto played a key role in helping http://anidb.net/ch1588 [Aramaki] rescue the Prime Minister http://anidb.net/ch17466 [Kayabuki Youko], who had been relieved of her duty and arrested under charges of treason.
Proto managed to gain access to the net, where he communicated with Section 9`s Tachikoma units. Through them Proto was able to gain building blueprints and up-to-date information on Section 9`s Dejima operation, as well as the location of the Prime Minister, before an attack barrier disabled him. Proto appears again in the http://anidb.net/a4414 [Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. Solid State Society] movie, wearing the black uniform of Section 9 along with a sidearm, which suggests that he is now a field officer.</description>

<description>The Individual Eleven is a fictional terrorist group that http://anidb.net/ch1590 [Public Security Section 9] dealt with inhttp://anidb.net/a1176 [ Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG].
The Individual Eleven`s motive for terror is an essay also entitled "The Individual Eleven", which is, in reality, a fake essay implanted with a computer virus that infects all who read it. It even infected http://anidb.net/ch16591 [Borma] of Section 9, although he showed no further signs of symptoms as a result. The virus remains dormant up until the user downloads all of the other ten essays by Patrick Sylvestre (a fictional political theorist), when it programs the person infected by it to commit suicide. However, it seems the virus itself does not cause the members of the Individual Eleven to commit the acts of terror, it is their own political views which cause them to do so. The virus only seems to be there to make them, perhaps, unwilling martyrs, as all the members of the primary Individual Eleven (except http://anidb.net/ch10194 [Kuze]) kill each other with swords in a televised mass suicide. Although these eleven were apparently the primary members, it is likely that other people, such as the refugees that committed suicide bombings, could be considered as a part of the Individual Eleven because they were also infected with the virus.
The eleventh essay supposedly refers to the events surrounding the May 15th Incident, which was one of several incidents that led to the rise of Japanese militarism.
It should be noted that the virus only affects those who possess cyberbrains, and, in addition, it is suggested by http://anidb.net/ch17488 [Gouda Kazundo] that the virus affects only those individuals who were virgins prior to undergoing full cyberization.</description>
