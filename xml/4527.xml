<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>manly tears</name>
<description>Somewhere down the line, it became the "norm" that boys don`t cry. The scenario does not matter; shedding tears is the ultimate no-no in terms of what you can and cannot do as a man (at least in the West, anyway). But there comes a time when a man`s emotions do get the better of him, and they pour forth - as prerequisite an impassioned speech may or may not be present - by cascading down his cheeks. These are what we like to call "manly tears". Extremely powerful. Not limited but often used in hot-blooded / super robot shows. Examples include Yuusha Ou GaoGaiGar, Getter Robo and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.
The opposite of manly tears are "girly tears".</description>

<name>space opera</name>
<description>Space opera is a sub-genre of fiction that emphasizes romantic adventures in space. Space opera generally involves large-scale conflicts between opponents with powerful abilities and technology. The genre will often be melodramatic, sometimes playing music that can be nothing short of awesome. Warfare and a battle of wits are usually less emphasized, preferring romance (with exceptions, e.g. Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu). Some space operas tend to be formulaic and sometimes even prosaic, often employing very simple devices and somewhat obvious strategies. An example of this would be the infamous laws of physics in the Macross universe, in which the main male lead will hardly ever get hit in battle.</description>

<name>Engrish</name>
<description>Engrish is actually a mispronunciation of English, as can be the result of someone, who does not have English as their primary language of origin (such as Japanese or Chinese). Occasionally characters in the original Japanese dialogue version of an anime will speak in English... however; this often still requires the assistance of subtitles, for while the words are meant to be said in English, the sentence structure and letter pronunciation may still be strongly related to the person’s primary language.</description>

<name>Nono</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Hailing from a rural community in the Martian countryside, Nono is a simple and clumsy girl with a big dream: she wants to be a space pilot. And not just any space pilot, but one to rival "Nonoriri". Of course, dreaming of being a pilot and actually becoming one are two entirely different things, as she soon finds out upon reaching the city. Even after landing a somewhat dead-end job as a waitress in one of the city`s bars, Nono stubbornly holds on to her ideals, despite the chiding of her boss and the bar`s regular patrons. Her persistence pays off, however, when she encounters a real space pilot in the person of Lal`C Melk Mark, member of the elite Fraternity and current pilot of Buster Machine Dix-Neuf. It is through Lal`C (whom she impulsively dubs her onee-sama, or big sister) that Nono finally finds the means to make her dreams a reality.
Possessing a bubbly personality and a near-endless supply of optimism, Nono seems to be a normal, if clumsy, country girl. However, Nono is anything but normal; in fact, she isn`t even human, but an android, who can`t quite remember the reason why she was built (though much of her past is revealed later in the series). She idolizes Lal`C, despite the fact that the latter seems to regard her with mild annoyance, and will do anything to please her.
Nono has trace recorded history of http://anidb.net/ch1836 [Takaya Noriko] and http://anidb.net/ch1837 [Amano Kazumi] (The pilots of Buster Machines 1 and 2) in her memory. The very person she Idolizes and wants to become is Takaya Noriko. Due to her damaged memory, Nono cannot remember Noriko`s actual name and thus pronounces it Nonoriri.</description>

<name>Buster Machine 7 Gou</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Though alluded to throughout the series, it is revealed that Nono is in fact a buster machine.
Nono herself is formidable, with the ability to warp almost instantaneously using the singularity built into her. Using three special lenses on the back of her hands and her chest, she can absorb energy blasts. Upon her legs are six banks of lasers similar to the ones used on the old Exelion, as well as additional thrusters. Finally, she can fire off a Buster Beam, or her rendition of a slicing maneuver, where she has the power to cut a moon in half. Not to mention the ability to create multitudes of micro-black holes. However, her greatest ability is to control what is referred to in this series as "Space Monsters", which are actually the Buster Corps support unit built to protect the solar system from the true Space Monsters. The greatest show of this is when the entirety of the collective Buster Corps patrolling and encircling the Solar System is assembled, creating the largest Buster Machine combination to date, "Diebuster". It`s a gigantic red-colored rendition of Nono, though the outfit bears a close resemblance to the legacy Top Squadron uniforms from Gunbuster. Assembled, it is comparable in size to Earth. In this form, Nono resides in the large crest upon the machine`s forehead, which resembles the insignia of the space fleet from Gunbuster.</description>

<name>Lal`C Mellk Mal</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The current holder of the top kill score among Topless pilots, Lal`C, along with fellow pilots Nicola and Tycho, is part of the so-called "Idol" group (pilots with exceptionally high kill rates). She is also the current pilot of Buster Machine Dix-Neuf, the oldest buster machine still in operation. Nicknamed "princess" ("hime") by her teammates, Lal`C is outwardly cool and self-confident - traits that draw Nono`s admiration for her, much to her initial annoyance. It is Lal`C who helps induct Nono (with some indirect assistance from Nicola) into the Fraternity as an "auxiliary member", despite the fact that Nono manifests none of the traits associated with being a Topless.
While initially bothered by Nono`s hero-worship of her, Lal`C gradually gets used to her company, to the point where she can talk about things she wouldn`t normally tell anyone. She senses some potential in Nono, and admires the girl`s never-give-up attitude a little (though she might act otherwise), but doubts if guts and perseverance alone can make the girl`s dreams come true.</description>

<name>Dix-Neuf</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>The oldest Buster Machine still in active service, its name literally means "nineteen" in French. Its appearance resembles a stereotypical Japanese bike gangster (bosozoku; sporting a long dark trenchcoat covering its muscular-looking body with baggy matching "pants". It has a huge red scar running through its chest and abdomen, and an artificial metal left arm. Dix-Neuf has a cruise mode wherein it resembles a huge space rocket. Its wide array of weaponry includes finger-mounted machineguns, the Buster Gator (a hand-held chainsaw/knuckle weapon augmented by the right forearm rockets), Buster Beam, Buster Might (missiles located in its left forearm), and Burning Wall (micro-missiles stored in the inner layer of its coat) to name a few. When its coat is removed, a huge bronze oni (Japanese demon) face with red eyes and flaming horns is revealed on its back which is capable of offense using eyebeams. When detached, its coat can also transform into a large laser cannon. It also has the ability to teleport to where Lal`C summons it to be when the Topless seal on her forehead is removed.
While capable of battling opponents without a pilot (due to its accumulative AI), Dix-Neuf`s true potential is unleashed when a Topless pilots it: its mobility increases exponentially, its otherwise rigid trench coat is able to flex and move almost as if it weighed little more than a piece of clothing, and it can use weaponry powered by its Topless pilot`s Exotic Maneuvers.
Dix-Neuf had its Degeneracy generator removed and replaced with a cockpit in the chest. This may have been done to bury the technology to keep humans in the solar system, or simply because of the horn going through its right eye, blocking access to the original cockpit located in its head. In its true form, after Lal`C and Dix-Neuf violently installed a Degeneracy generator from one of the fallen Buster Corps "space monster" into itself, the entire machine turns red, with the heavy overcoat turned into pure energy. The large mouthpiece is removed, exposing a human face.
Dix-Neuf saves Lal`C one last time when Nono warps the black hole away from earth, its presumably sealed off with the other buster machines as there are no more threats from Space Monsters.</description>

<name>Nicola Vacheron</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The only male Topless on the "Idol" team, Nicola is the pilot of Buster Machine Vingt-Sept and, before Lal`C`s inclusion into the ranks of the Topless, was considered one of the most powerful Topless of his generation. He is Lal`C`s inspiration (in as much as Lal`C is Nono`s inspiration), and seems to have a relationship with her, though it is debatable whether it is of a romantic nature or not. He is interested in Nono and sees potential in her to be a Buster Machine pilot, despite the fact that Nono has never manifested any kind of Topless reaction (something that, according to their minder Casio, may not be possible in artificial beings), and secretly helps Nono join the Fraternity under the premise of being an "auxiliary" member.
Considered "old" among the current Topless (as he is nearing late adolescence), Nicola is already having a hard time manifesting the Exotic Maneuvers needed to power his machine. As such, he seems to secretly be seeking a way to extend his "tenure" as a Topless, to the point of joining the Serpentine Twin`s inner circle and acting as their watcher over Nono`s activities.
He ultimately loses his ability to pilot the Buster machine and becomes a lieutenant in the empire.</description>

<name>Vingt-Sept</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>Vingt-Sept is a somewhat gangly-looking machine sporting outstretched wings which can be used as a secondary pair of arms at its shoulders that house a multitude of speaker-like openings on its surface, which likely help magnify the range and effect of the reality-bending Exotic Maneuvers Nicola uses. It has the ability to create reality distortions which it can use to manipulate objects around it and use them as offensive weapons, other than that it has two swords for slicing through the enemy. Designed primarily for quick movement and melee combat, Vingt-Sept is light on ranged attacks, relying instead on remote-detonated "mines", as evidenced in the battle against the Jupiter Express. Its name means "twenty-seven" in French.</description>

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>Tycho`s final Buster Machine, Quatre-Vingt-Dix is the newest model to be rolled out of the factories in more than a decade. Slim and feminine in appearance (even sporting a pink and white paint job), Quatre-Vingt-Dix seems to be designed as a long-ranged support unit, as most of the attacks it displays in the series seemed to be ranged (as well as affecting wide areas) in nature. It is famous for its Buster Smash, a tennis-inspired wide-area attack capable of freezing large numbers of opponents instantaneously. Its name means "ninety" in French.</description>

<name>Tycho Science</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The final member of the "Idol" team, Tycho is brash, impulsive, and utterly determined (at least in the beginning) to best Lal`C`s longstanding kill record, seeing it as a chance to wipe the normally smug look off the face of the teacher`s pet (another of Lal`C`s nicknames among the members of the Fraternity). She has a low opinion of Topless in general (despite the fact that she`s a Topless herself) due to an event in her childhood where - in spite of her powers - she was unable to cure the illness of a close friend, and is annoyed by Nono`s constant attempts to prove herself worthy to become a Buster Machine pilot. Ironically, it is Nono who later helps her change her way of thinking for the better. While it isn`t outwardly implied, the two become friends, though not on the same level as Nono and Lal`C.</description>

<name>Casio Takashirou</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The only adult member of the "Idol" team, Casio is their guardian, technician, and confidant rolled into one. A former Topless himself (he was a pilot of Dix-Neuf before Lal`C joined the Fraternity), Casio possesses an intimate understanding of the workings of the Buster Machines, as well as the people forced to pilot them. That is part of why he was one of the first to express his doubts on Nicola`s assertion that Nono had the potential to become a pilot. Despite his initial misgivings, however, he joins Lal`C in welcoming Nono into their "team".
Despite being a lech and a joker, Casio can be surprisingly serious when the situation merits it. He secretly yearns to pilot a Buster Machine again, but is resigned to the fact that he can only be near them, due to his advanced age. He is aware of the shady activities of the Serpentine Twins, but not the exact details of their little "project". Casio`s fate at the end of the series is unknown, but presumably remains an engineer in the empire.</description>
