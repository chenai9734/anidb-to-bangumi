<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="150768">I`ll just say:

One Piece ≠ Fairy Tail</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="502713">15 years ago i would have loved this, and it was still good enough for me to watch the first 75 episodes, but at the end of most of them i felt like i was wasting my time, this is aimed at the 10-15yo crowd from what i can tell, so i recommend it to them, but not to a veteran like me with over 700 anime titles under my belt.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="639219">I just LOVE Fairy Tail. It has SO much in it (some characters are wonderfully endearing and others are terribly annoying, some are young and others are old -- but all of them are needed to make a good tale). It takes a while for the various elements to fully blossom and come to fruition. Fairy Tail has not only many creative forms of magic and awesome combat, but it also speaks to the human condition and overflows with moments of heartfelt joy (for those who can be so moved)!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="251364">it has one piece style Great anime incoming!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="364026">Good anime, nice characters. Even for people who don`t like One Piece it`s a great Anime. Hooked from episode one and finally a good serie about magic. not to mention the great music.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="324464">if u like one piece, naruto then u must watch this. Adventure anime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="379253">This is a great anime. Everyone who watch Bleach, Naruto and One Piece can`t miss Fairy Tail.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="339854">Something funny always happens in the show. Must Watch!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="20063">Humor, action, good animations. Without doubt a really good shounen anime out there.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="85643">Some of the descriptions mention `poor animation`, but they`re flat-out wrong. The animation style is just different, and I`d say not only is it wonderful, but it matches the series incredibly well. A must-see^^</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="270767">Always funny and interesting story. Although the animation could be better.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="124124">worth watching, kept me greatly entertained.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="724513">Compared to other similar shows you get a good sense of adventure. There`s a lot of fun mystery and magic. Fights aren`t as good as, let`s say Naruto or Bleach... but... At the core it`s a parody, so the tone is not as serious and the comedy is top-notch!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="284604">A very long time coming, this anime is one a few that contains vibrant characters, over the top action and very comedic undertones. You even feel something for the anti-heroes just to find out that they are relatable with their own stories that only makes you look forward to each oncoming nemesis.

Looking forward to the next season.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="13457">Great Manga, idd one of the best presently! compelling story, great action, funny characters...great entertainment. can´t wait to see the anime adaptation :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="251471">Best manga in a while, easily on class with Bleach and Naruto if you like those 2 you will like Fairy Tail</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="50199">Funny show with a captivating story. Similar to One piece with a soul of its own!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="419645">This is an awesome anime, it might not look so good on the site but its really worth looking in HD and not in stream, if u really want to enjoy it. the chars are made 4 their role and u never is bored by anything allways new fun and exitement</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="171493">It`s not so good as ppl describe it. I would enjoy it more if it weren`t so childish, but it`s still okay too watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="429843">Its pretty good anime so i liked it alot</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="386163">An epic magic anime..:)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="446359">prolly one of the most easy watching, dragon ball style anime ever.

One piece batles are boring and naruto is just unberable, 30 episodes per fight...

Comedy, imagination and great soundtrack 10/10</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="326975">Recommended for every shounen fan. Even if the first episodes seem generic, it gets better as the story progresses. It`s not one of the most popular shounen series in Japan for nothing after all.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="330647">I watched Fairy Tail week by week as it was coming out, and even at its worst it managed to keep me watching; at its best it was excellent laughs, very enjoyable fight scenes, and an awesome series in general. Well recommended!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="431902">Fairy Tail is an excellent anime, one of my greatest recent finds. Interesting plot, great comedy, breathtaking music and fantastic characters make for an all-around awesome experience. Unfortunately, some things prevent Fairy Tail from achieving true greatness: 1 - It can be too kid-friendly. (Almost) no blood at all and many of the arcs end with nearly everyone becoming friends (or at least no hard feelings). 2 - It makes use of some cliché plot devices (time-travel, alternate dimensions...). 3 - It can sometimes have great plot ideas only to have them ruined quite a few episodes later. Still, it is very enjoyable and I can recommend it to just about anyone. Oh, and beware the MASSIVE amount of fanservice!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="237936">better ever seen since One Piece. I recommend for all people who like magic, fantastic style. Great animation and the music style like metal folk are awesome in the combat. Super story line.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="538195">Not only is it for shounen fans but it would make anyone count seconds for new eps...just saying..</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="384304">Watching Fairy Tail you`ll come as close to that One Piece magic possible. It may be inspired by "the big 3" but the story in itself is really solid. Really love this.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="560352">Only anime to this day that has brought tears to my eyes. Incredible characters, action, and surprisingly, music.

The music is like Square Enix, Dropkick Murphys, and the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra had a love child. Absolute must watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="386712">Best anime airing atm : comedy, action, nice soundtracks, girls with big cleavage !</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="559673">Epic fights , awesome music, good comedy, nice plot and fantastic and unique characters. the only blant spot is the missing element of gore.I believe every fighiting anime must have blood , nonotheless this is definitely a must see!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="359275">really good show</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="593070">Epic fights , awesome Story &amp; music , definitely  MUST SEE</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="230154">I am a huge fan of magic themed animes and i watched pretty of them. But fairy tail is different. You don`t only watch fantasy but also comedy, sadness, friendship, action etc.  Characters are well developed. Every arc suppresses the previous ones and have connections each other in some ways. Realizing these makes you "whoa!". In short, watching this anime is MUST SEE ;)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="159752">Fairy Tail....amazing. and manga are usually better than anime..but these fights in anime are on different level from the manga. watch it. you won`t regret it. after all, It`s one of the best anime around so far. VERY EPIC!

    P.S.

    agreed with phoenixxl

    i mean bleach and naruto take like 40 to 50 episodes to just finish one or two fights after all...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="570845">I`m sorry, but I really like this anime a lot! Lucy is a great master and everyone here is so kind!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="412128">superb</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="400668">THIS IS AWESOME EVRYTHING YOU WANT IS HERE

if you like One Piece then this is for you 

again who doesn`t like One Piece :P</recommendation>

<name>maid</name>
<description>A maid is a female employed in domestic service. They usually wear uniforms. Since their nature is to be obedient and serve their goshujin-sama (master), they are one of the most desired types of women in Japan, a dream of every Japanese man, particularly http://anidb.net/t1133 [otaku]. Often seen in so-called Maid Cafes in Akihabara, where male customers can for a little time enjoy the feeling of being served by a woman. The male gender opposite is the butler.</description>

<description>Very intelligent mythical beings - a cross between a very large lizard and a dinosaur - that breath fire, and have a knack for kidnapping damsels, thus distressing them. In Fantasy anime this perceptive species often lives secluded from human civilisation, protectors of long lost knowledge. Dragons seem to be on the verge of extinction.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<tag id="2606" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2018-11-05">
<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<tag id="2607" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2009-04-29">
<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<tag id="2608" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2012-12-04">
<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>large breasts</name>
<description>Large breasts are breasts a fair notch larger than average, as found in some adolescent girls or fully grown women; however, as anime has no upper limit to breast size, the definition applies somewhat differently. To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>

<name>magic circles</name>
<description>A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised.
Traditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for non-magical work such as meditation.
Generally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names.

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

<description>Somewhere down the line, it became the "norm" that boys don`t cry.

But there comes a time when a man`s emotions do get the better of him, and they pour forth - as prerequisite an impassioned speech may or may not be present - by cascading down his cheeks. These are what we like to call "manly tears". Extremely powerful. Not limited but often used in hot-blooded / super robot shows. Examples include Yuusha Ou GaoGaiGar, Getter Robo and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<name>Lucy Heartfilia</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Lucy Heartfilia is the main female protagonist and viewpoint character of Fairy Tail.
According to http://anidb.net/cr7578 [Mashima Hiro], her given name was inspired by The Beatles song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds".
She is a 17-year-old wizard who specializes in summoning celestial spirits from another realm using a set of keys called Gatekeys, and treats them like her friends. She also carries a whip as her personal weapon, which she wields on occasion to fight alongside her spirits.
As one of the saner members of the guild, Lucy regularly gawks at the odd habits of her guildmates, who frequently show up uninvited inside her house.

<name>Natsu Dragneel</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Natsu Dragneel, also known by the nickname "Salamander" (火竜), is the main male protagonist of Fairy Tail.
Aside from performing missions for his guild, Natsu travels with his partner http://anidb.net/ch11802 [Happy] in search of Igneel, a dragon who raised Natsu in his youth before disappearing seven years prior to the start of the series.
He is a Dragon Slayer (滅竜魔導士), a wizard who can perform an ancient form of magic, or "Lost Magic", that grants him the physical properties of a dragon. He specializes in a particular form of this magic called Fire Dragon Slayer magic (火の滅竜魔法), which gives him powers such as breathing fire, emitting flames from any part of his body to attack his opponent, being physically immune to fire, and ingesting any flame besides his own for nourishment.
Natsu is generally carefree and reckless in nature, and causes most of the collateral damage Fairy Tail is blamed for. However, he is extremely loyal to his guildmates and attacks anyone who tries to harm or insult them. Although he comes across as thick-headed to several other characters, he is a perceptive tactician in battle and can quickly deduce his opponents` strengths and weaknesses.
He suffers from motion sickness when riding on vehicles of any sort (trains, carriages, boats, etc.), as well as when carried by others. The only exception to this rule is Happy, who Natsu claims is his friend and not a "moving object".

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Happy is a 6-year-old talking cat with blue fur who serves as Natsu`s best friend and initial partner before Lucy`s inclusion in the Fairy Tail guild.
http://anidb.net/cr7578 [Mashima Hiro] originally planned to name him "Freyr" after the Norse god, but found the name did not fit his character.
Happy possesses a magical ability called Aera (翼), which allows him to temporarily grow white feathered wings on his back and fly. He is only able to carry up to one person at a time in this form.
He is generally cheerful as per his name, and often utters the catchphrase "Aye!" (あい) or "Aye, sir!" (あいさ).

<description>Gray Fullbuster is one of the main male protagonists. He is an 18-year-old wizard who uses a form of magic called Ice Make (氷の造形魔法), which allows him to instantaneously create ice and mold it into various kinds of weapons, shields, and other inanimate objects.
He has a habit of stripping down to his underwear, often without realizing it, which he developed as a result of his training to withstand the freezing temperatures.
While normally calm and collected, Gray has a fierce rivalry with http://anidb.net/ch11801 [Natsu] due to their opposing magic types, which constantly leads the two to bicker and insult each other.

<description>Plue`s body is a pure white creature with a yellow horn-like nose. It`s always trembling, and it can only say "puun". Its favorite food is candy. When it`s hungry or enters a bath, its body and nose become shrivelled. Hiro Mashima, the author of the manga, has said that Plue feels close to a stuffed animal. It`s age and gender are a mystery.
In Groove Adventure Rave, Plue is a strange creature that Haru discovered, Plue is the Rave Bearer, and is able to sense the presence of the other Rave Stones. Plue`s nose also has the ability to destroy Dark Bring. It has the ability to utilise the Rave of Combat, which powers itself and Haru up.
In Fairy Tail, Plue is a Silver Key Celestial Spirit officially called "Nicola the Canis Minor", but named Plue by its summoner Lucy. Its only unique ability is magic cancellation, and so serves more as a pet for Lucy.</description>

<description>Ul is a very powerful ice mage that trained both Leon and Gray. While Ul and her first apprentice Leon were walking through a town where the evil demon Deliora had just rampaged they found one lone survivor who happened to be Gray. From that day on Ul had trained both the boys to become ice mages and even began seeing them as her own two sons.
It was later revealed that Ultear is Ul`s daughter and Sieglein commented that if Ul was alive, she would most likely be one of the Ten Holy Mages.
Ul died in a battle with Deliora that was caused by Gray. He had run away from Ul and challenged Deliora himself. That forced Ul to use Iced Shell to freeze her opponent forever, freezing herself in the process.</description>

<name>Lisanna Strauss</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Lisanna was the younger sister of both Elfman and Mirajane, and was also a member of Fairy Tail, like her siblings her magic is take over. Her member stamp was on her upper left shoulder.
It is also very possible that Lisanna, Elfman and Mirajane operated in a three man group similar to Shadow Gear. She lost her life while trying to revert Elfman after his full-body Take Over went awry. He quickly lost control of himself and went on a rampage. Lisana gave her life trying to calm him down and stop his rampage (actually she didnt die, but was transported to Edolas). How she actually was able to do this is unknown. The mental and emotional trauma that Elfman and Mirajane both experienced after Lisana`s supposed death crippled their powers considerably. Mirajane lost her S-class rank and has not fought since. Elfman suffered major emotional damage and was incapable to cast his full body takeover spell for some time. When he did try casting it, a flashback to Lisana caused him to lose concentration. When Lisanna was younger, she seemed to be very kind like Elfman and unlike Mirajane. She wanted to help Natsu Dragneel raise an unknown egg to see what comes out of it, being a little more knowledgable in it then Natsu. After seeing a softer side of the usually flamboyant Natsu, she stated that he was a lot like her sister and joked that perhaps later she should become his bride which predictably freaked him out. It is shown that while the Edolas version of Lisanna is deceased, the Eathland version of Lisanna is still alive. Like her Earth land counterpart, she seems just as friendly and caring, as seen when she scolds Lucy for bullying Natsu and tells Jet and Droy not to pick on Elfman. When Natsu and Happy see her they both shed tears and tried to hug her in joy, this freaked her out. She doesn`t seem to have the massive crush her Earth Realm counterpart has on Natsu.</description>

After Deliora is discovered to be long dead, Zalty is revealed to be Ultear, the daughter of Ur. Unsuccessful in the attempt to gain Deliora, Ultear later helps Siegrain manipulate the Magic Council in order to activate the Tower of Paradise.</description>

<description>Erigor was the leader of the former Eisenwald Guild; he became known as a "Shinigami" as he became a mage that only accepted assassination jobs. His weapon of choice is a scythe.
Eligor ordered his guild members to secure Lullaby, a magic death flute, so he could kill all the Guild Masters during their meeting. Kageyama returned with the flute as Erigor took over a train and after punishing Kageyama for alerting Flies of their plans. As Team Natsu found their way to Eligor, Eligor left and had his guild deal with them while he prepared a Wind Wall to trap them in the train station. He had almost casted it as Erza Scarlet challenged him. Eligor surprisingly trapped her before the fight could be begin.
Natsu defeats Eligor
After resting awhile, Eligor headed towards the guild masters however he was stopped by Natsu Dragneel who was riding Happy. As the two began a battle of fire and wind, Eligor casted his Storm Mail spell which canceled all fire magic. As Natsu refused to be beaten (and got angrier), Eligor`s storm mail wore off as Natsu`s angry made his flames hotter as fire sucks up oxygen causing Erigor`s wind magic to weaken. After Happy told Natsu to give up and let Gray Fullbuster take care of him, Natsu went into a mad rage and defeated Eligor.
According to police reports, Eligor escaped from being arrested (unlike his other guild mates) and hasn`t been seen since.</description>

<description>Juvia made up 1/4th of the Phantom Lord`s elite group, Element 4. She was sent by the guild master Jose, along with Sol, to go and capture Lucy and bring her back to him safely. Her magic seems to deal with water as she is able to control rain and other large bodies of water. In addition, her body seems to be formed from the rain that surrounds her, leaving her intact and able to reform herself after attacks. Her nickname is also Juvia of the Sea, which correlates with her water controlling magic. When angry she can also control hot water. Juvia also often refers to herself in the 3rd person. Juvia has developed a crush on Gray, and due to a misunderstanding, views Lucy as her rival in love. After being defeated by Gray, the rain above her finally clears up which she thought was beautiful.
After the fight, her deep infatuation with Gray continues, secretly following him wherever he goes. In the current arc, she mentions to Gray that she is now an independent mage once more, but Gray notes that she has probably has her eyes set on Fairy Tail. She is quite willing to do anything for him.
She is one of the few Phantom members to be shown after the Phantom Guild arc. The Spanish word "lluvia", which is pronounced like her name, means rain.</description>

<description>The Phantom Lord Guild was a long time rival of the Fairy Tail Guild. Phantom Lord vandalized the Fairy Tail main building, and the attack was led by the second strongest mage of the guild, Gajeel. The two guilds have had many brushes in the past, but this was the first time Phantom Lord attacked them directly. Phantom Lord also has a S-class group called the Element 4, which are similar to the four S-class mages of Fairy Tail: Erza Scarlet, Laxus Dreyar, Mystogan, and Gildarts Clive. Their guild building has six mechanical legs which allow the building to get up and move around. The guild building is also equipped with a magical convergent cannon called Jupiter. The building can also transform into a giant machine known as Super Mage Giant Phantom MK II. When it`s transformed into the Giant Phantom it acts just as a giant mage that can use spells, including forbidden ones.</description>

<description>Vidaldus Taka is a mage who is part of Trinity Raven, a group working under Jellal that belong to the assassins guild called the Death`s Head Caucus. Vidaldus` appearance is that of a rock star who always seems to be swinging his hair around wildly. He ran into Lucy Heartfilia and Juvia Loxar as they were searching for Natsu Dragneel. Lucy hid while Juvia was unaffected by his attacks. However, her attacks didn`t work on him either as his hair can soak up water. He then used his Rock of Succubus magic to take control of Juvia and attacked Lucy. Lucy was at a disadvantage for most of the fight but Juvia managed to talk to Lucy subconsciously through the water. Together with Lucy`s Celestial Spirit Aquarius they used an attack called Unison Raid against Vidaldus knocking him out, as well as wiping all of the hair clean off of his head.</description>

Her appearance is roughly that of a geisha though her power are more in line with that of a samurai. She confronted Shou as he tried to escape from the Tower of Paradise with Erza (who was in card form at the moment) and attacked them out of nowhere. Luckily her attacks distorted the power around the card holding Erza, allowing Erza to escape and confront Ikaruga. Erza used all type of her armors against her but each was cut to pieces by Ikaruga`s blade. Eventually Erza was only down to a pair of pants around her waist and cloth around her upper body. Ikaruga thought of it as an easy win, and the two attacked one another. However much to her surprise Erza was able to deal a mortal blow and defeats her.</description>

Fukuro`s appearance is one of the most bizarre seen so far in series, having the body of a man but the head of an owl as well as have rockets strapped to his back. He also fancies himself a warrior of justice despite the fact he working for the antagonist. He confronts Natsu Dragneel in the Paradise Tower as the fire mage makes his way up to confront Jellal. The two are evenly matched in terms of fighting skill but Fukuro manages to catch Natsu off guard and eat him, absorbing his fire magic. Gray Fullbuster happens upon the scene shortly after and becomes Fukuro`s next opponent. While the owl mage manages to use Natsu`s power against Gray, its nowhere near powerful enough to beat him. Fukuro then opts to eat Gray instead but find he too cold to swallow allowing Gray to finish him off with his ice magic, causing Fukuro to spit out Natsu in the process.</description>

<description>The dark guild Eisenwald was a guild that specialized in assassinations. Because the Magic Council prohibits mages from taking assassination requests, the guild was ousted from the Mage Guild League six years ago, and became categorized as a Dark Guild. After a failed plot to assassinate the guild masters, they were all put in jail. It was later revealed at the beginning of the Oracion Seis arc that Eisenwald was actually one of the subordinate guilds to Oracion Seis.</description>

<summary>Zeref reveals to Hades that his power had never been sealed to begin with, making Grimoire Heart`s efforts to reawaken him pointless. Accusing Hades of summoning the dragon called Acnologia through his guild`s actions, Zeref kills him. Ultear, meanwhile, confesses to Meredy about destroying her hometown and tries to drown herself out of guilt, but Meredy rescues and forgives her. On Tenrou Island, Makarov postpones the S-Class exam because of the battle, and Cana finally tells Gildarts that she is his daughter. As this happens, Acnologia forebodingly flies towards Tenrou Island as Zeref watches in alarm.</summary>
