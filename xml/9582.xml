<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="270473">It`s very nice. I cried and laugh a lot.

Muito bom. Chorei e ri muito.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="398648">Sometimes you laugh because it`s funny or you feel bad for the main character.
Besides that I was expecting something more enjoyable and funny. But it has some good parts (very few, but has).</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="103542">Interesting premise but it doesn`t really go anywhere. The humour may be hit or miss with some people and I think it`s the kind of show that`s more enjoyable if you can relate with the main character.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="572453">Nice comedy, but was expecting a lot more from it tho. It lacks a lot when it comes to character development. Also there are many references to other series, so people unfamiliar with them might not get all the jokes.
I still haven`t read the manga, hope it`ll be better.
Still this anime is a strong choice for people who like comedies.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="403846">Good watch. The great comedy is something i really appreciate as they dont come out that often. I wish that it had better character development, though.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="549003">its in no way bullying as some suggest.only bullying is by the nature and society itself .. peer pressure... but it is a wonder ful satire dark comedy ..... sad and innocent in a devilish way .. almost like ore ga iru a different shade of it ...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="279092">If this is a comedy, “King Lear” is a travelogue.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="255810">Until today I didn`t think there could be decent anime based just around one character. But this one is great! Tomoko is really endearing character, with great variety of expressions and emotions. She makes you both laugh and feel awkward with her at the same time and you get attached before you realize it. Really recommend it, we need more anime like this. =)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="449946">I just watch it - from 1st epizode to last! - and... I LOVED IT!
You must see it! It`s an unique anime in this `boring-uniformed-fanservice-ecchi-male-harem-style` anime world!
The protagonist`s seiyuu is awesome!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="73198">Fantastic anime for current or former misanthropes, introverts, social outcasts, people who had a rough time in high school, awkward people, etc.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="376567">This show really scraped the surface of some major problems in many societys. It had much to say to the viewer because of it`s realism, and that`s why Tomoko was so easy to relate to. If you liked Welcome to NHK, you will probably like this one too, altough it`s much smaller series in many ways. I liked the playfulness of this series in animation and music.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="597854">I read the manga on this anime about 2 years ago so when i saw the anime on here i was very surprised and excited because i really enjoyed the manga and so i felt the anime would be equally good.
Just as i expected the anime is good, although they piece out certain parts of the manga to make it as funny as possible i don`t seem to mind that to much and i doubt you will either.
Overall its a great anime especially for those who have seen many amines on the whole guys who are losers that are constantly trying to get girls to like them, this anime is a VERY nice change of pace because now its the other way around and i couldn`t have been more entertained.

I highly recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a good laugh, you wont be disappointed.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="596323">Pretty much funny and easy to watch.
If u found this setting stressful or embarrassing - check your life, may be u have too much in common with Kuroki ^_~</recommendation>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<description>The antics of the protagonists do not take place in some exotic setting or time, but in everyday life. When not "at the job" this means getting up in the morning, making meals, house cleaning, going shopping or out to eat, visiting the bath house or spa, leisure activities in the spare time, etc. The time "on the job" for students is School Life, for others working in their profession.

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<name>eating Pocky</name>
<description>Pocky (ポッキー) is a Japanese snack food produced by the Ezaki Glico Company of Japan. Pocky was first sold in 1966, and consists of a biscuit stick coated with chocolate. It was named after the Japanese onomatopoetic word for the sound Pocky makes when bitten, pokkin (ポッキン). The original was followed by "Almond Pocky" in 1971, with an almond coating, and "Strawberry Pocky" in 1977. Today, the product line includes such variations as milk, mousse, green tea, honey, banana and coconut flavored coatings, and themed products such as "Decorer Pocky," with colourful decorative stripes in the coating, and "Men`s Pocky," a dark (bittersweet) chocolate and "mature" version.

It`s marketed in Germany under the name Mikado (Note: NOT the game, the snack).</description>

<name>sibling yin yang</name>
<description>In real life, siblings hardly ever act the same. Fiction sometimes takes this to an extreme.
Enter Sibling Yin Yang, the occurrence of siblings that are nearly polar opposites. If he`s cool and reckless, she`s responsible and thoughtful. If she`s a spiky-haired hooligan, he`s the nerdy wimpy one. If he`s an immature brat, she`s... well, you get the picture.</description>

As other kids in her class laugh over photos from their recent karaoke outing, Tomoko sits alone reading a book while she eats her lunch. That`s when she decides it`s time to take action so she can learn to converse with others - especially boys.
