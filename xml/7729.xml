<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="96822">Just me, Desire + ever17 = Steinsgate.

ps: gets better after ep 12.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="314849">The show is ok, full of tropes, cliches, and flat characters in a disguise harem setting but if you haven`t seen much and can`t recognize these, then yeah it`s a good show.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="436748">this anime took about 10 episodes to reach me, i really couldn`t understand all the fuss about it until then. now i`m addicted and it`s so awesome, thrilling and original! be patient unitl you reach ep 10 and above to see its full potential, you won`t regret it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="455194">If you understand a little about this computer stuff the hacking part is just a big *facepalm* (thats what i hate about cyberpunk)
I think it also applies to physicists and the LHC stuff.
But overall it was nice to watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="555738">Seems silly in the beginning, but give it time and it will grow in every way</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="611299">best story</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="632413">Epic Sci-Fi Anime. Recommended for you..</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="57112">Overrated anime. It starts out quite interesting, but quickly develops into a mundane "repeat the same day over again" story kind of like the movie Run Lola Run. Most of the characters are stereotypes: the tsundere love interest, the moe childhood friend, the overweight otaku/hacker, the shy androgynous character, the overly cute "nyan nyan" character, etc. However, the main character is good, there is above average character development, and for the most part the show is entertaining. However, it had so much more potential than what it became.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="481253">Usually, I don`t like too many jokes, but the balance of humor and seriousness is well put here. Inteligent sci-fi and great plot until now, without mention the excentric Okabe, that will pull out many laughters for sure. All will depend on how they will develop the story from now on, but until now, I recommend you to watch this.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="479971">When I saw the first episode, i thought it will be a bad sci-fi show, but after some time, it started to be a great comedy :) I highly reccomend this :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="77420">A pretty good anime with 2 distinct phases which are separated at the middle (12 episodes more or less). This could be a great one if not for the stereotypical characterization often found in anime. Still, very worth a watch and I`d recommend watching the first episode again after seeing the whole series just to check how everything connects just right.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="381652">It has a rough start but once you get deep into it you know what to expect from the following episodes. There is some comic relief spread into various episodes to relieve some of the tension in a rather serious setting. While not flawless(I`ve noticed various mistakes with one of them being from the animation studio`s/director`s side, not being able to fully express the seiyuu`s depth of the protagonist`s character, Okabe Rintarou) it is certainly worth a watch for the other serious subjects it touches(even if just a little) such as homosexuality and to what great lengths people would go to attain a sense of belonging. 

A very mature and happy ending as a truly fitting conclusion. 
Recommended.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="515855">Totally marvelous design and psychology of characters. Tut-tu-roo!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="672632">Incredible anime adaptation of the visual novel.
Soundtrack is very good and the characters are interesting.
It`s a very sad anime, I think almost every named character cries at least once.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="428654">EP 1-11 was kinda slow and boring, imo. 

Very good anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="84998">Not bad, but not the best either. Takes a while to really get going, and the last 4 or 5 episodes will drive you crazy if you don`t have a lot of patience for filler scenes and filler dialogue that do nothing to drive the plot. It`s worth the time to watch it, at the very least. If you consider yourself an anime connoisseur, you should probably watch it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="36">Odd cast but the story is incredibly interesting in terms of plot. While the story moves slowly at times, the show doesn`t get quite boring and the plot still manages to keep your attention.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="177218">I have to agree! It`s one hella interesting mystery sci-fi series. Kept me glued to my seat on wanting to know what happen next &amp; next etc etc :) Satisfying ending too!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="427701">Pretty good anime IMO. Good mix of plot, storyline, and drama. If you`re watching this you should probably note that it does start a little bit slow and confusing so hang in there until episode 7. I didn`t understand everything about time travel in there but you really don`t need to to appreciate it. Does have a bit of melancholy but it`s not that bad. Really liked it!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="332605">As far as Time Travel story goes, this one works. The story is well constructed: it builds up nicely and it`s ending with satisfactory closure.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="366429">Great and dark story about time traveling. The anime is well-made and not just something for fans of the game. Definitely recommended!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="200790">best to be seen on your IBN PC in HD monocrome.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="337356">The phrase in my mind: "post-haruhi". The series holds together quite well, at times funny, at times drama, at times soft sci-fi, rather calmly paced. Nothing that could bend your mind, but still enjoyable. At times too much of a forced certain-community-targetted jokes, but hey, let`s just ignore them [jokes].</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="76759">Definitely worth the watch if you`re into well-plotted suspense.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="471928">it was simply awesome i think it was one of the best anime of this season</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="228848">Watch this show damn you! Watch it! Get through the first 5-6 episodes but stick through it. Watch it until the very last second of episode 24. What the HELL are you doing still reading this! GO! WATCH IT! NOW!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="522273">This might sound like a broken record but its the best take on time travel EVER!!! And most of the science makes sense. Has everything to make it a 9 point anime. From comedy to light romance and at times serious. Best anime of 2011. Must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="230513">Brilliant show! a "must see" for people who like a great developing story with a awesome climax!

Dp</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="291172">It`s all in there.Food for thought,sci-fi,ever increasing suspense,good comedy sometimes(not mainly comedy) and a tidbit of quality romance.Grade A++ stuff, in a time where most new series go for same ol` boring ,market tested stuff like ecchi or mindless shounen brawling.Must watch even if you`re not into sci-fi.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="262593">Propably one of the best stories out there, one of those where you have to watch the first episode again before the finale, and resultingly have your mind explode about how everything makes sense now. Even the buildup in the first half of the show is very clever with its goofy comedy and colorful characters.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="578744">the first 2 or 3 episodes weren`t good but after than it gets really interesting and it has a satisfying ending</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="620834">It`s nothing like you have experience before. It`s mind blowing, heart wrenching and thrilling all at the same time. And it actually has an original, interesting male protagonist who doesn`t just trigger every flag by just being half-decent.
I ended up sobbing like a little girl by the near-last episodes. The story could have been more epic if it ended with more of a tragic note. But who am I to judge. After I`m done I`ve already felt in love whole-heartedly with the characters that I just couldn`t bear seeing them in any more pain.
See and judge for yourself</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="210645">This should be on everybody`s short list.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="372312">this anime is inspiring
very creative :D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="544654">This anime redifines epic. Clearly one of the best works in a while. You should drop whatever you are doing and watch this show NOW if you have not seen it yet.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="473165">you will get a laugh in the first 9 ep and you will cry in the rest . the plot is amazing , the characters background storys are the best , all in all a masterpiece ,abit slow to kick off but totally worth it</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="486670">must see, no words for this anime. I must say that the first twelve episodes don`t make much of a sense and let you a feeling that this anime is not special...BUT from that point and till the end, not only u start to realize that everything that it showed you was important, but so awesome that u will never forget it. Awesome plot, awesome characters, awesome romance...Plus a rare plot with time manipulate mystery and invention. also MUST SEE the 25 episode that was released with blu ray.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="211220">This is something that needs to be seen!! You`ll have to endure first 12 episodes to gather needed info, but then starts the best kind of torture, you live through it side by side with main characters. Amazing story, nice characters! And this is the first time I went through the hassle of writing a recommendation!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="531127">The best anime that I`ve seen in 2012. Seins Gate surprised me, very nice story, funny, a lot of tension and drama, great main characters. Definitly you must to see it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="525522">I honestly tried to watch this series about 3 times in the past year or so; I never got past the 2nd episode. I then watched Chaos;head and really loved the main character and the way the story was told. So, I decided to give Steins;Gate another try. Best decision ever! While its a little slow to get going(about 3 to 4 episodes before things get laid out and a few more episodes before things pick up), it tells one of the best stories in anime. Great story-telling, great plot, amazing characters, perfect character development; there is nothing I`d change about this series. Like I said, the beginning is slow, but everything in it is important and it all makes sense later. Its got clever humor, emotions, some action, and best of all: the dialogue. You won`t regret watching this anime. Do it as soon as you can.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="472569">im in love with this anime, every episode has a shocking thing inside, that makes u to get super excited when the next episode comes out! 
Its fully physics and science
i like it because they wont travel through time because they have god gift powers , they travel by science,, and the anime that happens in our time, makes it more lovable</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="281995">You HAVE to love the characters, and the plot just drags you in. Masterpieces reloaded!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="391755">Simply brilliant. Truly a masterpiece!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="585958">most impressive series of the 2011.
it`s deserve to be called "masterpiece".</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="207370">This is a must-see anime! It`s so brilliant in many ways. The first episodes aren`t that great but they are pretty much required in order to understand the storyline. It`s cool how the plot develops and gets really deep at the end of the anime :).

As for me Steins;Gate provided a lot to think about (the desire to change the past and regretting changing it etc.). I also grew to like the characters a lot. The OST is a masterpiece as well. Steins;Gate really knows how to set you in the mood. I`ll be eagerly waiting for the movie. Do yourself a favor and watch this anime!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="559673">MASTERPIECE!nothing more , nothing less!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="38226">Masterpiece.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="533655">Don`t judge a book by it`s cover. First episodes will make you think that it`s another harem trash with a stupid (borderline retarded) main character. Here`s the twist: it isn`t. Soon enough you`ll see a nicely done complex story with many interesting plot twists. There aren`t many good animes lately and this turned out astonishingly good. If you`ll ever give it a shot - watch it completely. You won`t regret it. That`s all I can say. El Psy Congroo.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="118817">Great character development and amazing story makes this a must watch for anyone, Once I started watching it grabbed me and never let go. Really enjoyed this and would reccomend it to anyone.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="556152">This Anime will do anything it can to fuck with your brain, emotions and memories, watch it trough the end and you will experience one of the best anime :) definite must see</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="454583">One of the best anime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="21092">For a series that can use an aspect much detested in another series (that being a certain 8 episodes from The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi Season 2), and turn it into an intriguing, and harrowing emotional roller-coaster that keeps one engaged until the very end - a truly laudable feat indeed!
Moreover, the production values of this series are very high: with attractive visuals, superb voice acting, and a well balanced, fitting, and memorable sound track (the ED in particular).
Steins Gate will not disappoint those seeking an intense sci-fi drama musing over topics including time travel theories, the butterfly effect, morality, and the bonds of friendship and love - a wide enough range to pique almost anyone`s interest.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="411316">Watched it, loved it. I definitely recommend everyone to watch it. Some might find the first two or so episodes to be slow/dull, but they`re absolutely necessary. It`s what comes after that makes this anime into a masterpiece. Don`t forget to watch the DVD Special ("Episode 25")!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="212957">Funny, heart warming, bizarre, deep, interesting... How the hell did they manage to fit all this and more in one show, and so perfectly...? A must see indeed!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="260637">Omg I cant even explain the awesomeness. I`ll never look at time traveling the same way after this anime. Stop reading and go watch it nowwwwwwww!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="405665">Despite slow and (imo) very confusing start, you begin to slowly put things together.
Then there is a moment of revelation when you think "Oh I get it! Cool!"
Then shit starts to happen all over again and you will be (maybe more) confused once more.
And it all head towards very emotional ending.

Don`t be discouraged by first episodes, it`s well worth the watch!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="301367">Time-travels, mad scientist, otaku culture, great cast of characters, comedy and much more. Try it and you`ll love it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="430077">A great anime with amazing and well designed characters, a very good choice of VAs and a very strong plot. The beginning focuses more on comedy but slowly it builds up a very deep story focused on time travel and cause &amp; effect. Teaches you what happens when you mess with the past. Interesting and beautiful anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="147092">I agree with the others.  Once the first few eps are done, the story makes a lot more sense and becomes very interesting.  Very original.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="628007">BEST THING EVER! I don`t even know how to explain how much i loved this anime. I loved the characters, the plot and time travel is always great. Watch it no matter what. Now. Stop reading and do it. You can thank me later.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="97207">You cannot miss this anime. With nail-biting cliff-hangers, adult romance (NOT "Omg we kissed!!! *Noseblood*" childish romance, we`ve seen WAY too much of in anime) and psychological drama, you will love this anime from start to end! If you like anime, and you`re tired of the childish harem/school plots, watch this! Your love for anime will be reignited, it is that good.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="545305">A must see in the true sense of the word. It has a fairly complex plot and by the time it ends you wish it hadn`t.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="727529">if 10/10 implies that an anime deeply touched someone, aside of being perfect in every other way, then this is 11/10. it doesn`t require you to have certain views, memories, it doesn`t require anything from you to resonate with you emotionally other than being human.

brilliant story, emotional roller coaster and a true must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="469392">If you are looking for an amazing anime, this is you call. You get in it from the first episode of this master piece.
A perfect combination of comedy, romance, thriller and much more. Also remember to watch the special episode :D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="442226">Damn, that was good. I don`t recall seeing any flaws, because I was watching it very fast. It`s got a theme that`s bothered humanity since its conception, namely time travel, and it does a splendid job on portraying it.</recommendation>

for real fans or you want more after the ending, play the visual novel!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="178631">pure awesomeness.
Definitely for sci-fi fans and for mind-twisting plot for everyone else.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="360204">Some people describe this series as having a slow start, but don`t let that turn you off.  I was worried before I started the show, but now I really disagree about the slow start.  Even from the very first episode you can already tell that there`s some weird stuff (in a good way) going on, even without knowing the premise of the show beforehand.

If you`ve heard of this, if you`re interested, start on it today.  You will be glad you did.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="162486">One of the best anime of this season.</recommendation>

End already?" and makes me really really longing for the next episode... really addictive... what? haven`t watch it? then WATCH IT!!! It really MORE THAN WORTH of your time.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="417666">This is one of the few VERY GOOD anime series I have seen so far. I recommend it to everyone. It has a very satisfying and logical plot on time travel subject. With the good story telling and animation quality, it`s a must see in my opinion.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="302304">best characters evar</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="424773">This anime is simply amazing! This anime is completely different from the other anime that you might expect. Instead of fantasy-based, it`s science. Lots of science and the storyline is amazing. Each episode passing by wants you to watch the next and it`s cool how they do that. So this anime is a must-see, especially if you`re a fan of Chaos;Head. ^^</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="135971">I just could not stop watching one episode after the other. Brilliant plot like a stack.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="366535">One of the best anime of the season! This is 99% science and 1% fiction! If you think about all that they say, it has lots of sense! It is not that they travel because "god wants" or "they have THE power"...It is logic!!! You MUST SEE!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="207137">In one word - awesome.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="515136">OKEEEEEEEEE this is the best anime for me (actually not just this), so i really recommended this even the protagonist little annoying first but in eps.12+ he`s very cool, oh yeah the romance is very touching too, and this is anime that can make my little heart crying :D.

<description>* Based on a visual novel by http://anidb.net/cr1334 [5pb] and http://anidb.net/cr1354 [Nitroplus].
In Akihabara a group of friends have managed to customize their microwave into a device that can send text messages into the past. As they perform different experiments, an organization named http://anidb.net/ch38123 [SERN] who has been doing their own research on time travel tracks them down and now the friends have to find a way to avoid being captured by them.
Note: The first episode received a preview screening in Tokyo on Sunday, March 6, 2011. Participants were chosen through an email lottery held until Monday, February 28. Two other preview screenings were held in Aichi, Nagoya`s Gamers branch on Saturday, March 12 and Osaka, Namba`s Gamers branch on Sunday, March 13.

<name>trap</name>
<description>A trap is a plot device where a male character is mistaken for a female, with the intention of sexually deceiving other characters and/or the viewer. This behavior does not need to be intentional by the male (it is often not intentional) or continually maintained by the male, but the occurrence is common enough to deserve this fetish-specific tag.
This is often achieved by portraying the male character as a female; primarily via their clothing and physical appearance, but also through his behaviour, and/or language. A male character misinterpreted by others as female, without action from the male (explicitly feminine dress or behaviour), is generally not considered a trap; instead they are likely just http://anidb.net/t2561 [androgynous].
The reverse case is known as a http://anidb.net/t1637 [reverse trap].

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

In some cases there is futuristic technology present, but the overall setting still feels that of the past. However the setting must still take place on Earth, since we can not know if the history of a fantasy world is an alternate one or not.</description>

For clarification, visual novels are considered a sub-genre of adventure games and the term does not cover simulations.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<description>A dystopia (from Ancient Greek: δυσ-, "bad, ill", and Ancient Greek: τόπος, "place, landscape"; alternatively cacotopia, or anti-utopia) is, in literature, an often futuristic society that has degraded into a repressive and controlled state, often under the guise of being utopian. Dystopian literature has underlying cautionary tones, warning society that if we continue to live how we do, this will be the consequence. A dystopia, thus, is regarded as a sort of negative utopia and is often characterized by an authoritarian or totalitarian form of government. Dystopias usually feature different kinds of repressive social control systems, a lack or total absence of individual freedoms and expressions and constant states of warfare or violence. Dystopias often explore the concept of humans abusing technology and how humans individually and collectively cope with technology that has evolved too quickly such as the car, the flamethrower or the microwave. A dystopian society is also often characterized by widespread poverty and brutal political controls such as a large military-like police.</description>

<description>Usually metaphorical. Sometimes literal. At times both!
Typically this refers to the fact that the story is set in a grim, dog eat dog milieu — for example a decaying city.
Often the characters are just doing what they need to do to survive, with little or no expectation that their lives can be better. And often characters may feel they do not have any real choice in what they do.
And yes, occasionally the setting is actually dark — be it night or perpetually heavy cloudy sky and rain. It all adds to the oppressive, hopeless feeling of the show.
You probably will not feel uplifted or happy after watching this anime.</description>

<description>A `mind fuck` is a slang term which describes a work that uses literary devices such as nonlinear storytelling and plot twists in order to present convoluted, yet not conflicting, themes.
A creation is usually considered a mind fuck when a casual observer is not able to discern the true meaning of a work without making a serious attempt to unravel the themes presented or when the plot is incredibly difficult to follow.
Special examples of mind fucks involve a single plot twist which completely changes the viewer`s understanding of the events in a film or novel as well as the ideas it presents.</description>

<description>Term used to refer to a person who takes on the role of their opposite gender. This often only reaches to the extent of cross-dressing (involving physical appearance and clothing only), but in rarer cases, involves a total gender swap (which seems to be more common in anime) - where the willing or unwilling victim receives a body opposite of their original gender (either permanently or temporarily), with all natural parts per their new body fully (or just all-out amply) included.
Example of cross-dressing gender bender: "Maria+Holic"
Examples of body-swap gender bender: "Kashimashi: Girl meets Girl", "Birdy the Mighty Decode"</description>

<description>Engrish is actually a mispronunciation of English, as can be the result of someone, who does not have English as their primary language of origin (such as Japanese or Chinese). Occasionally characters in the original Japanese dialogue version of an anime will speak in English... however; this often still requires the assistance of subtitles, for while the words are meant to be said in English, the sentence structure and letter pronunciation may still be strongly related to the person’s primary language.</description>

<name>time loop</name>
<description>A time loop is a common plot device in science fiction (especially in universes where time travel is commonplace). Events in the story repeat themselves a number of times with or without some variation with each pass. Most characters either do not realise this is occurring or are attempting to break the cycle in some way. 
One well-known example of this is in the 1993 film Groundhog Day, in which the main character is the only one aware of the time loop, although time loops had appeared in many fictional works prior to that. Stories with time loops commonly center on correcting past mistakes or on getting a character to recognise some key truth; escape from the loop may then follow.</description>

<name>just as planned</name>
<description>A term usually used to describe a situation, where a seemingly smart and cunning villain sets up a plan that seems grand and impressive, but is actually long winding, ridiculous, and convoluted. And all of that just to trick his opponent(s), like the hero or anybody else, into doing things exactly as he planned. Suffice to say that the villain could have reached his goal by much shorter and easier means, it just wouldn`t seem as awesome anymore.
The phrase is also known as the original Japanese "keikaku doori" where keikaku stands translated for "plan" or "schedule", and doori for "in accordance with ..." or "following ...".
The phrase is a reference to http://anidb.net/ch301 [Yagami Light] from http://anidb.net/a4563 [Death Note], and his love for plans.</description>

<name>the power of love</name>
<description>The power of love is not only the strongest power known to mankind, it is the strongest power in the universe. The power of love conquers all things. It makes people cry, it makes people laugh, it can make them sing and occasionally it even brings dead people back to life, just so.
More so than the power of friendship, the power of true love gives boundless strength and resolution; by the power of love every hardship can be overcome, every issue can be resolved and it does make people resistant to food poisoning (caused by the bad cooking of their loved ones). Even the big bad evil doesn`t stand a chance against the power of true love and often ends up redeemed.
Even when the power of love is not literally and directly responsible, the scene is often set so that the audience is left with the impression that it was "really responsible".</description>

He also talks to himself on the cellphone, his words not making much sense. Supposedly, he has very few friends that can understand what he`s talking about.
Often calls himself "Hououin Kyouma" (鳳凰院凶真).
Mayuri and Daru just call him "Okarin" (オカリン), abbreviated after his name.
The phrase he uses to end conversations, particularly with himself, is "El Psy Kongroo"

Plenty of statements he makes could be taken as sexual harassment. He and Rintarou have known each other since high school. Usually turns down Rintarou`s ridiculous requests as "annoying", but in truth gets them done in proper order. However, he trusts Rintarou as a friend. Has great confidence in his programming and hacking abilities (he doesn`t mind being called a Super Hacker, but doesn`t like it when people call him Super Haker). He`s always in front of the computer.
Has the nickname "Daru" (ダル), abbreviated after his name.</description>

Uses honorifics specifically with Rintarou. Doesn`t push his opinions much upon others, but when he does he`s quite bashful and blushes quite a bit. Because he`s quite serious by nature, he simply believes what others say. Thanks to that, he thinks all the ridiculous stuff Rintarou talks about is that of reality. Rintarou makes him out to be his student on his own, and is currently in the middle of brainwashing him. A very shy person, he often turns down Mayuri`s requests to cosplay.</description>

<description>A research member in Victor Qondria University`s Brain Research Program (age group matches that of third-year high school, but skipped a grade through America`s educational system). She is famous in America for writing thesis papers, part of which is covered in the news. Thanks to skipping a grade in America as a girl, she was envied by people around her, and ended up building a strong personality. She doesn`t like to show weakness to others and so she always has a stern expression. However, she is very curious and when she builds interest she pokes into things. Occassionally has views that differ from regular opinion, like, "The experiment data is more important than the subject`s privacy." Rintarou often tells her, "Hey, you`ve got a pretty good sense of being a Mad Scientist", but she`s not one to agree to such things personally.
Rintarou has given her plenty of nicknames, in particular "Christina" (クリスティーナ) and "Assistant" (助手).</description>

A little too familiar with things, but doesn`t dig too deep. Not quite comfortable with having other people help her. For that reason, she spends as little time as possible. Her personality drastically changes when it comes to her own interests. Proactive. Has a habit of using strange and difficult vocabulary at times, but somehow you can tell she`s purposely doing so. Ended up hanging out with the Future Gadget Laboratory since she started working at the CRT TV Workshop.</description>

<summary>With further information about SERN`s time travel experiments encrypted in a code that Daru can`t decipher, Rintaro learns from Titor that he needs the IBN 5100 computer Moeka was looking for in order to decode it. While out doing his laundry, Rintaro runs into Kurisu, who is still in denial about a time machine existing and tells her about the IBN 5100. As Kurisu hears from a contact about the computer`s capabilities, maid café owner Faris Nyan-Nyan informs Rintaro that her family had donated an IBN 5100 to Ruka`s family shrine. Managing to borrow the IBN 5100 from Ruka`s father, Rintaro and Kurisu carry it back to the lab.

<summary>Rintaro agrees to let Kurisu exam their PhoneWave on the condition that she become one of his fellow lab members. Performing another experiment with the PhoneWave, which causes a burst of electricity when Mayuri opens it, Rintaro succeeds in sending another e-mail to the past. This leads Rintaro deduce that their PhoneWave is actually a time machine capable of sending text messages to the past. As Kurisu leaves the lab in denial, Rintaro hears about the Large Hadron Collider and micro black holes and asks Daru to hack into SERN. Later, after hearing from Titor about SERN allegedly creating a dystopian future, Rintaro and Daru learn that SERN have been performing top secret experiments with micro black holes, which have resulted in human deaths.

<summary>Surprised to find Kurisu alive, Rintaro is subsequently humiliated by her during a lecture concerning the unlikeliness of time travel. After getting some provisions from the androgynous Urushibara Ruka, Rintaro meets Amane Suzuha, who is hired by his landlord Yuugo "Mr. Braun" Tennouji as a part time assistant in his electronics shop. Later, Rintaro investigates the supposedly altered events and learns that a man calling himself John Titor, who claimed in 2000 that he was a time traveler, has surfaced once more in 2010. Believing this John Titor to be a fake, Rintaro is shocked to find that all evidence of Titor appearing in 2000 have disappeared. The next day, Rintaro encounters a strange woman named Moeka Kiryuu who asks for information on a retro PC model called the IBN 5100, which Rintaro gathers from Daru. Later, as Rintaro and Daru once again experiment with their Phonewave, a banana disappears from the oven and appears reattached to its bunch in gel form, at which point Kurisu arrives at the lab.

<summary>In the summer of 2010, self-proclaimed mad scientist Okabe Rintarou and his childhood friend Shiina Mayuri go to the Akihabara Radio Kaikan building to attend a seminar on time travel by Doctor Nakabachi. While there, Rintaro meets a girl named Makise Kurisu, who claims to have met him fifteen minutes before despite having never met her himself. Later, after receiving a scrambled video message on his phone, Rintaro hears a scream and discovers Kurisu lying in a pool of blood, indicating that she was stabbed to death. Upon sending an e-mail about the situation to his friend, Itaru "Daru" Hashida, Rintaro feels a strange sensation, before discovering the streets have become vacant and a strange satellite has crashed into the radio building. Later, as Rintaro`s "Future Gadget Laboratory" work on a phone-controlled microwave that turns bananas into gelatinous form, Rintaro is surprised to learn that the seminar he was attending was apparently cancelled, as if it had never taken place. Afterwards, as Rintaro and Daru go to a forum being held, Rintaro discovers the e-mail he sent Daru about Kurisu`s stabbing had arrived three days earlier, before coming across Kurisu, who is alive and well.

<summary>Arriving back at the lab with Rintaro, Kurisu is met with a strange reaction from Suzuha. While the gang gathering parts needed to connect the IBN 5100 with Daru`s PC, Suzuha warns Rintaro to be cautious of Kurisu. Using the IBN 5100 to decipher SERN`s encrypted files, Rintaro, Daru, and Kurisu learn that various people have been found dead in a gel-like state in various points in time as a result of their experiments. Kurisu deduces that the gelatinous state is the result of matter being squeezed at a molecular level whilst passing through the micro black hole. Despite the shock of this news, Rintaro vows to perfect the PhoneWave.

<summary>With the ability to utilize SERN`s LHC to compress memories into D-Mail size, Kurisu completes her time leap machine, capable of sending one`s memories up to two days into the past. However, Rintaro, still disturbed by the threatening texts he has received, decides against using the device, suggesting they instead make their discoveries public. As the lab members decide to have a party, Kurisu comes into conflict with Suzuha, who claims she is destined to become a SERN spy in the future, but Mayuri manages to calm things down between. While a bomb threat is televised, Suzuha, after hearing about the lab`s connection to SERN, flees the lab. Just then, a group of armed men storm the lab led by Moeka, who reveals herself to be a "Rounder" hired by SERN. She orders Rintaro, Kurisu, and Daru to be detained before shooting and killing Mayuri, who she deems is not being necessary.

<summary>Rintaro discovers that a CRT television in the electronics shop below the lab has been serving as the "lifter" from the PhoneWave, as the D-Mails can only be sent when it is turned on. Kurisu then theorizes that it might be possible to send frontal lobe memories back in time through the PhoneWave, allowing the consciousness of a person to "time leap" into the past. As Rintaro goes into town with Mayuri to look for parts Kurisu needs, he explains to her that a time leap may be safer to conduct than simply sending D-Mails due to the nature of chaos theory, as the D-Mails can produce unexpected consequences once sent. They run into Moeka along the way, as well as Suzuha, who tells Rintaro that Kurisu allegedly works for SERN. As Kurisu denies this, she tells Rintaro about the problems she has with her father, who grew to hate her because she surpassed him in scientific prowess. Later on when out shopping, Okabe receives another threatening text message with a picture of a severed doll`s head attached, causing him to return to the lab, fearing for Mayuri`s safety. Later, Daru informs the group that the lab has been connected to the SERN network without them knowing.

<summary>Realising the D-Mail Faris sent prevented moe culture from being introduced into Akihabara, he discovers that Ruka`s earlier D-Mail had in fact changed his gender to female. Afterwards, Rintaro talks with Suzuha, who reveals she came to Tokyo to try to find her father, mentioning she will leave if she is unable to find him the next day. Rintaro then establishes her as a lab member and invites her to the lab for a farewell party. While preparing for the party, Rintaro receives a threatening text message telling him that someone is watching him, with a picture of a gelatin treat attached. Later, while shopping with Mayuri, he recalls that his Reading Steiner ability may have first occurred when he was a child. Later that night, Suzuha sends a farewell text to Rintaro, prompting him to send a D-Mail to himself ordering him to convince Suzuha to attend the party and stay in Tokyo.

<summary>As Faris learns about the PhoneWave upon overhearing a discussion between Rintaro and Daru, Rintaro discovers that the IBN has gone missing from the lab, which was apparently never found in the first place as a result of Moeka`s D-Mail. Kurisu deduces that the minor changes to the past that resulted from their previous D-Mails has caused a butterfly effect, leading to changes beyond their control. After learning that the IBN 5100 had been previously taken from Ruka`s shrine, Rintaro finds Moeka in town and confronts her, only to learn that she does not know the whereabouts of the IBN either. Rintaro also discovers that, unlike the previous World Line, everyone has met Moeka before in the current one, giving creedence to Kurisu`s theory. Rintaro and the others later visit Faris, whose true identity is revealed to be Akiha Rumiho, whose family owns Akihabara. Faris offers them information on the IBN 5100 in exchange for being allowed to send a D-Mail ten years into the past. Rintaro reluctantly agrees and allows her to send the D-Mail, causing him to experience another World Line shift. After learning from Faris`s father that they no longer have the IBN 5100 in their possession, Rintaro discovers that the physical geography of Akihabara has completely changed, no longer being a mecca for anime culture.

As the experiments resume, Moeka requests to send a D-Mail, which shifts Rintaro to a new World Line where no one else remembers Moeka. The next day, Ruka comes to the lab, asking to send a D-Mail to before he was born so that he would be born as a girl. Using an urban myth about how a diet can affect a baby`s gender before birth, the group send a D-Mail to Ruka`s mother`s pager, sending Rintaro to another world line, although he doesn`t notice any obvious changes.

<summary>After Daru updates the Phone Microwave`s firmware, Rintaro decides to perform an experiment attempting to change history by sending winning lottery numbers to the past. Upon sending the D-Mail, he experiences a sensation similar to the one he had before the satellite crash. Discovering no one else was aware that the experiment even took place, Rintaro finds his D-Mail had indeed led to Ruka purchasing a lottery ticket, although his own personal error led him to get the number wrong. After a brief encounter with Suzuha, Rintaro deduces that the D-Mail had shifted him to a World Line Ruka had bought a lottery ticket and the D-Mail experiment never took place, explaining everyone`s altered memories. Confused as to why only he can remember the previous World Line, Rintaro contacts Titor, who tells him he may have the power to become a messiah and lead the world beyond the "1% Divergence" point and hence, change the dystopian future.

<summary>As each of Rintaro`s attempts to save Mayuri keep ending in failure, he learns that from Moeka that the lab was targeted by SERN due to their creation of a time machine and their plan to publicly announce it. Falling into despair over his repeated failures, Rintaro is approached by Kurisu, who gets him to reveal his situation and gives him key trigger phrases to get her past self to cooperate with him. After being sent to just before the time leap machine`s completion, Rintaro manages to obtain Kurisu`s aid before they are both approached by Suzuha. She explains that in order to save Mayuri, they need to escape the "Alpha World Line Attractor Field", where Mayuri is doomed to die, due to the converging nature of world lines, and cross the 1% Divergence point to the Beta World Line, where the outcome might possibly be different. Suzuha then takes Rintaro and Kurisu to the crashed satellite, which turns out to be a time machine, and reveals she is in fact "John Titor" and has come from the year 2036.

<summary>Moments after Mayuri`s death, Suzuha rushes in the lab and creates a distraction, allowing Kurisu to use the time leap machine to send Rintaro back in time to 5pm the same day. Rintaro drives everyone out of the lab before frantically searching for Mayuri, during which he receives a call from Kurisu, who deduces that he made a time leap. Finding Mayuri, Rintaro attempts to flee with her to the station, only for the trains to have stopped. When they are both approached by Rounders, they attempt to flee, but Mayuri is once again killed when she is run over by Moeka`s car. Escaping the Rounders` clutches and performing another time leap, Rintaro locates Mayuri earlier and escapes to the subway station. However, Mayuri is killed once again when Yuugo`s daughter, Nae, accidentally pushes her in the path of an oncoming train. Devastated, Rintaro vows to keep leaping to the past until he manages to save Mayuri.

<summary>Picking up a light up sword in order to use its liquid as a substitute for Kurisu`s blood, Rintaro and Suzuha return to the day of Kurisu`s death. In order to prevent a Metal Upa toy that would prevent Nakabichi`s paper from being destroyed by an on-board fire, Rintaro obtains it himself so that Mayuri ends up with a plastic one, which would later make its way to Kurisu and Nakabichi. Finding that the liquid in the gadget has dried up, Rintaro provokes Nakabachi into stabbing him, leading him to run off in fear with Kurisu`s theory. After knocking Kurisu out with a taser, Rintaro uses his own blood from his stab wound and to recreate the scene he originally saw, fooling his past self and sending him on his time-hopping journey. As Rintaro returns to the present, Suzuha gives her thanks before she disappears, as she does not exist yet in the Steins Gate world line. After recovering his wounds, Rintaro starts giving out badges to the lab members he recruited in other World Lines, saving one for Suzuha, who will be born in seven years. Later, while walking in the streets of Akihabara, Rintaro has a chance encounter with Kurisu, who appears to have retained some memories of the other World Lines.

<summary>Suzuha explains that her mission is to prevent Kurisu`s death and enter a World Line known as Steins Gate, in which World War III never happens. Wanting to save Kurisu, Rintaro travels to the past with Suzuha in her time machine, arriving prior to Kurisu`s death. Witnessing events unfold as they did, Rintaro briefly runs into Kurisu, explaining their prior encounter, before hiding in the room where she will be stabbed. There, Kurisu meets with her father, revealed to be Doctor Nakabachi, who attempts to take ownership of her time travel theory for himself. Rintaro attempts to save Kurisu but inadvertently stabs her himself, allowing Nakabachi to escape with her theory to Russia, an event that will lead to a time machine arms race and eventually, World War III. As Rintaro falls into despair and refuses Suzuha`s offer of a second attempt, Mayuri slaps him, stating that that he was never one to give up on someone or something. Suzuha then reveals that Rintaro was intended to fail the first attempt so that the scrambled video message he received on the day of Kurisu`s death could be made viewable. This turns out to be a video from his future self, explaining that the key to saving Kurisu without changing the events that led him to develop the time machine and causing a paradox is to fool his past self into believing Kurisu has died.

<summary>Kurisu reveals to Rintaro that she recalls her stabbing from dreams, as well as Rintaro`s various attempts at saving Mayuri. When Kurisu tells Rintaro that he should save Mayuri over her, he cannot accept it and runs back to the lab. As Rintaro attempts to time leap again, Kurisu stops him, worried that seeing Mayuri die over and over will destroy him. After giving in and choosing to save Mayuri, Rintaro tells Kurisu he loves her, to which she responds by kissing him. The next day, Kurisu prepares to return to America, while Rintaro and the others delete the original D-Mail from the SERN network. Just after erasing the data, Kurisu returns to the lab to tell him that she loves him, but is cut off as Rintaro shifts back to the Beta World Line. Some time after getting rid of the PhoneWave, Rintaro receives a call from an alternate Suzuha, telling him she needs his help to prevent World War III.

<summary>Despite Okabe knowing the location of the IBN 5100, Kurisu advises against trying to steal it, instead suggesting that he stake out the location in order to find FB, with Moeka deciding to join him. As they observe the IBN 5100 being taken out, they follow it as it is passed along to several people, including Yuugo, before it ends up on a plane bound for France, where SERN is located. Rintaro, Moeka, and Kurisu go to confront Yuugo, who reveals himself to be FB and a Rounder who was forced to do SERN`s bidding to prevent harm from befalling Nae. Following the code of the Rounders for those who fail their mission, Yuugo kills Moeka before taking his own life. Rintaro then uses Yuugo`s cell phone to finally cancel out Moeka`s D-Mail, returning to a World Line where both Moeka and Yuugo are alive and the IBN 5100 is once again in their possession. As Rintaro gets Daru to hack into the SERN network to erase the data they have on them, he comes to the sudden realization that by doing so, he would have to return to a World Line where Kurisu is dead.

<summary>Rintaro tells Ruka about how she used to be a male and urges her to reverse the D-Mail responsible in order to change Mayuri`s fate. While she initially doesn`t believe him, she later agrees to do so on the condition that Rintaro takes her on a date. Despite Kurisu and Daru`s advice on dating, Rintaro and Ruka spend their date together in awkward conversation. Like Faris, Ruka eventually recalls the previous World Line where she was a male, distressing her as a return to it would prevent her from pursuing her feelings for Rintaro. Before sending the D-Mail that would negate Ruka`s first one, Rintaro realizes that the reason they did not enjoy their date was that he was trying to be someone he was not. As a result, Rintaro returns to the shrine and spends the rest of the day training with Ruka like they used to. With their relationship repaired, Rintaro sends the D-Mail, moving back to a World Line where Ruka is a boy, leaving the next D-Mail to be reversed: Moeka`s.

<summary>Despite the change in divergence, Mayuri`s death still takes place, albeit a day later than in the previous World Line. Kurisu theorize that, since negating Rintaro`s D-Mail stopping Suzuha delayed the attack, undoing the effects of the other D-Mails could bring them back to a World Line where they have an IBN 5100, allowing them to hack into SERN and delete the records that set them on their trail. Rintaro starts by trying to figure out how to reverse Faris`s D-Mail. After helping her evade a rival gang of Rai-Net players, Rintaro takes Faris to the place where her maid café used to be and tells her about the way Akihabara was. This causes Faris to recall some of her memories from that World Line and the D-Mail she sent: a fake ransom note, which prevented her father from boarding a plane fated to crash. The rival gang catches up to them but they are rescued by the arrival of Faris`s father. Speaking to him, Rintaro learns that he was forced to sell the IBN 5100 he had in order to pay for the fake kidnapping`s ransom. After accepting the reality of her father`s death, Faris agrees to send a D-Mail cancelling out her previous one, turning Akihabara back into a moe hub. The IBN 5100, however, still remains out of Rintaro`s reach.

<summary>Unable to get much information about the badge maker`s client, Rintaro decides to leap back in time to confront the client in question, only to find it was Daru, who wanted to make a fake badge to cheer Suzuha up. Daru then reveals that Suzuha`s time machine is only able to travel backwards in time, meaning they won`t be able to see her again once she leaves. As the repairs to the time machine are completed, Mayuri deduces from the time machine`s name that Suzuha`s father is actually Daru. After a short reunion, Suzuha travels back to 1975, though Rintaro notices the Divergence Meter`s reading has not changed. A few hours later, Yuugo delivers a letter written by Suzuha in the year 2000, revealing that she had committed suicide a year later. In the letter, Suzuha laments that she had failed her mission, as the damages to the time machine caused her to crash and lose her memories for 24 years. Blaming himself for stopping Suzuha on the night of the storm that damaged the time machine, Rintaro sends a D-Mail that stops him from following Suzuha, letting her use the time machine before it was damaged. Speaking with Yuugo again in the new World Line, Rintaro learns that Suzuha had died of illness instead and receives her Divergence Meter, which is now showing a different value.

<summary>Suzuha explains how SERN was able to build a time machine and use it to create a totalitarian world in 2036, stating that she had originally planned to travel to 1975 to acquire an IBN 5100, but made a detour to the year 2010 to look for her father. When she tries to start the time machine, she discovers it has broken down, which Rintaro realizes was a result of the storm on the night he stopped her from leaving. Leaping to two days before the completion of the time leap machine, Rintaro gathers the lab members to inform them of the situation. While Daru is tasked with fixing Suzuha`s time machine, Mayuri suggests that everyone also help Suzuha find her father, using a pin badge he gave her as a clue. Suzuha also gives Rintaro a device called the Divergence Meter, which keeps track of the magnitude of differences between World Lines, and tells him about how he founded the resistance against SERN in the future. After spending the day searching for Suzuha`s father, Rintaro is thanked by Suzuha before receiving a lead on Suzuha`s father from a badge maker.

<summary>Two months after the main storyline, Rintaro, Daru, Mayuri, and Ruka are invited by Faris to come to Los Angeles, where she will participate in a Rai-Net tournament, reuniting with Kurisu upon their arrival. Due to Rintaro`s cancellation of Faris`s hotel reservations for them as a result of his ego, the group ends up checking into a motel. Later that night, Kurisu talks to Rintaro about the dreams she has had of past World Lines and the romance they shared. After visiting the card tournament Faris had entered, Rintaro spots someone that looks like Suzuha and chases after her, having a conversation in which she mentions that a fortune teller had foretold her having a child in seven years. After the girl leaves, Rintaro discovers that his phone is uncharged and he is almost broke, leading him to make his way back to the city on foot. He is eventually found by Kurisu, who becomes stranded with him after her car is found to be out of gas. While waiting to be rescued, the two discuss about the World Line where they confessed their love for each other, leading Rintaro to make his confession once again.
