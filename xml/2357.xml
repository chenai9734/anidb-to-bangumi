<description>Zora was an outlaw planet where they had a rule that one could own stolen things if he could run away keeping it for three days.
When Motorcycle gang, Sand Rat, was driving on the planet, they were attacked by a walker machine. Then, an injured boy, Jiron, helped them. Lag, the leader of Sand Rat was interested in Jiron because he was going to the bazaar to steal a walker machine. That bazaar was held by Charring Cargo who was a courier of Blue Stone, and there must be the guards of Carrying and rowdy fellows at the bazaar. Furthermore, to be surprised, it was Carrying`s latest walker machine, Xabungle, that he wanted to steal.

<description>A robot is an automatically guided machine, able to do tasks on its own. Another common characteristic is that by its appearance or movements, a robot often conveys a sense that it has intent or agency of its own.

<description>Mecha in Japanese basically means mechanical things; everything from an electric whisk or a car to a spaceship or a robot. Here however we limit it to the more exotic things usually referred to as mecha anime: robots, whether controlled by a human or not, and their ilk. See Androids, Piloted Robots, Power Suits, Robot Helpers, Transforming Robots for a more specific classification.</description>

<name>comedy</name>
<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>Super Robot Wars</name>
<description>Super Robot Wars is a series of tactical role-playing video games produced by Banpresto. The main feature of the franchise is having a story that crosses over several popular mecha anime, manga and video games, allowing characters and mecha from different titles to team up or battle one another. Due to the nature of crossover games and licensing involved, only a few games have been released outside Japan, and in English; early English-language games only feature Banpresto`s original characters and mecha, and a flagship installment were to never be released until 2016, with the English release of Super Robot Wars V in Southeast Asian countries. The franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2016.

<name>Elchi Cargo</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Daughter of Carrying Cargo, she becomes its captain following his death. Elchi is obsessed with culture and often has aspirations of abandoning the Iron Gear as a result, but continuously returns to it. She angers easily and is often in conflict with many members of the Iron Gear crew. In the second half of the series she is captured by the Innocent and brainwashed into desiring the destruction of the Iron Gear and the death of Jiron. She is given the Iron Gear-like landship Gear Gear, and later another landship which she calls the Carrying. She launches multiple attacks on the Iron Gear with these ships. She is often in conflict with her subordinates.

As the series draws to a close Elchi is captured by Jiron and the others. They are able to remove her brainwashing by shifting her new personality to Arthur Rank, and Elchi returns to her normal self. During the final battle she fights against Kashim and Viram but is blinded by an explosion.
