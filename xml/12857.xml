<description>Eating half-cooked fish, leaving food scraps lying around until they are covered in flies, washing clothes in the river, etc. leads to the spread of terrible diseases without anyone even being aware of it. Disinfection with a bleaching powder solution is essential to prevent that from occurring. In addition, it is important to wear a mask to prevent germs from entering into the body and to disinfect bedding by exposure to sunlight. Negligence of one person affects the whole family and eventually causes disease to spread throughout Japan. For this reason, awareness about spreading the concept of hygiene is promoted.
