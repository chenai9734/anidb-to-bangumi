<description>* Based on the re-edited first part of the story from the television series http://anidb.net/a4575 [Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann] with some newly animated scenes.
In the distant future, people build their homes and raise domestic animals in subterranean caverns called pits. This way of life has persisted for hundreds of years, and yet, the people are still powerless against the earthquakes and cave-ins which occasionally devastate their villages. Jeeha is one such village...
One day, while digging tunnels to expand Jeeha, a boy named http://anidb.net/ch469 [Simon] happens to find a small, shiny drill. Meanwhile, http://anidb.net/ch468 [Kamina] — Simon`s soon-to-be "bro" — insists that there is another land above the village and tries to break through the ceiling in order to leave the cavern. He fails; however, an earthquake suddenly occurs, the ceiling collapses, and a gigantic robot — a Ganmen — crashes to the cave floor!
Kamina is now certain that there is a world above their tiny pit-village. Encouraged, he begins to fight recklessly against the robot, until he encounters another person who has arrived from the land above. She is a beautiful girl by the name of http://anidb.net/ch470 [Youko], who has come from a neighbouring village with a rifle in hand. She has been hunting the robot, but her shots only seem to irritate it. Desperately trying to escape its attacks, Simon brings Kamina and Yoko to what he had previously found: A mysterious robot with a head for a body.
And so begins the "epic" adventure...

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>absurdist humour</name>
<description>Surreal humour, also known as absurdist humour, is a form of humour predicated on deliberate violations of causal reasoning, producing events and behaviours that are obviously illogical. Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, non-sequiturs, irrational or absurd situations, and expressions of nonsense.
The humour arises from a subversion of audience`s expectations, so that amusement is founded on unpredictability, separate from a logical analysis of the situation. Its appeal stems from the fact that the situation described is exceedingly ridiculous or unlikely.
On an analytical level, all jokes contain a certain amount of incongruity, but while regular jokes carry an incongruity that the audience accepts as compatible with expectations, absurd jokes are characterized by a disproportionate amount of it, with the punch line delivering a situation incompatible with the world as we know it and failing to resolve the matter in the audience`s eyes.

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>disaster</name>
<description>A disaster is a large-scale situation that causes great loss of or damage or threat to life, health, property, society, or the environment, irrespective of its source or cause. Disasters have substantial, long-lasting negative repercussions, and great effort must be spent in order to undo or mitigate their effects.</description>

<name>post-apocalyptic</name>
<description>An anime that takes place on future Earth (or it could be an alternative universe) after a major cataclysm has occurred. World War III, an alien invasion, plague, global warming or some other general disaster are common themes to build a post-apocalyptic world upon, where the effects were severe enough that mankind barely survived.
The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologised). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in an agrarian, non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of technology remain. There is a considerable degree of blurring between post-apocalyptic fiction and that which deals with false utopias or dystopian societies.</description>

<name>Super Robot Wars</name>
<description>Super Robot Wars is a series of tactical role-playing video games produced by Banpresto. The main feature of the franchise is having a story that crosses over several popular mecha anime, manga and video games, allowing characters and mecha from different titles to team up or battle one another. Due to the nature of crossover games and licensing involved, only a few games have been released outside Japan, and in English; early English-language games only feature Banpresto`s original characters and mecha, and a flagship installment were to never be released until 2016, with the English release of Super Robot Wars V in Southeast Asian countries. The franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2016.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kamina is a young man from Jeeha village who dreams of leaving the village and go to the surface, which he saw as a child. He`s very passionate about his goals, expressing his wishes through energetic speeches, which seem to affect all those who hear them.
As the leader of the "Gurren Brigade", he convinces Simon to aid him in his plan to drill through the roof of the village and get to the world above, but the plan fails and he is imprisoned. After defeating an invading Gunmen, he leaves the village with Simon and Yoko, in the cockpit of a tiny but powerful Gunmen Simon unearths and Kamina names "Lagann".
Kamina is extremely impulsive, and sometimes acts with little regard for his life. His plans are rarely well thought-out, often relying solely on brute strength and determination to win, but for some strange reason or another, they seem to work most of the time. It is revealed that Kamina`s impulsive confidence is mostly a show to give Simon the courage to act. He believes that in reality, all he can do is give Simon the motivation to "reach the heavens"; he couldn`t do it himself.</description>

<description>Simon is a fourteen year-old digger from Jeeha village. Although he is initially looked down upon because of it, Simon excels at drilling through the ground, and the drill quickly becomes his trademark symbol. One day, he finds a mysterious drill-shaped item, which is later revealed to be the "Core Drill", for a head-shaped Gunmen he also finds buried in the soil. With the help of the small Gunmen, Kamina, and Yoko, he fights off a much larger Gunmen that falls into the village. In the process of defeating the invader, they reach the surface world. Prior to the time-skip, Simon is mostly depicted as merely following Kamina`s lead and often acting as a counter-balance to Kamina`s impulsiveness. An unfortunate accident forces Simon to mature and take up a leadership role within Team Dai-Gurren.</description>

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>The Gurren, originally named the "Gunzar" as mentioned by other Beastmen in the manga, is initially an above-average sized Beastmen-piloted mecha, which attacked Litner Village the morning after Team Gurren`s arrival early in the series. The mech is subsequently captured, rebuilt, stylised and named by its eventual pilot, Kamina, who had the Gurren`s original swords converted into massive sunglasses similar to his own that could be used as a blade or boomerang in combat. Being of typical Gunmen proportions, the Gurren is capable to fight without the Lagann`s power. While its individual power was initially not on the same level as advanced Gunmen/pilot pairs, such as Viral and his Enki, Kamina eventually became experienced enough to hold his own against multiple enemies.
After Kamina`s death, the Gurren was mainly piloted by Rossiu and one-time pilots until the aftermath of the battle of Tepplin, pilotless until Viral becomes the Gurren`s offical pilot during the battle against the AntiSpirals. Gurren (紅蓮) means "Crimson Lotus". As a homage to it, a white Gunzar unit is seen during the battle of Tepplin, sporting a pair of pistols rather than blades.</description>

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>The Lagann is Simon`s personal Gunmen which he finds in the first episode while digging tunnels in his village. It received its name, Lagann (羅顔), meaning "enveloping face", from Kamina and draws power from the Core Drill, a small golden drill Simon uses similar to an ignition key. Unlike any other Gunmen in the series, the Lagann sports a unique cockpit and stands just short of an average human adult as opposed to the others which are all mostly the sizes of small buildings or larger. This physical handicap, in tandem with the usually average level of fighting spirit supplied to it by Simon, puts the Lagann at a considerable disadvantage in single combat against enemy Gunmen. However, when Simon is driven to give his best during combat the Lagann`s power increases exponentially, giving it the unique ability to generate drills from nearly any part of its frame. Lagann`s other and most notable power is the "Lagann Impact", its trademark ability to combine with other machines by piercing them with its drills. It`s through this ability that the titular Gurren Lagann is created, along with the other more large-scale mechas in the series.</description>

<description>Viral is a member of the Human Eradication Army, who regards Kamina as a strong rival. Though being among the more humanoid of the Beastmen, his DNA contains aspects of shark and feline genetics. He pilots Enkidudu, which mainly utilizes swords and a powerful laser. He is extremely loyal to Lordgenome and the four supreme generals, and he does his best to serve them. After Kamina`s death, he continues to fight Gurren-Lagann, thinking that Kamina is still alive, and he is shocked once he learns the truth. He is given the gift of immortality by Lordgenome, so that he could spread his legacy. After the fall of the empire, he resurfaces and causes an uproar with his Gunmen, calling Simon out to fight him. He is later taken into custody, and pilots Gurren during the battle against the Anti-Spirals. Viral thus becomes a `reformed villain` of sorts. It is also shown that his deepest desire is to get married and have children, but cannot do so as Beastmen lack the spiral energy necessary for reproduction. In the epilogue, he becomes the captain of the Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren and an emissary for Earth.</description>

After the timeskip, Gimmy and Darry become important Grapearl pilots, often fighting together. Gimmy tends to be more impulsive and reckless, which sometimes puts the duo in trouble.</description>

Quite knowledgeable, and very flamboyant, Leeron was the first one to join Kamina, Simon, and Yoko on their quest to defeat the Beastmen. He has become the main technician for Team Dai-Gurren, as well as being in charge of coordination and communication between the Gunmen during battle from Dai-Gurren. His ability to learn and adapt is incredibly great, seeing as he once mentioned that he didn`t even know how to read before becoming a mechanic.</description>

<description>The Enki is Viral`s personal Gunman, modelled after an armoured samurai. The Enki is the product of significant innovation in Gunmen technology, and sports a number of advances that eclipse lesser models in performance, and is the first model seen to support solid-based ammunition. Unlike stout Gunmen, such as the Gurren, that have bulky limbs that can only be used in wide swings, the Enki is more segmented and has multiple joints that allow it to perform complex actions, such as throws, kicks, and various martial arts techniques. The Enki`s arm and thigh plates conceal rows of hidden gun turrets that fire large steel projectiles (kunai). There are pop-up compartments in the shoulders that can fire a single volley of rockets, and the entire chest plate can open to reveal a number of launchers that deliver an explosive payload of missiles. The Enki possesses a wrist mounted concave blast-shield, and a helmet with a large black ring atop of it, that is actually the charging focus for a medium-range particle beam cannon.
Its helmet becomes the possession of Simon and Kamina, as they stole it when they first combined to make the Gurren-Lagann.</description>

When wielded, it provides an alternative to the dual swords the Enki usually resorts to in melee combat. Furthermore, it is also capable of shelling from afar by physically launching munitions from the same point on its head, once the sickle has been removed.</description>

<description>The Shuzack currently serves as the personal Gunman of Cytomander. Whereas the Sayrune was best-suited for underwater combat, the Shuzack is more adapted to aerial superiority, sporting a compact flight engine and a massive winged design. Additionally, its multi-jointed frame allows for both arms to both extend and retract in close-quarter situations. Its torso also holds a deadly buzzsaw.
The Shuzack is destroyed, along with its pilot, when it got in the way of the Dai-Gurren ramming into the Dai-Gunten. Like the custom Gunman of the other Generals, the Shuzack can also transform.
However the full extent of its abilities are unknown, as the Shuzack was immediately destroyed following it`s transformation.</description>

<description>The custom Gunmen Gember first appeared in action on the deck of the Dai-Gurren as its owner, Guame, had retreated to it, to personally perform his public warning execution of the captured members of Team Dai-Gurren. It is the second Gunman to feature a transformation. It has the appearance of being rather broad and bulky starfish in its regular mech state and is somewhat insect like with its antennae, which can ensnare enemies. Its second form is a large face-like apparition and is also insect-like with sharp needles that resemble legs. The controls of the Gember differ from normal Gunmen to accommodate its user, as Guame is placed into a sphere-like crevice with a pair of mechanical hands aiding him. The only known attack of the Gember was its Gember Press, wherein the foe is caught in a hold and crushed by the needles that are released from its arms.
The time of the Gember was short lived, as it was destroyed by the Gurren-Lagann`s Giga Drill Break. However, its pilot ejected himself before his Gunman got obliterated.</description>

<description>The Sayrune is currently commissioned as Adiane`s personal Gunman and was first seen deployed from the flagship, Dai-Gunkai, while pursuing the stolen Dai-Gunzan. It is one of the few Gunman seen thus far in the series to feature two unique configurations: its default winged humanoid appearance, as well as an alternate scorpion-shaped layout. While in its winged state, the Sayrune seems to rely mostly on a range of energy whips and tendrils to mount any sort of attack, whereas its scorpion form is endowed with massive pincer claws and a stinger. The Sayrune can also use its wings to form a double-edged weapon called the Bloody Clamper.
The Sayrune was destroyed, along with its pilot, when it was shot by the Dai-Gurren`s cannons at point blank range, after Adiane`s failed attempt to take Nia as a hostage.</description>

<description>The Byakou is Thymilph`s personal Gunman. It is stored within the Dai-Gunzan`s hangar bays and first saw deployment during Team Dai-Gurren`s second attack on the mobile Gunman fortress. Equipped with a polearm called the Alkaid Glaive, it is capable of emitting a powerful energy beam attack from the tip of the weapon, Condemnn Blaze. The Byakou was especially deadly in single combat and proved to be even more lethal, when paired with the Enki in pummeling the lone Gurren. Unlike personal Gunman units fielded by the other Generals, the Byakou was never shown to have a distinct alternate configuration.
The Byakou was the first victim of the Gurren-Lagann`s multi-stage Giga Drill Break attack, which completely obliterated both the Gunmen and its pilot. It was also the last enemy defeated by Kamina, who was heavily wounded and died shortly after.</description>

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>The Dai-Gunkai, rivalling the Dai-Gunzan in terms of sheer bulk and apparently much lengthier, is an aquatic serpentine Gunmen fortress, which served as Adiane`s flagship. Little is known about its abilities, other than its obvious aptitude for sea travel. While it seems to only be able to travel in a body of water, the Dai-Gunkai`s first appearance was marked by a sudden deluge over the battlefield (suggesting that it may have the ability to either divert or even create large volumes of water).
The only appearance of the Dai-Gunkai in combat was in episode 12, when it ambushed the Dai-Gurren, while it was crossing the ocean on its march to the Helix Empire`s capital. Its main weaponry consisted of torpedoes guided by dolphin Beastmen and two massive pincers, which it used on its attempt to drag the Dai-Gurren to the bottom of the ocean. After bringing the Dai-Gurren back to the surface, the Gurren-Lagann obliterated the Dai-Gunkai completely, but Viral, who was commanding the ship at that time, managed to survive.</description>

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>A fortress-type Gunmen, the flying Dai-Gunten is Cytomander`s flagship. The Dai-Gunten made its début during Cytomander`s campaign against the Dai-Gurren, acting primarily as a carrier to launch multiple waves of small aerial Gunmen bombers.
As the battle wore on, Simon and Yoko`s Gurren-Lagann and Viral`s Enkidu found their way deep below its decks and ended up dealing severe internal damage to the ship. Having lost altitude in the process, the Dai-Gunten was eventually damaged by a series of powerful kicks delivered by the Dai-Gurren, which had launched itself into the air using a cliff face. In the process, Team Dai-Gurren managed to snatch one of the enemy airship`s two Levia-Spheres for themselves, and used it to safely float back to the ground, while the Dai-Gunten managed to retreat using the remaining one.
A month after the first confrontation, the Dai-Gunten returns in the following episode along Guame`s flagship, the Dai-Gundo, as Teppelin`s last line of defence against Team Dai-Gurren`s invasion. Its forces managed to trap the Gurren-Lagann, after the rest of the Dai-Gurren`s gunman forces were forced to retreat and protect it against Guame`s offensive, and when the Shuzack was about to finish it, Simon and Rossiu were saved by some unexpected allies who entered the battlefield to aid them. In the end, the Dai-Gunten is sunk once run through by the flying Dai-Gurren. Pieces of its wreckage fell on the Dai-Gundo, provoking a massive explosion, but was unable to damage the heavily armoured flagship.</description>

<description>This fortress-type Gunmen is Guame`s flagship. Its carapace is extraordinarily resilient, as evidenced by its survival of the aerial carrier gunman Dai-Ganten`s impact. It is propelled by many legs on its underside, and can travel at a decent clip. It later combines its strengths with Teppelin to form a whirling tornado of energy that destroys anything that comes in contact and disrupts communications and navigation.
The Gurren-Lagann destroyed the Dai-Gundo from beneath the surface of the earth, piercing its armour and reversing its spinning, violating its union with Teppelin and dissipating its energy storm before lancing it clean through, causing it to explode. The Dai-Gundo`s means of locomotion was later adopted by the humans for the various vehicles they use (cars literally ran on legs, not wheels).</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The Anti-Spiral is the ultimate villain of Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann, and the central antagonistic presence for the final two story arcs. He first appears as a disembodied voice in episode twenty four, but is formally introduced in episode twenty six. His physical form is a chaos of arbitrary human concepts fluctuating on a black silhouette, with cartoonish gestures and exaggerated expressions.
Anti-Spiral is both the leader and collective mental manifestation of the "Anti-Spiral Race" after they seal themselves away to purge their race of Spiral energy. The highly advanced technology bequeaths onto him extensive, almost supernatural powers, which manifest in the form of red energy. With these abilities he is able to manipulate physical and chemical laws (going as far as altering probability), which he does regularly both offensively and as a form of intimidation. The Anti-Spiral is the nemesis of Lordgenome, being responsible for Lordgenome`s madness after explaining the nature of Spiral Nemesis to him.
Beyond what is known of the Anti-Spirals, little is known of the Anti-Spiral personally. He has the mannerisms of a scientist, suggesting he had a hand in both the creation of Anti-Spiral technology and the decision to undergo the millennia-long battle against the Milky Way`s spiral beings. The Anti-Spiral is very proud and holds deep contempt for spiral beings, specifically Simon, frustrated him that across all of time, spiral beings still resist limiting their populations and continue to defy the resolution of his race and their ideology.</description>

<description>Leite Jokin is the chief engineer of Team Dai-Gurren and Leeron`s direct subordinate. She is a skilled and ingenious mechanic, an ideal work partner for the naturally gifted Leeron. Her central duties revolve around maintaining Dai-Gurren`s spiral engine, which appears less technologically sophisticated in Fortress-class Gunmen thus requiring additional fuel beyond spiral energy. Her personal trademarks are her lab coat and a cigarette she holds in her mouth.
In Part III, Leite`s role in the story is expanded from a virtual background character to an important member of the supporting cast. She is married to Makken, who she affectionately calls "Oto-chan" or "Daddy", and the two have three children. Leite and Makken operate a small business servicing mechanical equipment and automotive vehicles, though on occasion they get contracts to develop weapons from the New Government. She and Makken have great faith in Simon and his capacity as a decision maker; their loyalty to him urges them to resist Rossiu by rebuilding the scrapped Gunmen of Team Dai-Gurren, refitting them with spiral weaponry capable of damaging Mugann. Leite also refits Gurren Lagann`s power pack to allow it to reach escape velocity, but opts out of the Battle of Earth to stay with her children on the surface [5]. When Team Dai-Gurren is reformed, she assumes her old post as engineer of the gang`s flagship, the Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren. She eventually ends up as one of the fourteen pilots of Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann, battling Grand Zamboa to both avenge Makken`s death at the hands of Anti-Spiral Kantai and for the freedom of the entire galaxy.</description>
