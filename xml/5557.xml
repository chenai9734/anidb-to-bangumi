<description>* Based on a light novel series by http://anidb.net/cr8725 [Shibamura Jin], illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr6885 [Houden Eizou].
A long time ago, a sacred fox was deified as the guardian of the Mizuchi family. http://anidb.net/ch4435 [Kuugen] the Fox was very wise and it could use various kinds of magic. However, because it was too mischievous, it was sealed into a small shrine in the hill behind the Mizuchi house by a priest.
In the present, http://anidb.net/ch4431 [Takagami Tooru], a Mizuchi descendant, often dreams of a woman who seems like a monster. The head of the Mizuchi household deduces that some sort of danger looms over Tooru, and she releases the sealed Kuugen in order to protect him. Contrary to what Tooru imagines based on the legends, "Kuu-chan", as Kuugen is affectionately referred to, is not a dignified creature. Not only can it turn into a woman of great beauty, but it can also assume the form of a man.

<name>juujin</name>
<description>Kemono, "beast", is a genre of Japanese art and character design that prominently features anthropomorphic animal characters. It is used widely in visual arts, especially drawing and painting, and can be found in many manga, anime, and video game.
Anthropomorphic animal characters in the kemono genre are frequently called juujin, "therianthrope"; the kanji for juujin are also sometimes pronounced kemonobito, "beast-human". While their design differs from artist to artist, they generally employ animal traits considered cute and endearing; most kemono characters retain a fundamentally human personality, however, seldom behaving as the actual animals from which they have been anthropomorphized, and as such they are typically depicted living as humans do.
Juujin leans more on the human-looking side when compared to http://anidb.net/t2857 [anthropomorphism], which leans more on the animal-looking side.

<name>detective</name>
<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<description>Large breasts are breasts a fair notch larger than average, as found in some adolescent girls or fully grown women; however, as anime has no upper limit to breast size, the definition applies somewhat differently. To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<description>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side`s half of the court.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

Many religions have narratives, symbols, traditions and sacred histories that are intended to give meaning to life or to explain the origin of life or the universe. They tend to derive morality, ethics, religious laws or a preferred lifestyle from their ideas about the cosmos and human nature.</description>

<name>Christmas</name>
<description>Christmas, also referred to as Christmas Day, is an annual holiday celebrated on December 25 that commemorates the birth of Jesus of Nazareth. The day marks the beginning of the larger season of Christmastide, which lasts twelve days. The nativity of Jesus, which is the basis for the Anno Domini system of dating, is thought to have occurred between 7 and 2 BC. December 25 is not known to be Jesus` actual date of birth, and the date may have been chosen to correspond with either a Roman festival or the winter solstice.
On the Julian calendar, followed by most Orthodox churches, Christmas Day also falls on O.S. December 25th; this corresponds to N.S. January 7th on the Gregorian calendar, followed by Western churches.
Modern customs of the holiday include gift-giving, Church celebrations, and the display of various decorations—including the Christmas tree, lights, mistletoe, nativity scenes, and holly. Santa Claus (also referred to as Father Christmas, although the two figures have different origins) is a popular mythological figure often associated with bringing gifts at Christmas for children. Santa is generally believed to be the result of a syncretization between Saint Nicholas and elements from pagan Nordic and Christian mythology, and his modern appearance is believed to have originated in 19th century media.
Christmas is celebrated throughout the Christian population, but is also celebrated by many non-Christians as a secular, cultural festival. Because gift-giving and several other aspects of the holiday involve heightened economic activity among both Christians and non-Christians, Christmas has become a major event for many retailers.</description>

<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

<name>important haircut</name>
<description>When a character cuts off his or her hair, it often symbolizes a rite of passage or bout of character growth. A princess striking out on an adventure, or a new recruit at boot camp, for instance. Hair is something that takes time and effort to grow, so parting with it voluntarily can be a powerful act.
This is particularly a big deal when women get haircuts. Yet in fiction, even an accidental hair slicing can leave a character with a surprisingly even cut.
In many religions (Western Christianity, Ancient Egyptian religion, and others) priests and/or monks cut/shave their hair. Roman Catholic nuns also tend to cut and mantain their hair short under their veils when they enter the nunneries. The cutting of one`s own hair is also a part of Buddhist mythology, specifically something done by Siddhartha himself early on in his path to enlightenment, so anime examples might draw from this as an allusion. There are also some cultures, including Native American and many Asians, where a person would cut his or her hair as an act of grief, disgrace, or even rebellion. In the Confucian tradition, hair (like the rest of your body) is considered a gift from your parents and may not be damaged without a very good reason. Furthermore, prisoners and psychiatric patients commonly have their heads shaved, often to prevent the spread of lice, but sometimes also as a demeaning measure.

In some shows, the censorship in the disk releases is even stronger than in the TV version, while others may use creative censorship as a replacement for the removed fan service or even as a joke.
This does not apply to censorship of what Japanese pornography laws still require to be censored.</description>

A common portrayal is that which is conjured by an individual that has been caused great suffering and thereby extracts revenge against the accuser in the form of a curse. This abuser will then have their soul spirited away to hell to suffer endlessly for the rest of eternity.

Defined as the earliest Japanese thoughts of an unified religion, the word Shinto comes from the Chinese hanzi "神道", combining two kanji: "shin" (神), meaning gods or spirits; and "tō" (道), meaning a philosophical path or study.</description>

<name>master-servant relationship</name>
<description>To some genres, this would suggest a genuine pairing where one person exists to serve another person, such as in some action/dramas where the pair becomes united by destiny as partners — fighting or battles between different pairs/partners will usually be a dominant part of the story.
In other genres, this suggests a relationship where one person may be occupied as or even forcefully treated as a servant or slave to the other who designates themself the master — these services usually apply anywhere from tsundere/romantic-comedies to ecchi or to the more extreme in hentai.</description>

<name>catchphrase</name>
<description>A catchphrase is a sound, word or phrase commonly used by a person. That may be simply out of habit, or in an attempt to deliver some form of image, like that of cuteness. In fiction, characters often use catchphrases as a way to deliver specific personality traits. Examples include Otohime Mutsumi`s "ara ara" in Love Hina, Yang Wenli`s "yare yare" in Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Misuzu`s "gao" in AIR, Sakura`s "hoe" in Card Captor Sakura, Suiseiseki`s "desu" in Rozen Maiden, and Ayu`s "uguu" in Kanon (as well as several other characters in the same show).</description>

<name>autumn</name>
<description>Autumn, interchangeably known as fall in the US and Canada, is one of the four temperate seasons. Autumn marks the transition from summer into winter, in September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere), when the arrival of night becomes noticeably earlier and the temperature cools considerably. One of its main features is the shedding of leaves from deciduous trees.

<name>season</name>
<description>A season is a division of the year, marked by changes in weather, ecology, and hours of daylight. Seasons result from the yearly orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth`s rotational axis relative to the plane of the orbit. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth`s surface, variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.
During May, June, and July, the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun. The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December, January, and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere.
In temperate and subpolar regions, four calendar-based seasons (with their adjectives) are generally recognized: spring (vernal), summer (estival), autumn (autumnal), fall and winter (hibernal). Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring (prevernal) and late summer (serotinal) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four.

<name>spring</name>
<description>During spring, the axis of the Earth is increasing its tilt relative to the Sun, and the length of daylight rapidly increases for the relevant hemisphere. The hemisphere begins to warm significantly causing new plant growth to spring forth, giving the season its name. Snow, if a normal part of winter, begins to melt, and streams swell with runoff. Frosts, if a normal part of winter, become less severe. In climates that have no snow and rare frosts, the air and ground temperatures increase more rapidly. Many flowering plants bloom this time of year, in a long succession sometimes beginning when snow is still on the ground, continuing into early summer. In normally snowless areas spring may begin as early as February (Northern Hemisphere) heralded by the blooming of deciduous magnolias, cherries and quince, or August (Southern Hemisphere) in the same way. Many temperate areas have a dry spring, and wet autumn (fall), which brings about flowering in this season more consistent with the need for water as well as warmth. Subarctic areas may not experience spring at all until May or even June.

<description>A fox deity that used to be the Guardian of the Mizuchi family. Kuugen was sealed away by a Water Priest because of her mischievous behaviour. She was released by Noboru after Tooru was targeted by a demon and now serves as their guardian. She can become male or female at any time, but uses the pronoun ore to refer to herself which is usually only used by males in Japan, though in the past females did use the pronoun as well. She attracts a fair bit of attention because of her blonde hair, blue eyes and fox ears, which have to be covered by a hat when out in public, though she can also hide them completely without a hat (they involuntarily pop out if she gets distracted or excited, though).</description>

Tōru, on the other hand, is currently being targeted by Yōkai for the power he possesses. In order to protect him, the Guardian spirit, Kūgen Tenko, is released from the seal that held her captive. Later that night, the enemy attacks and it requires both Kūgen and the sentinel Kō`s combined abilities in order to vanquish the evil spirit. Afterwards, the brothers return home with both Kūgen and Kō, who will both serve as their guardians from spirits who mean to do them harm.

<summary>Kō doubts her capacity to serve as the Mizuchi sentinel after causing several mishaps while trying to help out in the household chores and also after making Tōru feel uneasy by asking him questions regarding his mother. Kūgen then goes out to harvest ingredients for the gourmet dinner that she wants to eat. Tōru also leaves home, rejecting Kō`s offer to accompany him. Noboru finds the disheartened Kō, whom he encourages by explaining that Tōru`s unease stems from his lack of memories about their mother. Kō follows after Tōru to find him ensnared by an Edamame Bean Woman. During the fight, Kō`s face glows from the glowing scales on her face and her dragon race origins are discovered. The Bean Woman unwittingly discloses to Tōru that he was always under the protection of his mother`s spirit. Kūgen arrives to free Tōru from the giant beanstalks, allowing Kō to unleash her full powers against the Yokai.

Meanwhile Noboru is unable to stop worrying about leaving only Kūgen and Kō at home. His preoccupation causes him to lose a badminton game and prevents him from noticing that his classmate, Sakura, has already asked him out on a date. Kūgen then arrives in school and starts participating in the different club`s activities. While chasing after Kūgen, Noboru and Sakura are attacked by three Earth Spectres. Kūgen arrives at the scene and rescues Noboru using wood techniques such as "Humongous Tree Branches" and "A Tornado of Sakura Petals". After the fight, Kūgen seals Sakura`s memory of the incident.

<summary>After getting permission from Noboru and Tōru`s father, Kūgen and Kō are allowed to stay in their house. Kūgen shifts into his male form and asks Noboru to bring him to the town`s Shinto shrine, in accordance to the custom where a spirit has to ask permission from the local god before using his powers. They discover that the owner of the local convenience store is the local god, Ebisu, who serves as the patron of merchants. After accompanying Ebisu to the shrine, Ebisu orders his shrine`s gatekeepers—a pair of imperial guardian lions named Kōga and Eiga to attack Kūgen`s group. A battle then ensues which Kūgen wins after "summoning Shin" from the sky. Ebisu then explains that he was only trying to destroy his temple to attract more business. Ebisu also tells Kūgen in private that Miyako`s spirit still haunts the land.

<summary>Kūgen notices that Tōru also has the same scar that Miyako once had. This spurs Kūgen to perform a taboo ritual that will allow the bridge between the mortal and the spirit realm to be opened. During the dance-like ritual, Ebisu arrives and commands Kūgen to discontinue the rite, otherwise he will have to enforce the necessary punishment. Kūgen attempts to fight Ebisu, but he threatens to harm the brothers. Kūgen surrenders and allows her hair to be cut off in return for forgiveness. Afterwards, Tōru meets his mother as a spirit for the first time, however she cannot be seen by Noboru. Miyako remarks that she and Tōru are alike before she departs for the afterlife. Back in his convenience store, Ebisu is delighted that he can now sell bracelets created from Kūgen`s hair.

<summary>On the way home from school, Noboru and Sakura stop by a bookstore where they meet up with Kou and Kuugen. On discovering that Kou came there to get a book by which she could teach herself to cook, Sakura invites herself over to Noboru`s place by offering to teach her. Kuugen is bribed by the offer of a homemade chocolate cake. Later when Sakura drops by, Kuugen manages to disrupt the entire cooking process by coating the entire kitchen with cocoa as a part of her research into the chocolate cake`s ingredients. To placate the tantrum throwing Kuugen, who still wants to eat cake, Sakura offers to take to the girls to an all-you-can-eat cake buffet. At the buffet, while Kuugen eats herself to distraction, Sakura and Kou get to know each other better. On the way home, they meet the Takagami brothers who have managed to attract the attention of a few low level Book-dwelling Spirits. Kuugen promptly vanquishes them and once again seals Sakura`s memory, but someone else has been watching Kuugen`s display of power from the sidelines.

<summary>A father and son pair of foxes come to pay Kuugen a visit, and ask for her help because their home in the mountains has been destroyed by humans. Kuugen asks Noboru to allow them to stay for a while. As the two lack names, She names the baby fox "Daigoro", and the father by implication is named "Ogami Ittō". Later Ogami helps Kou in her battle against a Clam Spirit who is targeting Tōru. The gatekeepers from Ebisu`s shrine show up to claim the clam. It is explained that the clam is on the run from the neighboring area`s deity, Mubyōu, from whom it had stolen a treasured artifact. The reward promised by the famously violent Mubyōu for the return of the clam is the spiritual rights to a piece of land. Kuugen and Noboru manage to blackmail the gatekeeper spirits into letting Ogami keep the clam, and thus Ogami gains a home for himself and Daigoro from Mubyōu.

<summary>The Akagi District deity, Mubyōu, is looking for the Reverse Circle. She asks for the help of Tōru and Kuugen. Kuugen agrees to help only because Tōru asked her to. Mubyōu said the clam did not know anything except that the clam`s partner, a raccoon, knows where it is. After getting Tōru into the Akagi High School, Mubyōu reveals she was told it was in Tōru`s head. However, before Mubyōu can open Tōru`s head, what seems to be Ogami saves Tōru and takes him to the rooftop. Ogami acts strangely, and Daigoro reveals it is not his father. Kuugen attacks "Ogami" and it changes back into its true form, a raccoon. Noboru finds Ogami unconscious in the school. Tōru realizes the thing around Daigoro is actually the Reverse Circle, but Kuugen cuts him off before he is able to tell Mubyōu. A fight ensues between Mubyōu and Kuugen. Kuugen wins the fight and it appears as though she is about to kill Mubyōu, but Tōru stops her and gives Mubyōu the Reverse Circle.

<summary>This episode begins with Mubyou running from an unknown attacker who is wearing an owl mask that much resembles a raccoon and a black cloak and is asking for the Reverse Circle (Also known as Sakasaen). The attacker uses a weapon that resembles blue wire. Mubyou, in a desperate effort to get away, throws out the brown wolf puppet which transforms into a guardian wolf, which the attacker shreds into small pieces. The next day, the Owl-Masked Figure meets Kou outside the house where she asks to meet with the Head of the Miduchi. During the meeting, the cloaked figure reveals that she is the god of a nearby land and that the Sakasaen is a treasure of her land which belongs to her, not Mubyou. Kuu agrees to help this god find Mubyou and help take back the Reverse Circle; they believe she fled to Suzunose. After an unsuccessful day of searching, Kuu and the Owl-Masked God battle one-on-one. Kuu gives Toru a green bracelet which resembles the one made from her hair. Noboru and Kou spend their evening at a park setting off fireworks; Kou blesses cursed men and receives alcohol in return. Mubyou tricks Toru into following her away from Kuu and puts the Reverse Circle around his neck. Kou is shown drunk at the end of this episode.

<summary>The Owl Mask is smashed and falls to the ground revealing this god to have the same face as Mubyou. She explains that she is the real Mubyou, and that the other Mubyou has the same face as she does. When Kuugen runs to the aid of Toru, the copy Mubyou threatens that Toru will be engulfed in flames from the Sakasaen. Kuu taunts her to try it; however, when the copy Mubyou sets the fire on Toru, the flames are reversed and set her alight instead. Kuu reveals that the reason this happened was because of the mirror enchantment she had placed on the green bracelet which she had given to Toru. Mubyou is revealed as a living doll modeled to resemble the true Mubyou. Mubyou gives the Mubyou-doll her cloak and tells Kuugen that she looks forward to when they will meet again in eight years. Kou is shown running after the spirit dragon which left her. The next day, Mubyou gives Kou the Reverse Circle and departs.

<summary>Kou accidentally breaks a window and is determined to pay for it herself, (as well as the for dishes she has been breaking). She turns to Misaki for advice, and Misaki suggests that getting a part-time job would be the best thing in order to pay for repairs to the window. Kou`s first job is at the tea shop, where Kuu tags along for fun. Kou is fired for breaking many of the dishes, and Kuu is fired for yelling at the customers and eating a lot of food during work. They get new jobs at Domo Burgers, where many girls line up just to order from Kuu in her male form. Kou gets fired for preparing food poorly, while Kuu is fired for flirting. They both get jobs at Ebisu`s market delivering pizzas. Kou gets lost and cannot find the delivery address; Kuu delivers pizza by throwing them on customers` doorsteps without obtaining payment - and those are all promptly stolen by a cat-demon who is a fan of Kuu. Kou and Kuu are fired once again.

Meanwhile, Noboru and Kou are cooking. Kuu learns that one of the agents she is following around is Tsukuyomi, the one who sealed her. Kuu comes to a decision that the agents want to seal Shiro, due to her pale white skin, (white symbolizes the clouds, and is therefore a sign of rebellion against the gods because clouds cover the symbol of the gods, the sun), and that Shiro was in the Land of the Gods. So they leave Kuu behind, telling her not to interfere. Noboru and Kou go in search of Tooru now that they know he is missing, and Tooru and Shiro meet up with Sakura, and the Oni appear to take Shiro with the new familiar, Dema, which they have purchased.
