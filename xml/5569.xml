<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="291170">ur a nuub if u dont watch it !!! xD</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="192506">a beautiful story, abeit a bit chessy at times.  give it a watch, u might end up loving it :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="391848">Two stories of romance set in a relatively large world, with a plot that puts colorful characters on an adventure, seeking clues to a promising mystery, through a troubled era, in an Disney-esque and family friendly manner. Along the way, they also discover clues to other "mysteries" that change their lives.

You can relate to the meek, but intelligent/book smart main character, who gets dragged into a wild adventure by a charming childhood friend, Allison, who relies on that wit and thoughtfulness of his to support her ambitious "plans". They rely on their combo of complimentary abilities to get them through hairy situations. Their compatibility leads to a stronger relationship that turns romantic.

The second story is sort of like a sequel, which follows their daughter, Lillia. It has some elements of mystery, adventure, and romance, but seems to focus more on morals and ideals.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="273852">A really great show, a must watch for any romance/adventure fans.  There are no annoying love triangles and no harem either, just pure adventure with a pinch of romance, sprinkled with a dash of comedy.  Anyway, don`t take my word for it, take a look yourself.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="397570">The first half is absolutely wonderful. 
In the second half the story gets pretty thin but it`s still entertaining.

Overall pretty good.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="477606">Even though the story more or less likely a unrefined gem,
Is still great watched for change pace once in a while.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="308351">A brilliant story (actually two) turned into a brilliant animated show.</recommendation>

<description>The military, also known as the armed forces, are forces authorized and legally entitled to use deadly force so as to support the interests of the state and its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its citizens and the prosecution of war against foreign powers. The military may also have additional functions within a society, including construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding critical areas.

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>air force</name>
<description>An air force, also known in some countries as an air army or air corps, is in the broadest sense, the national military organization that primarily conducts aerial warfare. More specifically, it is the branch of a nation`s armed services that is responsible for aerial warfare as distinct from an army, navy or other branch. Typically, air forces are responsible for gaining control of the air, carrying out strategic-bombing missions and providing support to surface forces.
The term "air force" may also refer to a tactical air force or numbered air force, which is an operational formation within a national air force. Air forces typically consist of a combination of fighters, bombers, helicopters, transport planes and other aircraft.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>An anime that takes place in an alternative past is an anime that clearly does not belong to the future or the present, and isn`t tied particularly closely to our history, or has ties to our history but only as a premise: there are too many things that don`t make sense for the time-period. In some cases there is futuristic technology present, but the overall setting still feels that of the past. However the setting must still take place on Earth, since we can not know if the history of a fantasy world is an alternate one or not.</description>

<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<description>The conspiracy thriller (or paranoid thriller) is a sub-genre of the thriller which flourished in the 1970s in the US (and was echoed in other parts of the world) in the wake of a number of high-profile scandals and controversies (most notably Vietnam, the assassination of President Kennedy, Chappaquiddick and Watergate), and which exposed what many people regarded as the clandestine machinations and conspiracies beneath the orderly fabric of political life.
The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top".</description>

<name>Wilhelm Schultz</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Allison`s childhood friend, and the second protagonist of the series` first part. A scholar who has the ability to memorize things instantly and also is skilled at firearms. Wil does not share Allison`s sense for adventure, but is usually dragged along by her. While Allison is physically more apt and spontaneous than he is, Wilhelm brings in the level-headedness and wits during their adventures.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Lillia is the main female protagonist of the series` second part. She is Allison`s and Wil`s daughter, but is kept ignorant of Travas` true identity as Wil. She knows almost nothing about Treize and does not know that he is the Prince of Ikstova. She is shy of being called by her full name, Lilliane Acacia Corazón Whittington Schultz. She is, as her mother mutters in a monologue, as dense as Wilhelm when it comes to romance.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Travas is a Major in the Sou Beil armed forces, stationed in Roxche as a diplomatic liaison. He is involved in a relationship with Allison, who addresses him as her boyfriend. Travas is, in fact, Wilhelm Schultz. He knows of Treize`s royal heritage and speaks to him with the appropriate politeness behind Lillia`s back.</description>

<name>Treize</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Treize is the son and one of the fraternal twin children of Carr Benedict and Fiona, and Lillia`s closest friend. Looks to form a relationship with Lillia similar to that which Allison and Wil had in their younger days. Being a son of Fiona, he is also the Prince of Ikstova, though Lillia is unaware of this and only sees him as a childhood friend. He is worldly and does not really care for his royal heritage, and wishes that he can be like a normal civilian, and not be a subject to political favors among royal families.</description>
