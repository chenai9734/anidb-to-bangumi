<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="346924">For me, as someone who loved the original series, these 3 OVAs are quite the disappointment... 
I don`t know what the production team was thinking when they decided to ruin such a great series by something which can only be described as letting one of the producer`s 15 years old kid write the plot for the 3 OVAs... Its terrible, I actually felt the urge to turn it off, but only my love to the series prevented me from doing so,
For fans ONLY. If you want the real deal, watch the original series, not the OVAs...
____________
Edit: almost 2 years later, after the rest of OVAs were released and I watched them - I must admit that from the 4th OVA and on, the series gained back its pace and resembled the original Kenichi I liked, so now, I`m patiently waiting for it to continue. I have a feeling it`s going to be very good. Recommended!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="305778">for fans of the genre &amp; the original TV series there is good animation goes along with 2012 while keeping the main aspects of the original , a good comedy &amp; plenty of nice action (some may be cheesy) I hope it`s an introduction to a sequel anyway over all very enjoyable</recommendation>

Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>school life</name>
<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

She is also a master of all types of weapons and believes that weaponry should be seen as an extension of the body: simply relying on the weapons strength alone will not make you a master of it. She was initially viewed as a loner, often avoiding interaction with the other residents of the dojo, besides Apachai. However, later in the series, she begins to open up to Ken`ichi and the others, and even partakes in certain daily rituals (e.g. dinner) with them. She teaches Ken`ichi how to use weapons and also got him past his fear of people using weapons against him.</description>

His kicks have speeds that are still a blur even when viewing a replay of it at 1/1000 of the normal speed. If necessary, he is able to intimidate the other masters in order to maintain peace. Even using just 0.0002% of his power, he can easily overwhelm both Ken`ichi and Miu at the same time and rip a tree in half.</description>

<description>Niijima Haruo is a member of the Newspaper Club and investigates everyone. Niijima dreams of eventually ruling the world and formed the Alliance for that purpose. He has a broad range of expertise, including stealth, lock picking, tinkering and programming; he once constructed rudimentary traps while he was simultaneously running around an arena at high speed. He is very adept at dodging attacks and running away. Despite his cowardly tactics, he has shown himself to be a cunning individual and a skilled tactician. If forced to battle, Niijima relies on hit-and-run and psychological tactics to un-nerve his opponents and render them more vulnerable. His is so skilled, that both friend and enemy have complimented him. Many times throughout the series, Niijima appears to use Ken`ichi as a tool, but then later displays a random and sometimes irksome act of kindness, making Ken`ichi question their "friendship" from time to time. In the beginning of the series, Niijima is constantly bullying Ken`ichi, calling him names and setting him up with other bullies, but over time, as Ken`ichi becomes stronger, Niijima seems to attach himself to Ken`ichi, considering himself to be his "best friend". He constantly relies on Ken`ichi to get him out of danger, and tells the members of the Shinpaku alliance that he has always had Ken`ichi`s back and has never let him down, leading them to believe he is a kind and selfless leader.
His senses are superhumanly acute, he is able to "scan" individuals by observing them for a few seconds, learning a wide variety of physical, mental, emotional, and other information about them.</description>

<charactertype id="3">Organization</charactertype>
<description>The Shinpaku Rengou is a group of fighters created by Niijima Haruo in order to facilitate his goal of world domination. The name comes from the first characters in Niijima (新) and Shirahama (白). The alliance is first introduced in episode 21 of the anime, when Niijima comes to Ken`ichi`s rescue in his fight against Kisara`s group. The Alliance is composed mostly of students from Kouryou High and converted former members of Ragnarok. Following Odin`s defeat and the subsequent dissolution of Ragnarok, the Shinpaku Alliance is able to cement its reputation as the strongest fighter group in town.
In the YOMI arc, the Shinpaku Alliance participates in the D of D Tournament and manages to reach the final round of the Chi group. However, because of the injuries sustained by its core fighter members throughout the tournament and their final opponent being Shou Kanou, the Alliance chooses to forfeit the match.
The Alliance initially used Kouryou High`s physics laboratory as a make-shift base, but as the organization grew, it moved to Kisara`s former base. After the D of D tournament, Niijima officially rented the building, telling Kisara`s dad that they were trying to save her from the world of delinquents.
Yami and YOMI consider the Shinpaku Alliance part of Ryouzanpaku.</description>

<description>The Ryouzanpaku Dojo is home to elite fighters who specialize in different styles of martial arts. The dojo is famous for its powerful members and is challenged by other dojos and fighters so often that it charges its challengers and has a waiting list. Despite this, the dojo lacks money, during the YOMI arc it goes bankrupt.
Although they are all immeasurably powerful, the masters of Ryouzanpaku are also very eccentric and prone to immature behavior. They have trouble interacting with normal people, mainly because they unconsciously release massive amounts of ki, which sometimes makes the people they encounter feel nauseated. They are lazy procrastinators - only Ma and Kouetsuji are shown to bring in any steady income, while Apachai and Shigure have childish tendencies.</description>
