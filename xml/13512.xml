<description>http://anidb.net/ch1806 [Natsume] has been busy, navigating between humans and Yokai when he coincidentally reunites with an old classmate, Yuki. The reunion brings back painful memories of a certain Yokai. Meanwhile, Natsume also becomes acquainted with http://anidb.net/ch96733 [Tsumura Yorie], a woman in the memories of a Yokai whose name Natsume had returned. Yorie knows much about http://anidb.net/ch1808 [Reiko], and now lives a peaceful life with her only son, http://anidb.net/ch96734 [Mukuo]. Interacting with this family is comforting for Natsume, but a mysterious Yokai has been lurking in their town.
On the way back from investigating, a "Yokai seed" that had latched itself to http://anidb.net/ch1807 [Nyanko-Sensei] drops into the Fujiwara Family’s garden and grows overnight into a fruit tree. When Nyanko-Sensei eats a fruit that is somewhat shaped like himself, he suddenly splits into three!

<name>Natsume Takashi</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The main character of the story. Like his grandmother, http://anidb.net/ch1808 [Natsume Reiko], Takashi has the ability to see spirits. He has inherited the Book of Friends, a book of names that no one but Reiko, Takashi, and other spirits can read. Because of Takashi`s strong resemblance to Reiko, he is often mistaken for her, causing spirits who hate Reiko to chase him constantly. He decided to dissolve the Book by giving all the names back to their owners. He is accompanied by the spirit http://anidb.net/ch10380 [Madara], nicknamed "Cat" because of the spirit`s appearance, and has promised that to pass the book on to Cat when he dies.</description>

<name>Nyanko-sensei</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A mysterious feline spirit. Madara was sealed in to a shrine, before accidentally getting released by Natsume. Because he was trapped for so long, Madara has shaped in to a "fortune cat" or manekineko, leading Natsume to nickname him Cat. In this form, other people could see him, leading for Natsume having to ask his guardians if he could keep him. He is a powerful spirit, who protects Natsume from others, and teaches him spells on occasion. They often fight each other, which leads to Natsume punching Madara on the face and knocking him out. Despite his protests of not being a cat, he likes to play with cat toys. Natsume is more respectful to Madara in the anime, calling him "nyanko-sensei" (master cat). Natsume has promised the Book of Friends to him when he dies.</description>

<name>Natsume Reiko</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Natsume`s grandmother, from whom he inherited the ability to see spirits. When Reiko was young, she was considered a freak by everyone else because of her ability. Since she believed no human could ever understand her, she turned to the spirits for companionship. Reiko`s power was extraordinarily powerful, and so she bullied spirits in to obeying her by playing games with them. If they lost, she would make them give her their names. Reiko gathered the names in to the Book of Friends, and commanded most spirits, except for Madara, who beat her in a game. Reiko died when she was young, so no one remembered her.</description>
