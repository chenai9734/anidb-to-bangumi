<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>A robot is an automatically guided machine, able to do tasks on its own. Another common characteristic is that by its appearance or movements, a robot often conveys a sense that it has intent or agency of its own.

<name>content indicators</name>
<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

See Androids, Piloted Robots, Power Suits, Robot Helpers, Transforming Robots for a more specific classification.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>The GM - pronounced "Jim" - is a mass-produced version of the RX-78 Gundam, introduced just before the end of the war. In order to reduce its cost, the GM omits the Gundam`s expensive Luna Titanium armor, Core Block system, and spare beam saber, and substitutes a short-range beam spray gun for the Gundam`s beam rifle. Still, it`s an effective close-combat mobile suit, and in the final campaigns of the war the GM turns the tide in favor of the Federation Forces.</description>

These inexpensive vehicles, based on civilian space pods, were created to provide fire support for the Federation Forces` GM mobile suits.

<description>The Zaku I is the original incarnation of the Zaku, produced a few years before the start of the war. Now considered obsolete, it`s used only by non-combat units like the supply corps. One of these primitive Zakus is assigned to Lieutenant Gadem`s Papua-class supply ship, and the old veteran recklessly takes it into battle against the Gundam.</description>

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>With the development of the MS-14 Gelgoog far behind schedule, the Zeon military decided to adapt the land warfare mobile suit Dom for space combat. The result is the Rick Dom, in which the jet engines that give the Dom its hovering capabilities are replaced by rockets. Otherwise, it`s basically the same as the land version - a fast, heavily-armoured mobile suit armed with a devastating bazooka. By the end of the war, the Rick Dom has all but replaced the Zaku II in the ranks of Zeon`s space forces.</description>

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>With the Gelgoog, the Principality of Zeon at last creates a mobile suit to rival the Earth Federation`s Gundam. The Gelgoog boasts high performance and sturdy armor like that of the Rick Dom, but it`s also equipped with powerful beam weapons. Although it`s the best mass-produced mobile suit to appear in the war, the Gelgoog arrives too late to change the course of the conflict, and due to Zeon`s manpower shortage it`s piloted mostly by inexperienced trainees.</description>
