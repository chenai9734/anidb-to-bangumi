<description>Cooking — http://anidb.net/ch23268 [Mayuri] and http://anidb.net/ch23271 [Kurisu] attempt to make some fried chicken with the help of a cognitive computing-based http://anidb.net/ch71327 [Upa] terminal, only to find they lack the actual ingredients they need. Thus, with Upa`s help, they find something they can make with what they have in the lab.
Navigation — After http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe] and Kurisu get into an argument with each other, they both use Upa to try and navigate their way home without bumping into each other. Instead, Upa arranges them to take the long route so they can make up with each other.
Fashion — When it becomes apparent that Okabe and http://anidb.net/ch23269 [Daru] pretty much wear the same clothes all the time, Kurisu uses Upa to try and come up with some different outfits for them based on their hobbies and personalities.
Meeting — Following complaints from http://anidb.net/ch30857 [Mr. Braun], Upa heads up a meeting concerning a potential new location for the lab, much to Okabe`s dismay.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>visual novel</name>
<description>The two terms are similar yet different, however, the fact that they look and `feel` the same outweighs the technical differences. For clarification, visual novels are considered a sub-genre of adventure games and the term does not cover simulations. While the two genres often share a common visual presentation, dating sims are sometimes considered to be more statistically based than the "choose your own adventure" style of visual novels; basically, the choices you make might change something else than just the story arc (or your next porn pic). Dating sims can involve several technical elements such as a time limit, several statistics such as looks and charm which can be boosted through exercise, or an "attraction meter" which can increase or decrease depending on one`s decisions.</description>

<description>Asia is Earth`s largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometers, about 30% of Earth`s total land area and 8.7% of the Earth`s total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

<description>Engrish is actually a mispronunciation of English, as can be the result of someone, who does not have English as their primary language of origin (such as Japanese or Chinese). Occasionally characters in the original Japanese dialogue version of an anime will speak in English... however; this often still requires the assistance of subtitles, for while the words are meant to be said in English, the sentence structure and letter pronunciation may still be strongly related to the person’s primary language.</description>

<name>just as planned</name>
<description>A term usually used to describe a situation, where a seemingly smart and cunning villain sets up a plan that seems grand and impressive, but is actually long winding, ridiculous, and convoluted. And all of that just to trick his opponent(s), like the hero or anybody else, into doing things exactly as he planned. Suffice to say that the villain could have reached his goal by much shorter and easier means, it just wouldn`t seem as awesome anymore.
The phrase is also known as the original Japanese "keikaku doori" where keikaku stands translated for "plan" or "schedule", and doori for "in accordance with ..." or "following ...".
The phrase is a reference to http://anidb.net/ch301 [Yagami Light] from http://anidb.net/a4563 [Death Note], and his love for plans.</description>

<description>An episodic anime consists of many successive short arcs that are generally 1-2 episodes in length, with strong plot continuity within each arc but generally little continuity from one arc to the next. For long shows (well upwards of 50 episodes), the episode count constraint is less tight; for example, a show with close to 250 episodes would also be considered episodic if it consisted of a majority of arcs of up to 3 or maybe 4 episodes and possibly also very few slightly longer arcs.</description>

Often calls himself "Hououin Kyouma" (鳳凰院凶真).
Mayuri and Daru just call him "Okarin" (オカリン), abbreviated after his name.
The phrase he uses to end conversations, particularly with himself, is "El Psy Kongroo"

Plenty of statements he makes could be taken as sexual harassment. He and Rintarou have known each other since high school. Usually turns down Rintarou`s ridiculous requests as "annoying", but in truth gets them done in proper order. However, he trusts Rintarou as a friend. Has great confidence in his programming and hacking abilities (he doesn`t mind being called a Super Hacker, but doesn`t like it when people call him Super Haker). He`s always in front of the computer.
Has the nickname "Daru" (ダル), abbreviated after his name.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A research member in Victor Qondria University`s Brain Research Program (age group matches that of third-year high school, but skipped a grade through America`s educational system). She is famous in America for writing thesis papers, part of which is covered in the news. Thanks to skipping a grade in America as a girl, she was envied by people around her, and ended up building a strong personality. She doesn`t like to show weakness to others and so she always has a stern expression. However, she is very curious and when she builds interest she pokes into things. Occassionally has views that differ from regular opinion, like, "The experiment data is more important than the subject`s privacy." Rintarou often tells her, "Hey, you`ve got a pretty good sense of being a Mad Scientist", but she`s not one to agree to such things personally.
Rintarou has given her plenty of nicknames, in particular "Christina" (クリスティーナ) and "Assistant" (助手).</description>

<description>A girl that really likes riding bicycles, and is quite energetic, though a little crude. If you stick around her, she`s surprisingly cautious. Very helpful. A little too familiar with things, but doesn`t dig too deep. Not quite comfortable with having other people help her. For that reason, she spends as little time as possible. Her personality drastically changes when it comes to her own interests. Proactive. Has a habit of using strange and difficult vocabulary at times, but somehow you can tell she`s purposely doing so. Ended up hanging out with the Future Gadget Laboratory since she started working at the CRT TV Workshop.</description>
