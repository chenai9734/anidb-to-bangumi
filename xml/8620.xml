<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="333496">Fair enough, except for the brooding-five-episodes-over-problems-and-then-fixing-them-in-two-minutes part. Characters are well-developed and interesting to watch, except for the two main ones, who are pretty self-centered and typically indecisive... Mushy and lot of repetition towards the end. 
Good animation and nice use of soft colours :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="736643">I feel anidb should introduce a new tag "sudden potential girlfriend appearance" or "sudden girl appearance who later become girlfriend" and add that tag to this anime. In some sense, this anime repackaged Hollywood classic "Roman Holiday". A fast paced story and a couple of comic scenes make it watchable. Give it a try if you are not tired of school romance/love polygon.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="620834">I like this series at least 10x better than Onegai teacher. Maybe it`s just my taste but the whole teacher/student relationship just does not click for me. Also, while the main couple in Onegai looks like mother and son to me Ichika and Kaito at least look cute together. The character development is also more subtle and realistic I think. The rest of the cast is also more likeable and has more depth. Maybe I just got into anime too late and couldn`t handle the greatness of Onegai?</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="533332">This anime is perfect. I loved the characters, the setting, the story, and everything else!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="402218">Fully recommended for any good anime fan, good development of characters and overdone the job of spiritual sequel of Onegai Teacher.
For the ones who think the final was bittersweet pay plenty attention to the lines of Remon when she gives the film roll and the suit Kaito receives from her sister to send Ichika, as well what she`s wearing at the Movie exhibition of the movie at the end.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="63560">An homage to  Onegai Teacher that IMO surpasses the original. I particularly liked the main character Kaito in this anime much more then his counterpart Kei  in  Onegai Teacher also the Remon character was better. This anime had a much more interesting story and at least a few good laughs.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="264842">Add 2 parts Toradora 1 part Ano Hana 1 part Suzumiya . Shake well . Serve with sprinkled aliens on top.

Funny high grade animation. If you`re only going to watch one series this season , this should be it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="445819">*will update as season goes on*
From the first two episodes this is fast becoming one of my favorites from this season, if not my favorite.  I noticed the Onegai Sensei character similarities from the start, but thinking back on the stories they feel very different.

So far this has certainly been a fun show to watch and I`m looking forward to future episodes.

Don`t get hung up on looking for the next masterpiece in every show, throw out any "checklists" you`ve come up with comparing it to past works, and enjoy it at face value.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="466955">Despite having a bittersweet ending, it was worth watching. If you want a romantic anime with aliens, give this anime a try.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="430063">If the author is the same person as Onegai Sensei / Twin but he changes his name, I can`t say this is a rip-off.

Overall is good but not the best. The story has slow pace in the start but surprising in the end.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="548153">Definitely not as good as Onegai Teacher but it has a bit more action in the scenario, still a good series - recommended for romance, drama fans if they already watched Onegai Teacher! ;)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="157861">A great, feel good romance. All the characters were likable and watching them was a lot of fun. I would love a sequel simply to spend more time with them.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="267227">Onegai Teacher!? or rather Onegai Senpai. haha</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="78231">Having seen the first episode, it`s pretty easy to peg this one:  Onegai Sensei for Dummies.  

One of the terrible `moe` shows that started it all has apparently passed far enough from the short attention span of anime fans to be regurgitated with some minor changes.  This time around the big-breasted space alien girl who saves our worthless protagonist is a fellow student instead of a teacher.  Our `hero` is still a useless and clueless putz, with girls interested in him for no apparent reason though.  This show has decent artwork but is otherwise terrible.  If you love simplistic, contrived romantic conflict and all the standard cliches - bath scenes, swimsuit scenes, etc this show will surely run through them like a checklist, as it did in the first episode.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="524807">Decent romance anime with a nice dose of comedy. Up until now, every episode always ends with a cliffhanger (more or less), which makes waiting for the next episode a pain. :D
Go give it a try, especially for people who know OnegaiTeacher.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="60847">Must see, if you like School life/Romance.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="522144">Simply a comedy-romance between tsundere alien and very-normal human boy...
If you ever watched (and loved) Ano Hana or Onegai Teacher, you must watch it...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="530122">If you like romance, without a perverted guy, with the typical touch of fantasy/sci fi. THIS IS A MUST SEE. Seriously, it did surprise me, I never expect it to be so good, the dialogues, the complex but possible love polygon and the conclusion. Better than onegai teacher. 9/10</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="261826">First of all don`t bother about the low rating of this series, it`s not the rating/score that can tell if the anime is really that good, it`s still from yourself and your own perspective. Just look at several anime blog and anime forums like asuki and that can tell you how popular and good this anime really is.

Hands down for the "most painful to wait for the next episode" winter 2012 series &amp;gt;_&amp;lt;.. Yes lots of cliches, same settings like your other typical harem romance anime, but execution and the direction, is quite a top notch. As of now, or maybe till the end of winter, it`s the best anime of winter 2012.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="516486">I began to watch Ano Natsu de Matteru without watching Onegai Teacher. After reading the recommendations i just had to see it.

They have a lot in common, BUT de development of Ano Natsu does not seem so forced to me as was Onegai teacher.

In this anime you can see just how the feeling of the characters develops in an awesome way, and the love triangle is just awesome and funny. Honestly in Onegai Teacher i didn`t see this.

Both anime are grate, have their own beauty and are worth watching. I dont know why the votes are so low, cos in 2 episodes you`re already trapped. Is not like i`ve already watched Onegai Teacher, i know where this is going. NOT. 

Just in My Opinion. Sorry for the bad English.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="437695">Besides the crew it is far better than onegai sensei</recommendation>

<description>When a group of friends decide to make a movie during a long summer holiday, they end up learning a little about film-making and a lot more about each other and themselves. What begins as a simple way to avoid the summer doldrums quickly turns into something much more complex, intimate and revealing, as the maturing relationships between the members of the young cast take on new, and sometimes very unexpected, turns...

<name>swimsuit</name>
<description>A swimsuit is one of several kinds of garments designed to be worn by people engaging in water-based activities or sports or during certain activities under sunlight. Most kinds of swimsuit reveal a large portion of the body surface area, but exceptions exist. The more revealing kinds may also be worn as undergarment in sports that require wetsuits, or when there is a need to display the body, as in the case of beauty pageants or bodybuilding contests.
There is a very wide range of styles of modern swimsuits, which vary in relation to body coverage and materials. The choice of style of swimsuit is dependent on current fashions, community standards of modesty, and plain personal preference. Swimsuits for men usually expose the chest, while those for women do not usually do so; however, many women prefer to engage in water or sun activities with their torso uncovered, in a practice commonly described as toplessness or topfreedom. Since the early twentieth century a naturist movement has developed in western countries that seeks a return to non-sexual nakedness when swimming and during other appropriate activities; in some places around the world, nude beaches have been set aside for people who choose to engage in normal beach activities in the nude, and such beaches may or may not enforce nudity onto their goers.
In anime, it is common for at least one episode to feature the characters in swimsuits, usually as an excuse for gratuitous fanservice; when that happens, the episode is usually labeled a pool or beach episode, after the place the characters went to. Swimsuits, and in particular one-piece swimsuits, are a very common fetish in Japan; while the reason for that is uncertain, a common folk explanation is the fact that boys throughout their entire adolescence are commonly exposed to their female classmates wearing them, in what might be called an experiment in sexual discovery waiting to happen.</description>

<name>school swimsuit</name>
<description>A school swimsuit (also known as sukumizu, shorthand for school mizugi) is a standardised navy blue one-piece swimsuit worn by schoolgirls. Typically they also have a name tag on the front. Sukumizu can also be black or white.
Normally worn at schools though sometimes also worn at beaches when the character feels this to be easier, forgot to buy a normal swimsuit of their own or wants to give some fan service to those that like school swimsuits better than regular swimsuits.
In http://anidb.net/t2856 [ecchi] anime, a swimsuit of this type sometimes serves censoring purposes when characters take a bath. If there is a group of female characters donning swimsuits, you can expect the youngest or youngest-looking girl to wear one of these.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots.

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

<name>important haircut</name>
<description>When a character cuts off his or her hair, it often symbolizes a rite of passage or bout of character growth. A princess striking out on an adventure, or a new recruit at boot camp, for instance. Hair is something that takes time and effort to grow, so parting with it voluntarily can be a powerful act.
This is particularly a big deal when women get haircuts. Yet in fiction, even an accidental hair slicing can leave a character with a surprisingly even cut.
In many religions (Western Christianity, Ancient Egyptian religion, and others) priests and/or monks cut/shave their hair. Roman Catholic nuns also tend to cut and mantain their hair short under their veils when they enter the nunneries. The cutting of one`s own hair is also a part of Buddhist mythology, specifically something done by Siddhartha himself early on in his path to enlightenment, so anime examples might draw from this as an allusion. There are also some cultures, including Native American and many Asians, where a person would cut his or her hair as an act of grief, disgrace, or even rebellion. In the Confucian tradition, hair (like the rest of your body) is considered a gift from your parents and may not be damaged without a very good reason. Furthermore, prisoners and psychiatric patients commonly have their heads shaved, often to prevent the spread of lice, but sometimes also as a demeaning measure.

<description>Usually girly tears are the ones not shed by men (duh). 
Like when a (stereotypical) girl watches something and cries her makeup out, a (stereotypical) dude just says, proclaiming his masculinity: "Meh, yet another soap opera bulls..t, I`ll be in my garage fixing my ride while playing heavy metal on a burning guitar ...with my teeth! And where`s my beer, woman?".
So that`s how it goes: girly tears are for girls and sissies! Chuck Norris forbid a guy would weep watching something that has this tag! Now 20 push-ups!
P.S. The opposite of "manly tears". Or is it? Let`s face it - it`s all subjective (and relative, and context-dependent).</description>

<name>season</name>
<description>A season is a division of the year, marked by changes in weather, ecology, and hours of daylight. Seasons result from the yearly orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth`s rotational axis relative to the plane of the orbit. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth`s surface, variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.
During May, June, and July, the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun. The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December, January, and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere.
In temperate and subpolar regions, four calendar-based seasons (with their adjectives) are generally recognized: spring (vernal), summer (estival), autumn (autumnal), fall and winter (hibernal). Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring (prevernal) and late summer (serotinal) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four.

<summary>While testing his high-speed film video camera, second year high school student Kirishima Kaito sees a bright blue light, then an impact has blown him off of his footing and beyond the railings. He sees a hand grabbing his as he fell, bloodied, only to wake up in his futon the next day. At his school, a transfer student named Takatsuki Ichika comes to a third year class. Somehow the both of them has a familiarity with each other when his classmate Tetsurou approaches her and her classmate Yamano Remon, proposing that she joins a movie project he and Kaito are planning. She accepts it without hesitation, and Remon volunteers to write the script. Kaito`s classmates Tanigawa Kanna and Kitahara Mio volunteered later. When Kaito goes to test his camera after class, he finds Ichika fishing in the river. He finds out that she has nowhere to go, so he unwittingly offered her to stay at his house, given that his sister will be away for three months. Back home, as Ichika takes a bath, Kaito felt pain in his neck, then sees a flashback of what happened the evening before. Ichika finds him unconscious, with a sign of increased metabolism on the area where that insect bite was. Ichika then calls for her assistant Rinon to stop it, as she kissed him. Exactly as Kanna and Kaito`s sister Nanami arrive.

<summary>Ichika becomes the heroine of the independent film the gang were planning before summer break. Kaito agrees, while helping Ichika look for that particular place she is looking for. Kanna becomes uneasy when the lines for the film becomes somewhat uncannily realistic, especially in the scenes involving Kaito and Ichika. Even Kaito was surprised by Ichika`s questions that evening. As the next day was a rainy one and filming is cancelled, Kanna goes to Kaito`s house to bring some nozawana. That evening, Tetsurou, after meeting an uneasy home-bound Kanna, sneaks into Kaito`s room, and tells him that she, his childhood friend, is in love with him. Ichika overhears the conversation.

<summary>Things turn awkward the next day, but they try to put it behind them. More complications arrive when Manami, Tetsurou`s married sister, takes a homebound Kaito for shopping. Ichika sees them, and followed them via teleportation with Rinon`s help, even at her place. Worried about what will happen next, Ichika enters and tries to take him home...though not without clashing a bit with Manami, acting like an overprotective lover, until Tetsurou comes to clear things up, that Manami is already married, and she`s here because of a petty quarrel with her husband. As an apology Ichika asked Kaito for a favor from him. He asked if she could help him review for the finals, to which she agreed, and helped him study until the final day of exams.

<summary>Kaito seems to be frustrated with his failed attempt to confess to Ichika, so he decides to ditch school, telling her to leave him alone for awhile. Worried, Kanna goes to visit him at his house. It turned out into a date as the two went to Karuizawa. Ichika sees them from a distance and follows them. Kanna had to leave Kaito when she finds out Remon has been filming their "date." It so happened that Ichika crosses paths with Kaito. Nervous of the prospect that she wants to talk to him, he runs away from her, and a chase ensues. It was all about a misunderstanding—that Kaito wants to know Ichika`s secret, while Ichika wants to know who dumped Kaito. When Kaito took some footage of Ichika, it turned out into some sort of an informal confession. Shocked, Kaito stops filming her.

<summary>In this episode Ichika is revealed to be an alien journeying to look for a certain scenery that she has been seeing in her imagination. She crash lands on Earth when her spacecraft hits space debris. Meanwhile, Nanami awakens, saying she has had a dream about Kaito being hugged by a naked girl in a ball of light. Nanami gets to know Ichika, and out of nervousness the latter almost reveals that she is an alien, but manages to convince them that she is a foreign student. Listening to her story, Nanami lets her move in with them, since she will be away for quite some time, and she was looking for someone to take care of Kaito. Kanna was surprised to hear it, even thinking it to be some sort of a wedding arrangement in exasperation. After seeing Nanami off the next day, and right after shopping for clothes for Ichika, Kaito finds Remon, Tetsurou, Mio and Kanna inside the house—to talk about the movie project. That, and Lemon serving them some sort of spiked drink, which had "bad" effects on Kanna. Kaito again fainted due to the same illness, but Ichika kissed it away.

<summary>After Ichika enjoys her first Japanese festival, Remon pops out of nowhere to challenge everyone to a test of courage at a dark shrine. During the test Rinon appears to Ichika, telling that an emergency beacon has been activated. True enough, a League lifeboat (a rescue drone) comes to rescue her (it`s more of taking her by force), but Ichika says she has still a lot to do. Then again, when Kaito hears Ichika scream, he rushed to where she is, abandoning his partner Kanna. Even with the help of Rinna, one of Ichika`s machines, Kaito dies rescuing "the one he loves." Ichika, however, manages to reverse Kaito`s death. Kaito awakens and sees himself with Ichika inside a ball of light, and mysteriously returning to the same spot. Everyone catches up to the two and sees Ichika incessantly apologizing in front of Kaito.

<summary>As Ichika is pondering on what Tetsurou told Kaito that night, thanks to Tetsurou`s sister, filming for their movie goes to Okinawa, where Kaito meets a childhood friend, and Tetsurou is found pleasing by her companion. This puts Kanna and Ichika at an unease, especially when Kaori, the girl, says that Kaito is her fiance. Mio, on the other hand, is uneasy herself when Chiharu, Kaori`s companion, sets her sights on Tetsurou.

<summary>After the incident involving the rescue drone Ichika reveals her true identity to Kaito and the gang, and reveals her true intentions on Earth, namely "looking for that place in her memory." Kaito, however, isn`t surprised because he already knows the fact. However, with the rather rough "rescue attempt" by The League rescue drone, she believes that another will come to investigate, and fears that her days on Earth are numbered; thus shunning Kaito for awhile—and sealing her feelings for him. This irritated Kanna, telling Ichika that "looking for that place" is just an excuse to avoid him. Kanna confessed that she has feelings for Kaito, and runs away after confronting Ichika—only to be consoled later by Tetsurou, hurting Mio in the process. Kaito, with a bit of encouragement from Remon, did confess to Ichika later—and, when Kaito said it`s his first kiss, she revealed that she has kissed Kaito four times already, as she gave him the fifth one.

<summary>Ichika and Kaito spend some time close together (which Ichika credits to Kanna). Speaking of Kanna, she, depressed, shuts herself in her room after a visit from Tetsurou, who tells everyone that she has a cold. He meets Mio on the way, where they shared the cake she was to give Kanna. There Mio asks and hears his reason why he invited Ichika to do the film with them. Angry at himself, Tetsurou kicks the wooden railing and injures himself. The next day Tetsurou invites Kanna to their old playground as kindergarten kids, and confesses to her, but she rejects him; and as she runs off to Kaito`s place to confess (only to be rejected by Kaito anyway), Tetsuro falls on his knees, where Mio sneaks from behind and hugs him, saying it`s alright to cry. The filming of the movie continues, but one day Ichika`s older sister appears.
