<description>Oddish are a weed-like Pokémon found in all regions throughout the Pokémon world. (with the exception of Pokémon Blue and Pokémon Leaf Green) Oddish looks like a small animated onion/turnip plant with a rounded body. Its body is blue or purple with two small feet and red eyes. On top of its head grows a large clump of 5 long green blades of grass. Its name likely came from the words "odd" and "radish".
Oddish is a nocturnal Pokémon, using moonlight rather than the sun`s rays for photosynthesis. During the day, Oddish avoids the sun`s heat and brightness by burying itself into the earth, leaving only the leaves on top of its head visible above ground. In this way it disguises itself as a plant, misdirecting its carnivorous diurnal predators.
While buried, Oddish nourishes itself by absorbing nutrients from the soil using its feet, which are said to temporarily change into a root-like structure for this purpose.
Oddish has been known to use its leaves as hands, such as one who used this to climb a rope net and tried to fly like a Hoppip.
If anyone pulls at Oddish`s leaves and tries to uproot it while it is buried underground, Oddish will react by shrieking in a cute, high-pitched voice. This mirrors the behavior of the legendary mandrake in a similar situation, although it seems that Oddish`s squeaks do not have the same dire consequences as a mandrake`s.</description>

<description>Sentret is a very cautious Pokémon, it raises itself up onto its tail to get a better view of its surroundings. While standing on its tail, it can see a long way. If it spots an enemy, it will cry out loudly to warn its kind. It will also hit the ground with its tail. A Sentret will only sleep when another one is standing guard. The Sentret will wake the others at the first sign of danger. Because of this, if one is separated from its pack, then it will be unable to sleep due to fear.
Sentret is based on a squirrel.</description>

<description>Furret live in colonies with tunnels much too small for normal Pokemon to traverse, yet it is a perfect fit for the slim build of Furret as it hides from the outside world at the surface by traversing through these tunnels like gophers. These tunnel colonies become very complex, especially if they are very deep, and can potentially stretch for miles. Occasionally, these colonies are found intertwined with Diglett colonies. The Furret evolves from Sentret at level 15.
Furret`s rudimentary paws and legs are deceptively nimble, making Furret a quick, unpredictable predator especially skillful at hunting Rattata, its main prey. Also, the fur of the Pokemon is thicker than it appears, and Furret can fluff up its fur to make itself look much stronger and larger than it actually is as an intimidation tactic towards potential foes.
Furret is based on a ferret or squirrel.</description>

<description>Hoothoot is one of two owl Pokémon. Hoothoot seems to have one foot. However, it actually has two feet; at least one is retracted against its body at almost all times, and Hoothoot can switch between one foot and the other at speeds almost too fast for the human eye. Hoothoot are also known for having precise senses of time, due to a special mechanism in their brain that measures the rotation of the earth. Properly trained, they can be more accurate than all but the most precise of clocks. In nature, they always begin hooting at the same time every night.</description>

<description>Marill is an aquatic mouse Pokémon. Marill`s tail floats like a buoy because it is filled with oil, which is less dense than water. When fishing at a fast-running stream, Marill wraps its tail around a tree. Since the tail is stretchy and flexible, it allows the Pokémon to get food and still stay safely anchored. Otherwise, when in a lake, it uses the buoy-qualities of its tail to keep itself suspended as the rest of its body dives underwater to feed on aquatic plants. Its fur is impermeable, which keeps it dry, and that allows it to swim through water at high speed without being slowed by the water`s resistance.
In the Pokémon Anime, Tracey, the Pokémon Observer from the Orange Islands, has a Marill which he uses on multiple occasions.</description>

<description>Azumarill is the evolved form of Marill. Azumarill resembles a blue, bipedal rabbit with a large, ellipsoid body, long blue ears with red insides, and a blue ball on the end of its thin, elastic black tail. The white bubble-like pattern on its lower stomach helps it to camouflage itself from potential predators when it is in the water.
Azumarill`s long ears act as sensors to identify sounds even in fast running rivers. Otherwise, when alone, Azumarill plays in water as a natural pastime, though it must roll up its elongated ears to prevent the sensitive sensory materials inside them from getting wet. The ball at the end of its tail can act as a sensor and guide it while under water. It can make thick, liquid balloons out of thin air with the saliva-water stored in its body. If it spots a drowning Pokémon in any body of water, it fashions such air balloons and jumps in to give the troubled Pokémon air balloons to help it breathe.
In the Pokémon anime, Paul owned an Azumarill which he used in a gym battle against Roark. Although it knew powerful Water attacks like Hydro Pump, it lost to Roark`s Geodude, which prompted Paul to give it to a Pokémon trainer passing by, being disappointed by its strength.</description>

<description>Teddiursa is a bear cub, resembling a teddy bear more than a real bear. Teddiursa have a crescent mark on their forehead, which grows (both in thickness and in circumference) as the Pokémon ages. Once the crescent fully closes into a circle, the Teddiursa is ready to evolve into an Ursaring. Teddiursa, although an omnivore, has a diet that almost exclusively consists of honey. It makes its own honey out of fruit and pollen from Beedrill. It lets the honey soak in its paws, making it often lick its paws.</description>

<description>Ursaring is a large (although arboreal) bear with a yellow ring on its stomach. Ursaring eats food obtained from digging deep underground as well as berries from trees. Ursaring can hibernate through an entire winter without any food. Ursaring`s sense of smell is among the most developed of all Pokémon; it can detect subtle differences in scents. For this reason, Ursaring is sometimes used by police in the Pokémon universe, both as a strong enforcer, and as an explosive-sniffing Pokémon. If criminals are hiding in trees, it can use its claws to cut down the tree.
Its Japanese name, "Ringuma", originates from "ring" (ringu) and "bear" (kuma). In the anime, Ursaring is caught by Paul, after it is angered by Turtwig.</description>

<description>Shroomish is a mushroom-like Pokémon species found in the Hoenn region. It has small feet protruding from the bottom of its body. Shroomish subsist on a diet of damp, composted soil, and can be seen feeding on it in swarms following rain storms. They produce a toxic spore from glands on its cap.</description>

<description>Breloom is the larger and more developed evolved form that a Shroomish can metamorph into. This diurnal herbivore that lives in fields and forests with leaves for Breloom to feed on. Its favorite climate conditions are sunlight-induced warmth and humidity, which is when Breloom is at its most active. Breloom`s body is configured for battling opponents in a competitive boxing fashion. Its stretchable arms are capable of extremely quick, rapid-fire punches that are virtually invisible, putting professional human boxers to shame (compare with Hitmonchan).
Spores are located within Breloom`s toadstool cap, and Breloom sprays and scatters these spores out of the red holes on its cap as its tool to debilitate and poison opponents. Also toxically sporous are the seeds on Breloom`s tail, which sometimes drop off and are grown back. These seeds let loose their sporous contents when Breloom thwacks an opponent with its tail, making the foe even more at risk of succumbing to poisoning. These seeds are horrid things to consume; a mere bite out of one of these seeds that may be lying around on the forest floor will cause the consumer`s stomach to rumble.
Breloom is notable as one of two final-form Pokemon to receive the attack Spore, a sleep-inducing move with an accuracy of 100.</description>

<description>Starly is a Starling Pokémon that lives in noisy flocks with numerous members in each. It becomes less prominent when one is alone. The female`s forehead coloring is smaller than that of the male. It, and its evolutions, resemble the three bird pokemon of Pokemon Blue, Red and Green, Pidgy, Pidgeotto, and Pidgeot.
Both Ash and Paul catch Starly. Unlike Paul, Ash keeps his after catching it. Paul catches three of them, but releases two of them, and releases the last one at the end of the same episode. Ash`s Starly evolves into Staravia during a battle with Team Rocket.</description>

<description>The Beginning
Ash is the main character of the Pokémon anime. Raised in Pallet Town, he started his journey to become a Pokémon Master at the age of 10. On the day that he started his journey, Ash carelessly woke up late despite being told by his mother, Delia Ketchum to get to bed. He rushed to Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory only to find out that the beginner Pokémon - Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander - had already been given out to trainers who arrived on time. However, Professor Samual Oak mentioned that there was one more Pokémon available - Pikachu. Despite constantly hitting Ash with Electric-type attacks and refusing to return to its PokéBall, Ash decided to take Pikachu along with him on his journey to become a Pokémon Master. Pikachu is cold towards Ash at first and laughs at his failures; however, when Ash saves Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow, he begins to warm up to his new trainer and the two finally become friends. After the battle with the flock of Spearow, a Ho-Oh is seen flying towards a rainbow in the sky. The PokéDex reveals that the Ho-Oh is an unidentified Pokémon. Thus, the journey of Ash and Pikachu begins.
Captures in Viridian Forest
While making his way towards Pewter City and his first Kanto League Gym Battle, Ash came upon a wild Caterpie deep within Viridian Forest. Instead of using Pikachu to battle against the wild Pokémon, Ash took his chances and threw a PokéBall without weakining the Caterpie first. Luckily, he was able to catch the Pokémon without any trouble. The capture of Ash`s Caterpie marked Ash`s first capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Caterpie the second Pokémon to join his team.
The next day, while continuing the trek through the Viridian Forest, Ash came up on a wild Pidgeotto. He tried to just throw a PokéBall like he did with Ash`s Caterpie, but Pidgeotto swatted the PokéBall away. Misty informed that he must weaken the Pokémon first before attempting to capture it. He called out Ash`s Caterpie to battle against, but Misty quickly informed him that Bug-type Pokémon are weak against Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeotto. After Pidgeotto dealt significant damage to Ash`s Caterpie, Ash recalled it and sent out Pikachu. Pikachu was able to use its Thundershock to weaken Pidgeotto and allow Ash to capture it with a PokéBall. Thus, this capture marked Ash`s second capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Pidgeotto the third Pokémon to join his team.
Later on, while still in the Viridian Forest, Ash was approached by Team Rocket, who attempted to steal his Pokémon. After defeating Meowth, James`s Koffing, and Jessie`s Ekans, Ash`s Caterpie evolved into Ash`s Metapod.
Some of Ash`s greatest accomplishments have been at the various Pokémon Leagues. He was the victor at the Orange League and the Battle Frontier. He also competed in the Indigo League and the Johto Silver Conference where he placed admirably in both those competitions as well.
Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup
Ash participated in the Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup at the Kagome Town stadium. In the first round he was in the fifth match and faced off against Marris. The match was quickly showcased and Ash won the battle and advanced to the second round while Marris was eliminated from the tournament.
The Isshu League
Ash participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where he was matched up against Trip. Trip`s Serperior was sent out to battle Pikachu and Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior`s speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter Trip`s Serperior speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round. The two met in the Pokémon Center after the battle, and Trip vowed that the next time they met that he would win. The two shook hands and parted ways.
In the first main round, Ash`s opponent was shown on the match up electronic board but not much else is known about the battle. Ash`s Scraggy participated in the second main round of the Isshu League tournament where it faced off against a Darumakka. It was able to defeat it so that moved on to the next round.
In the third round, Stephan was matched up against Ash. Cilan noted that the two of them have a very direct taste and that it would be a good battle. It was only a 3 on 3 battle but the both of them gave it their all. The first two battles of the third round setup the final match up of Stephan`s Sawk vs Ash`s Krookodile, both of which were very injured from the previous battles. Both of them did their best to muster up their reserve strength but in the end a surprise move of Aerial Ace by Ash`s Krookodile was super effective against Stephan`s Sawk and it knocked it out to give Ash the victory while eliminating Stephan from the tournament. Stephan realized after the battle that the reason that Ash withdrew Waruvial after the first battle was because Ash knew that Stephan would definitely send out Dageki, so he didn`t reveal that it knew Aerial Ace and saved until the end.</description>

<description>The Beginning
On the morning that Ash was to start his Pokémon journey, he woke up late and by the time he reached Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory, all of the beginner Pokémon were already taken. However, Professor Samual Oak did have one Pokémon left, a wild Pikachu. At first, Pikachu did not like Ash and would refuse to enter his PokéBall. He would often laugh at Ash`s failures and refused to listen to him. However, after Ash proved his loyalty to Pikachu by protecting him from a flock of Spearow, and thus began to earn Pikachu`s trust and respect. The two have since become best friends and Pikachu never leaves Ash`s side.
Since the day Team Rocket first encountered Pikachu, it has been their sole goal to capture it. Day after day, their plan to capture Pikachu has been thwarted mainly due to Pikachu`s amazingly powerful Thunderbolt that keeps on blasting them off.
On numerous occasions, Pikachu has made it evident that he is happy being a Pikachu and has no desire to evolve into a more powerful Raichu. It has proven time and time again that it is a powerful and worthy opponent to any Pokémon that dares to battle it.
Gym Battle against Burgh`s Leavanny
Pikachu was then sent out to battle Burgh`s Leavanny. Burgh`s Leavanny managed to tie up Pikachu with String Shot but unlike Ash`s Swadloon who was able to break free, Pikachu ended up getting hit with a couple of Leaf Storm attacks and a Hyper Beam before it rolled into another of Burgh`s Leavanny`s Leaf Storm attacks to break the string off its body so it could attack. Freed from the String Shot, Burgh`s Leavanny tried to tie it up again but Pikachu managed to avoid it with its speed and then knocked Burgh`s Leavanny out with a combination of Iron Tail and Electro Ball.
Gym Battle against Elesa
Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy and was then matched up with Pikachu. Pikachu made quick work of Elesa`s Emolga and knocked it out with one attack, its Iron Tail.
Elesa`s Tynamo was the last Pokémon that she used in her gym battle against Ash. It was matched up against Pikachu who had just defeated her Emonga. Pikachu had a hard time defending against the fast Tackle attack that Elesa`s Tynamo kept hitting it with but Pikachu used its Thunderbolt to create a large dust cloud leaving only a small corridor for Pikachu to focus on it and so Elesa`s Tynamo couldn`t maneuver out of the way. Pikachu one hit K.O`d Elesa`s Tynamo with a Iron Tail. The loss gave Ash the overall victory.
Battle against Alder`s Bouffalant
Ash challenged Alder to a battle and he accepted though he had been walking all night and was actually quite tired. Alder sent out his Buffron to battle Pikachu but just as the battle started, Alder fell asleep standing up and didn`t give any orders to his Buffron. Alder`s Bouffalant stood still as Pikachu began hitting it with attack after attack until it Alder`s Bouffalant finally got mad at Alder and charged at him and set him flying into a tree. After that, Alder`s Bouffalant no longer wished to battle and Alder conceded the battle.
Gym Battle against Skyla
In Skyla air battle simulation, Ash`s Tranquill was matched up against Skyla`s Unfezant and since her Pokémon was the highest evolved form, she determined that her Pokémon would be the winner in that match-up. In the actual gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was up against Skyla`s Unfezant which was the match-up just after Ash`s Tranquill had defeated Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla`s Unfezant proved to be stronger and faster than Ash`s Tranquill, so Ash recalled it and set out Pikachu. Pikachu had a definite advantage over Skyla`s Unfezant with its electric attacks and it quickly knocked it out with its Electro Ball attack.
Ash Just after Pikachu ended up knocking out Skyla`s Unfezant, Skyla`s Swanna was sent out to battle against it. Skyla had been watching her grandpa`s battle videos and noticed that he used the move Aqua Ring to defend against Electric attacks. She used that same defense against Pikachu which nullified its Electric attacks. It`s Iron Tail also couldn`t hit it so high in the air. Ash then noticed the rings in the air and Pikachu jumped up on them and managed to hit Skyla`s Swanna but not directly. Pikachu was now up in the air though and Skyla`s Swanna had the advantage there and it quickly knocked Pikachu out with a powerful Brave Bird attack.
Battle Against Trip`s Serperior at the Isshu League
Pikachu participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where it is was matched up against Trip`s Serperior. Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter its speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round.</description>

<description>He is a Pokémon researcher that was once a competitive Trainer, and is generally considered the best in his field. As such, his role in the Pokémon games and anime is that of a mentor to young Pokémon Trainers, a source of information and an occasional plot device. Amongst other things, he is credited with inventing the Pokédex. He also hands out a Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander to beginning trainers (depending on which Pokémon the trainer chooses) to start their adventure in the Kanto Region. Although he is an expert on all matters relating to Pokémon, Professor Oak specializes in Pokémon behavioural science. He appears in Pokémon 4Ever as a child who was pulled into the future by Celebi. Additionally, it is apparent after Pokémon 3: The Movie that he knew Delia Ketchum since she was a child; this most likely is the reason he occasionally exhibits parental-type concern (mainly in the form of scolding Ash as he is doing something that is dangerous). He also creates poems centred around Pokémon and is known as the rhyming professor by Dawn.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>While traveling in the Isshu region just outside of Kanako Town, Ash mistakenly thought Iris was a Pokémon and threw a monster ball at her. Ash thought she was a Axew as the Zukan displayed the data for it. Her Axew appeared out of her large hair moments later though. After learning that Cilan was going to be traveling with Ash through the Isshu region, Iris decided that she would travel with them as well but she said that her goal on this journey was a secret.
In the games, Iris is one of the gym leaders of Souryuu City`s Gym but it is currently unknown if she holds the same title in the anime.
Displeasure of Ice Pokémon
Just before Ash and Trip`s three-on-three battle, Iris encountered Trip`s Vanillite. She instantly tried to avoid it and started to shiver. She explained that since Dragon types have a disadvantage against Ice types, she dislike the cold that Ice Pokémon create. Trip tried to confront her about her dislike of Ice Pokémon by telling her that Dragon Pokémon are also strong against Dragon Pokémon but she only reluctantly apologized to Trip`s Vanillite and her mind wasn`t truly changed.
Making up with Excadrill
Excadrill didn`t always want to obey Iris when its asked to do something. For awhile, it was stubborn but Iris`s Excadrill was able to overcome the feelings of resentment and lost of trust it felt from the battle against Drayden`s Haxorus. After relating her experience to Ash and Cilan, it became more clear to Iris that she was not fully understanding her Excadrill`s feelings. Iris apologized to her Excadrill as she finally realized that her Excadrill knew after the first hit during the battle against Drayden`s Haxorus that they couldn`t win against it. The two of them then practiced all through the night until Excadrill was finally able to successfully launch the Focus Blast.
Rival Langley
While on route to Raimon City, Iris encountered Georgia, a Dragon Buster who once had a battle in the Dragon Village and her Pokémon was beaten up and now has it out for anyone from the village. Georgia managed to coax Iris into a battle but Iris`s Axew was no match for Georgia`s Beartic and Georgia ended up intimidating and angering Iris by saying the victory was easy and boring. Iris though was determined to defeat her new rival and during the rematch battle she managed to end it in a draw.
Don Battles
Iris entered the Don Battles, a battle tournament to be held in Raimon Town, with her friends and rivals. Jimmy Ray was easily defeated in the first round by Iris.
Stephan`s Sawk battled against Iris`s Emolga in the second round of the Don George Battle Tournament in Raimon Town but Emonga`s Static ability proved to be the deciding factor in the match. The Static ability ended up paralyzing Stephan`s Sawk and it was then a sitting target for Iris`s Emolga`s Volt Switch which knocked it out. Iris`s Emolga`s win eliminated Stephan from the tournament.
Iris`s Axew and Luke`s Golett were matched up in the semi-final round of the Don Battles in Raimon Town. Luke`s Golett dominated most of the battle and just as Iris`s Axew was about to be defeated, it learned the move Outrage. Outrage was able to do significant damage to Luke`s Golett and it knocked it out which eliminated Luke from the tournament.
In the finals, Iris battled against Ash and though it was a close battle, Iris`s Excadrill had the type advantage against Pikachu and she won the tournament. For winning, Iris received the beautiful seven-feather "Top-Class Driftveil Wing Set," containing Health, Muscle, Resist, Genius, Clever, Swift, and Pretty Wings which she sent to Dragon Village via Pidove Shipping Service.
Day Care Monozu
In BW58, befriended a shy and lonely Monozu that was awaiting its Trainer to return. As Monozu`s are a Dragon Type Pokémon, Iris was instantly excited to spend time with it. It took her awhile to gain its trust though. Iris recalled an event to Monozu that she witnessed in the Dragon Village where she saw Elder befriend a Crimgan that got lost and somehow found its way into the Village. The Crimgan absolutely refused to get along with other Dragon types and the people of the Village. For days and days, the Crimgan wouldn`t come out from deep within the cave. The Elder waited for Crimgan at the entrance of the cave the whole time and she tried to make the Crimgan open its heart to her, by talking to it like the way Iris was talking to Monozu to gain its trust and friendship. After several days had passed, Crimgan came out of the cave. All the Elder had done was talk to it and still, she managed to free it from its insecurities.
Iris uses the same technique that Elder used and the shy Monozu became more open with Iris and the two of them became friends. Iris spent a few days with the Monozu as they awaited the Trainer to return. At one point, Iris suggested to the Monozu if its Trainer didn`t return that it could come with her. The Trainer did return though and Monozu left with it but not before it gave Iris its biggest smile.
Fukiyose Tower Bell of Wishes Festival
Stephan met up with Iris and her friends and informed them of the Fukiyose Tower Bell of Wishes Festival that he was going to participate in. After hearing from him that it was an awesome event held once a year at the Fukiyose Tower, Iris and her friends decided to enter the tournament with Stephan.
Iris and Iris`s Axew paired up for the tournament. In the scavenger hunt, Iris asked Cilan to lent her his fishing rod so she could advance to the next round. In the tub race, Iris`s Axew used Dragon Rage on the surface of the water to propel them to the next round. During the imitation competition, iris was forced to dress-up as Professor Juniper and Miles thought she did quite well and he advanced her to the next round. In the forest of trials, Iris thought she had won but Chandela`s Confuse Ray affected her and she was in the middle of the forest for the entire race and was therefore eliminated from the tournament.
Rematch Battle against Drayden at the Soryu Gym
Having accepted the challenge to battle at the Dragon Village, Iris met up with Drayden to have a rematch battle. He heard about Iris getting into trouble again by climbing the Soryu Tower but told here to eat something and have a rest while he had a school meeting and then they would have their battle.
During the battle, Drayden was evaluating how much Iris had grown and he noticed that Iris`s Excadrill power certainly seemed to have improved. The matchup between Iris`s Excadrill and Drayden`s Haxorus ended up in a draw as the two of them knocked each other out. In the matchup between, Drayden`s Druddigon and Iris` Dragonite, Drayden noted that Iris` Dragonite had had an interesting life during its past. Iris` Dragonite wanted to fight under the same conditions as Drayden`s Druddigon, who cannot fly. Everyone thought that Iris was doing well in the battle but Drayden`s Druddigon proved to be more powerful than they had anticipated. Drayden`s Druddigon knocked out Iris` Dragonite with a powerful Dragon Tail attack to give Drayden the victory in the rematch battle. Cilan thought Iris had cornered him, but Drayden was still a few steps ahead. Drayden was trying to get a clear picture of Iris by drawing out their power.
Drayden complemented Iris on making good friends and he realized that sending her off on a journey was the right thing to do. He could tell that she had grown up but standing still wasn`t good for her. He told her to strengthen herself even further, become stronger and grow and then visit him again.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Cilan is a gym leader of Sanyo City Gym where he shares the responsibility with Chili and Cress. He is also a Pokémon Sommelier who, with his abundance of knowledge and experience, determines the compatibility of Trainers and Pokémon and gives them advice on how to befriend each other. Cilan specializes in Grass type Pokémon and his main Pokémon and partner is Yanappu. Cilan revealed during BW19 that he had passed the required exams of the Pokémon Sommelier association to become a certified A-class Sommelier who is able to make compatibility diagnoses.
Cilan has many female fans who flock to his presence though he puts off their advances almost immediately. Brock has been quoted saying that, "Cilan is gay." and Shigeru`s fanclub has extended an invitation to all female Cilan fans to join the Gary Oak`s fanclub instead! The Polish drug scene has seen an increase in the usage of the ACE inhibitor Cilan (Cilazapril) as a result of Cilan flamboyant escapades at night. In the English closed captions for BW12, the transcribers listed Cilan as `Cilas`. A quick google search for `Cilas` and the first result is Cialis, an erectile dysfunction disorder drug.
It`s Dent Time! - Dent`s Catch Phrases
Dent in the Japanese original has various phrases that are based off his original "It`s Tasting Time!" catch phrase. It`s generally modified in the episode to match what`s going on in that particular instance. Below is a list of these catch phrases.
It`s Cilan Time! - Cilan`s Catch Phrases
Cilan in the English Dub has various phrases that are based off Dent`s original "It`s Tasting Time!" catch phrase. Some of them are exclusive to the English dub.
Rival Cabernet
Burgundy is Pokémon Sommelière and a Pokémon Trainer who upon passing the C-class Sommelier test, decided to challenge Cilan at the Sanyo Gym for the Tri Badge. Cilan defeated her but when Burgundy returned to challenge Cilan at the gym, Chili and Cress had to explain that Cilan was on a journey and was no longer at the gym. Angry that Cilan was not the gym leader when she visited, she battled at the gym anyhow and won the Tri Badge.
Cilan encountered her at a Friendly Shop while on his way to Hiun City and she was now out for revenge. Burgundy challenged Cilan to a revenge battle where she ended up losing to him yet again. More angry than ever, she vowed to defeat Cilan the next time they met while working to become an S-class Sommelière and she took off.
Fishing Sommelier
In BW26, Cilan stated that he was a Fishing Sommelier. He was able to help Bianca learn how to fish better by showing her how to select a good fishing rod and then the two basic forms of casting techniques: the overhead cast and the side hand cast. Cilan also showed her the proper lure techniques by spinning the reel slowly and not rushing to attempt to catch the Water Pokémon. He has his own fishing rod that is collapsible and easy to carry. Cilan proved his Fishing Sommelier were quite good by catching a large Bassrao at the Fishing Tournament.Cilan`s Stunfisk was also captured by using his fishing skills.
Science Sommelier
In BW33, Cilan explained that he is not only a Pokémon Sommelier but also a Science Sommelier. A Science Sommelier is someone who tries to solve any kind of supernatural phenomenon by finding out the cause scientifically by collecting evidence and proving their theory. Cilan has always tried to solve mysterious problems scientifically like the poltergeist that he and his friends encountered at the Shippo Museum in BW14 which turned out to be a Deathmas.
Movie Sommelier
In BW40, Cilan announced that he as a Movie Sommelier, someone that is able to review, critique and analyze the different elements of a movie and its characters. Cilan specifically showed his knowledge as a Movie Sommelier when he was helping out with Luke`s movie "Legend of the Pokémon Knight" by making suggestions and improvising on the go. He also helped out Ash who was a bit nervous being in front of the camera and he talked about the famous movie, "The Mask of Deathmas", where the heroine is portrayed as putting her life on the line for the sake of acting. He told Ash that in order to move the viewers with his performance, he`d need to become the role he was assigned.
Metro Sommelier
While heading down to the underground railway in Raimon City, Cilan professed that he was also a Metro Sommelier. Metro Sommeliers are divided into a "car group", which is particular about the cars or into a "line group", which is particular about the lines. Cilan said he belonged to the car group. being a metro sommelier is basically joining a fan club for people that metro transit. Cilan met Subway Boss Ingo and Subway Boss Emmet at the previous years subway convention. Cilan`s knowledge came in quite handy when he had to drive the rail carriage to catch up to Team Rocket.
In BW53, Cilan used his skills as a Metro Sommelier to help him complete the subway station stamp rally so he could battle against Subway Boss Ingo and Subway Boss Emmet. Cilan had been dreaming of doing the rally for many years so he could battle them as its considered a great honor for Metro Sommelier`s. Cilan was also able to use his knowledge and skills as a Metro Sommelier to reunite Erina with her Kibago.
Trial Sommelier
While in Astilbe Town, Ash`s Tepig original owner Shamus was put on trial by Cilan after he revealed that he was a Trial Sommelier. He presented himself as an impartial courtroom judge in the Karakusa Town Pokabu Abandonment case where Prosecutor Ash told about the cruel abandonment of Ash`s Tepig where it had a rope tied up around its mouth. The defendant Shamus told a different story though as he said that forcing a talentless Pokémon into futile battles is crueler. Unable to make a decision in the case, Don George suggested that the verdict be decided with a battle and Cilan agreed. After Ash`s Pignite defeated Shamus, Cilan said the battle had a superb taste and that there`s no need to hand down a verdict as it`s obvious that Ash and Ash`s Tepig were right.
Gym Battle against Skyla
After watching Skyla perform `air battles` which were her determining how a battle would go against her gym challengers by simulating the battle in her head, Cilan got very upset that she was not actually doing the battles and he challenged her to a battle. Cilan agreed to do an `air battle` with her and she determined that he would loose the battle against her with the Pokémon he had chosen to battle her with. Cilan though wanted to have a real battle with her a he explained to her that with Pokémon battle, like any meal, must be tasted first before people can be certain to know anything. Skyla agreed and Cilan thought that he would be able to show her up by defeating her in a real battle and showing how her `air battles` are flawed. Unfortunately Cilan ended up loosing to Skyla but Ash challenged her to a battle right after.
Fukiyose Tower Bell of Wishes Festival
Stephan met up with Cilan and his friends and informed them of the Fukiyose Tower Bell of Wishes Festival that he was going to participate in. After hearing from him that it was an awesome event held once a year at the Fukiyose Tower, Cilan and his friends decided to enter the tournament with Stephan.
During the quiz, Cilan didn`t know how they`d be able to answer the question about who Miles liked better as it was a very subjectional question. Miles was going to pick Nurse Joy (Isshu) as the girl he preferred the most but Cilan seemed to notice Ricky`s Elgyem use its abilities to affect Miles but didn`t say anything as they were able to successfully get the question right and move on to the next round.
In the scavenger hunt, Cilan successfully managed to find a Miracle Shooter while he lent his fishing rod to Iris. In the tub race, Cilan`s Pansage on instruction from Cilan, paddled in the water the same way it used Dig to advance them to the next round. During the imitation competition, Cilan was forced to dress as Elesa and Cilan`s Pansage was forced to dress-up as Elesa`s Emolga. Everyone thought Cilan did an amazing job but Miles informed Cilan that he was a very big Elesa fan and he had to be very strict with imitations of her. Cilan was then eliminated from the tournament.
Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup
Cilan participated in the Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup at the Kagome Town stadium. In the first round he was in the third match and faced off against Shepherd. The match was quickly showcased and Cilan won the battle and advanced to the second round while Shepherd was eliminated from the tournament.</description>

<description>Iris`s Axew was first seen appearing out of Iris`s large hairdo, much to the surprise of Ash and Pikachu. Ash helped rescue Axew from Team Rocket when they captured it just after Iris met Ash.
Axew is Iris`s main Pokémon and it doesn`t seem to like to travel in its monster ball. It seems to prefer traveling on Iris`s shoulders and in her hair.
Mastering Dragon Rage
Iris had been practicing Dragon Rage with her Kibago for quite a while and every time the attack was used it was unsuccessful and created a crater in the ground where the attack was used and injured everyone in the area. After being captured by Team Rocket along with Crimgan, Iris`s Axew managed to master Dragon Rage which was powerful enough to crash their flying transport mecha. In the battle encounter with Team Rocket that occurred after the crash, Iris`s Axew showed everyone that it had finally mastered the move by launching a successful attack at Team Rocket but they managed to escape before it hit them.
Don Battles Against Luke`s Golett
Iris`s Axew and Luke`s Golett were matched up in the semi-final round of the Don Battles in Raimon Town. Luke`s Golett dominated most of the battle and just as Iris`s Axew was about to be defeated, it learned the move Outrage. Outrage was able to do significant damage to Luke`s Golett and it knocked it out which eliminated Luke from the tournament.
Battle against Cynthia`s Garchomp / Learning Giga Impact
Iris asked to battle Cynthia`s Garchomp with her Kibago as she was working on becoming a Dragon Master. Even before it the started, the battled seemed like Cynthia`s Garchomp would win. Iris`s Axew could not do any damage to Cynthia`s Garchomp until it finally concentrated for a few moments and learned Giga Impact. While Giga Impact was able to do some damage to Cynthia`s Garchomp, it quickly overpowered Iris`s Axew until Cynthia decided to end the match before a finishing blow.</description>

<description>This is Virgil`s eighth Eievui. It loves to be pampered but it`s still an apprentice. Virgil had been trying to get it to decide what kind of rescue missions it wanted to do and which type it want to evolve into so it could graduate from its apprenticeship. Virgil`s Eevee couldn`t decide and Virgil wanted to make sure not to rush it and make sure it thought through it carefully so it would pick the evolution that suits it most.
During a battle against some Freegeo at the dam and reservoir, Virgil`s Eevee helped contribute by protecting Virgil`s Flareon and boosting its attacks. While Virgil was busy dealing with the Freegeo`s attacks, Virgil`s Eevee dug a hole down to the basement of the control building which allowed Davey to get out of the building. Virgil realized after those experiences that his Eevee was fine the way it was and that his Eevee Team was now complete.</description>
