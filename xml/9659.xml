<name>trap</name>
<description>A trap is a plot device where a male character is mistaken for a female, with the intention of sexually deceiving other characters and/or the viewer. This behavior does not need to be intentional by the male (it is often not intentional) or continually maintained by the male, but the occurrence is common enough to deserve this fetish-specific tag.
This is often achieved by portraying the male character as a female; primarily via their clothing and physical appearance, but also through his behaviour, and/or language. A male character misinterpreted by others as female, without action from the male (explicitly feminine dress or behaviour), is generally not considered a trap; instead they are likely just http://anidb.net/t2561 [androgynous].
The reverse case is known as a http://anidb.net/t1637 [reverse trap].

<name>swimsuit</name>
<description>A swimsuit is one of several kinds of garments designed to be worn by people engaging in water-based activities or sports or during certain activities under sunlight. Most kinds of swimsuit reveal a large portion of the body surface area, but exceptions exist. The more revealing kinds may also be worn as undergarment in sports that require wetsuits, or when there is a need to display the body, as in the case of beauty pageants or bodybuilding contests.
There is a very wide range of styles of modern swimsuits, which vary in relation to body coverage and materials. The choice of style of swimsuit is dependent on current fashions, community standards of modesty, and plain personal preference. Swimsuits for men usually expose the chest, while those for women do not usually do so; however, many women prefer to engage in water or sun activities with their torso uncovered, in a practice commonly described as toplessness or topfreedom. Since the early twentieth century a naturist movement has developed in western countries that seeks a return to non-sexual nakedness when swimming and during other appropriate activities; in some places around the world, nude beaches have been set aside for people who choose to engage in normal beach activities in the nude, and such beaches may or may not enforce nudity onto their goers.
In anime, it is common for at least one episode to feature the characters in swimsuits, usually as an excuse for gratuitous fanservice; when that happens, the episode is usually labeled a pool or beach episode, after the place the characters went to. Swimsuits, and in particular one-piece swimsuits, are a very common fetish in Japan; while the reason for that is uncertain, a common folk explanation is the fact that boys throughout their entire adolescence are commonly exposed to their female classmates wearing them, in what might be called an experiment in sexual discovery waiting to happen.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>demon</name>
<description>In Western lore, demons are often described as minions from Hell, generally known to attack humans and feast on their flesh or possess the bodies of those with weak souls. In Eastern lore, on the other hand, they are generally supernatural, often but not always malevolent beings who can be more mischievous than actually evil, or simply supernatural spirits of no specific alignment.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<name>absurdist humour</name>
<description>Surreal humour, also known as absurdist humour, is a form of humour predicated on deliberate violations of causal reasoning, producing events and behaviours that are obviously illogical. Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, non-sequiturs, irrational or absurd situations, and expressions of nonsense.
The humour arises from a subversion of audience`s expectations, so that amusement is founded on unpredictability, separate from a logical analysis of the situation. Its appeal stems from the fact that the situation described is exceedingly ridiculous or unlikely.
On an analytical level, all jokes contain a certain amount of incongruity, but while regular jokes carry an incongruity that the audience accepts as compatible with expectations, absurd jokes are characterized by a disproportionate amount of it, with the punch line delivering a situation incompatible with the world as we know it and failing to resolve the matter in the audience`s eyes.

<name>medium awareness</name>
<description>Medium awareness is the situational and generally temporary awareness characters in works of fiction have and display of the very fact that they are characters in works of fiction. For example, they may comment about the background music, quip about the script or narration, complain about the roles given to them by the writer or their lack of screen time, see the subtitles that appear on screen, inform the audience about the arrival of the commercial break, and even use medium effects as tools. The most common form of medium awareness is known as breaking the fourth wall, in which characters speak directly to the audience, either to it as a whole or to specific members of it. The "fourth wall" is the imaginary "wall" at the front of the stage of a proscenium theatre through which the audience sees the play; it is a metaphor for the boundary between what happens inside the work, to the characters, and outside it, to the audience.</description>

<name>large breasts</name>
<description>Large breasts are breasts a fair notch larger than average, as found in some adolescent girls or fully grown women; however, as anime has no upper limit to breast size, the definition applies somewhat differently. To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

<description>The power of love is not only the strongest power known to mankind, it is the strongest power in the universe. The power of love conquers all things. It makes people cry, it makes people laugh, it can make them sing and occasionally it even brings dead people back to life, just so.
More so than the power of friendship, the power of true love gives boundless strength and resolution; by the power of love every hardship can be overcome, every issue can be resolved and it does make people resistant to food poisoning (caused by the bad cooking of their loved ones). Even the big bad evil doesn`t stand a chance against the power of true love and often ends up redeemed.
Even when the power of love is not literally and directly responsible, the scene is often set so that the audience is left with the impression that it was "really responsible".</description>

<description>Hobbies: Reading books in the library (Because it`s free), Supermarket-hopping (Her strong pride keeps her from trying anything that isn`t recommended to her)
Favorite Foods: Cheap and filling food.
Favorite color: Green
Her tastes (fetishes) in men: Honest and diligent people.
Former Hero Candidate. Raul`s rival from their Hero Training Academy days. She was called ``All-A`` due to her excellent marks. After the Hero policy was repealed, her pride kept her from telling Raul that she found a job at the major magic shop chain, Amada Magic, and she feels like that isn`t where she belongs. She`s interested in Raul as more than just a rival, and seeing Fino get along with him makes her angry. She has a complex towards women with big breasts.

Favorite food: Onii-chan`s omelet rice, Colonia taro
Favorite Color: Orange
Her tastes (fetishes) in men: Types like her older brother, Elt
Manager of Leon Royal Capital Shop. She`s a beautiful young girl who looks like she`s in her teens, and she has a gentle, healing aura. However, she`s very strict when it comes to business, and quite the clever one. She is kind, but also strict enough to give her bread crusts and tell her ``You`ll have to make do with this until you can earn better on your own.``
 She could turn any magic item into a pwerful weapon. She`s actually the very person who defeated Fino`s father, the Demon King.

Favorite Color: Red
Her tastes (fetishes) in men: Cool guys! (However, her idea of cool is based on elementary school boys.)
The Demon King`s daughter. Since the Demon King was defeated, she`s become an employee-in-training at Leon in the Royal Capital. She lacks a bit of common sense, but she`s very honest, hard-working, and straightforward. She possesses vast magical power that has yet to awaken, so she can`t use magic without channeling though a magic item. However, she also lacks control and occasionally causes the magic item to go berserk. She inherited her father`s loud laughter and intimidating air of hostility, allowing her to break the spirit of thieves in an instant.

Favorite Color: Black
His tastes (fetishes) in women: He prefers beautiful girls over cute girls. When he looks at women his eyes tend to go towards their breasts or legs.
Former Hero candidate. At the Hero Training Academy, he was the top of his class, and the closest man to becoming the next Hero. Now he`s a full time employee at one of the Royal Capital`s magic shops. He still clings to his desire to be the Hero, but he reluctantly found a job. When he gets put in charge of training Fino, he starts gaining motivation towards his job. He`s maintained the abilities he cultivated when he was aiming to be a Hero, and he can still defeat monsters in a single blow. His retorts to Fino are already reflexive.

<description>Hobbies: Colleting information on magic items, expanding magic shops
Employee at LAWSON Royal Capital Shop. She`s bright, and one of the rare few people who can talk casually to Raul. For example, they can have a casual chat in the classroom, but she`s not a girl he sees a romantic interest. Although it seems Elza has a thing for Raul on the other hand... She`s an extreme magic item aficionado. She`s what you`d call a consumer electronics otaku. She was born in the rural country where no shops existed, but she read through catalogs until the pages wore out.

<description>Hobbies: Shopping
A part-timer at Leon Royal Capital Shop. She has a sexy body with big breasts and a big butt, and she`s a cute girl who`s a bit airheaded. She doesn`t get piercings or anything to improve her strong sex appeal, and she`s surprisingly earnest. She`s very naive and isn`t fazed when her older coworkers touch her. While she tends to panic when things get busy, she`s also so clueless she`ll keep serving customers without realizing a thief is there.

However, he`s been through hard times with exploitative businesses that left him traumatized. He`s always sighing and thinking negatively. He gives off an aura of not wanting to work. He`s best friends with Elt, Sarah`s older brother, and her childhood friend.

Employee at LAWSON Royal Capital Shop. Her tone is often faked politeness as she spouts fair arguments, but she also has an Enshuu accent. She hates her name being shortened to Lam-chan. She seems to have an overbearing personality, but she keeps careful watch around here and shows consideration for others.
She`s actually a demon, and heiress to the demon world`s famous Akusimemoru family. After the demon world broke down, she decided to emigrate to the human world and values coexisting with humans.

<description>Hobbies: Tinkering with Magic Items
Leon Royal Capital Shop`s engineer. She`s in charge of repairs and the air conditioner. Fundamentally, she`s quite, but she becomes very talkative when it concerns machines and technology. However, when that happens she starts using difficult technical terms and verbose phrases. She stays calm no matter what, and expresses little emotion. It`s hard to tell what she`s thinking. Usually she`s out on her personal carriage to conduct repairs, so she`s rarely in the store. Her technical skill is solid, and Raul and the others look up to her as their senior.

<summary>Elsa comes by Leon and asks for help as her convenience store is short-handed for the day, and Sarah gives permission for Fino to work for them temporarily, despite Raul`s misgivings. Fino begins training to work at the convenience store and Ram shows her a trick for how to use the store`s magical appliances without the disaster that usually entails when she tries to use any such devices. Fino mixes all sorts of strange ingredients into the store`s oden, and this unexpectedly comes up to be delicious, but they can`t sell it since it`s not the store`s standard recipe. They later offer this to everyone after their work is done.
Meanwhile, back at Leon, Raul starts to notice Nova in spite of himself, and since there are so few customers in the store that leads to some awkwardness. This is made even more awkward when the dirty old man who always comes by to touch Nova`s behind comes by, and after he has bought his light bulb Nova says that Raul can touch her behind too if he wants, although Visor warns him that sexual harassment will not be tolerated.</summary>

<summary>Raul is exasperated that Fino has suddenly moved into the apartment next to his at Sarah`s recommendation, but he has to agree that it is a good idea. When a customer comes by to have a fan fixed, they see Lore Berefiral, who works doing deliveries and in-home maintenance in her rare visits to the store. Meanwhile, Sarah and Visor are called to corporate headquarters and told that although their store has the highest customer satisfaction rating however they also have the lowest sales, so they are to double their inventory, stock generic products, and conduct a major sale.
Later, Airi visits the store, and Raul`s look on his face when he sees her makes Fino think that she`s a complainer, and Fino lets slip details that give away her demonic heritage as he tries to restrain her. Just then one of the generic products that Corporate HQ has ordered them to stock arrives at the store, an air purifier that seems to be of rather dubious quality. Elsa also comes by to visit as it is the end of her shift at the convenience store, and they decide to try to test it as the store has no other customers besides Airi. The air purifier malfunctions spectacularly, the magic gone awry producing Witch`s Arms that entangle Elsa, Nova, Lore, Fino, and Airi as their attempts to shut it down are frustrated as there are too many arms. Raul finds his old magical sword and uses it to cut Fino free, and together they manage to finally turn off the defective device.</summary>

<summary>Raul continues to teach Fino how to speak to the store`s customers properly, giving her a set of eight basic phrases to memorise. On his way to lunch he meets Airi Oltined who was his friend during his days training to be a hero, and she chides him for seemingly abandoned his goal. Meanwhile, a masked man armed with an axe has come to the store, intending to rob it, but Fino treats him like a customer, not realising his intentions, which distracts him. When Raul returns, together they manage to subdue the robber, and are praised by Sarah for their efforts.
That evening, Raul joins some of his old friends from the hero training program and finds that they still haven`t abandoned their dream of becoming heroes, making Raul reluctant to admit to them that he got a job. When he returns to the shop he finds Fino asleep, and from her notebook sees that she has been practising the phrases he told her to memorise. She wakes up and asks him to test her, and she manages to successfully say them all.</summary>

<summary>Raul Chaser was working towards becoming a Hero to defeat the Demon Lord, but just as his training was coming to an end the Demon Lord was unexpectedly defeated and the programme to train heroes was cancelled. With his original purpose gone he reluctantly has to find a job, and winds up working as a clerk in the Royal Capital store, which sells appliances and consumer goods. One day, Fino Bloodstone comes into the store looking for a job, and he sees from her résumé that she is actually the child of the Demon Lord, though he doesn`t at first realise that she`s even a girl. He has to teach her a lot of things about the human world in addition to her duties at the store, and is exasperated at her naivete and ignorance.</summary>

<summary>The city has been struck by a heat wave, and the air conditioning at Leon has failed, and Raul and Fino arrive at the store to find that Nova has collapsed from heat exhaustion. They try to help her, and Raul is found in a compromising situation as Sarah and Visor arrive.
While Lore attempts to repair the air conditioning the store conducts a summer sale with the staff dressed in swimsuits. This becomes wildly successful, and after their work shifts Elsa, Ram, and even Airi are encouraged to participate.
As the day ends the son-in-law to whom they had sold an air conditioning unit comes by and tells Raul how he is a journalist for an important business newspaper and that he has written an article praising the excellent service that he received from them the other day. Amada`s upper management has also seen the article and calls in the manager of the capital shop near Leon and admonishes him for failing to destroy them.</summary>

<summary>Fino and Raul have managed to sell an air conditioning unit to an old lady who was overwhelmed by the technical jargon and overly large selection at Amada, only to find that her son-in-law has at the same time purchased a different air conditioner from Amada himself, so they are now double booked. Raul decides to concede the sale to Amada as that is what the customer seems to want, but as they are about to leave the son-in-law stops them as now they are having trouble as their appliances have stopped working. The tech from Amada examines the place, and determines that they might have faulty wiring, which will be very expensive to repair. Further examination by Lore however uncovers a massive infestation of magic eaters, slime-like pests that consume household magical energy. They use Fino`s immense magical power inherited from her father to draw out the magic eaters, and manage to eliminate the infestation. Their efforts convince the son-in-law to take Leon`s air conditioner instead of Amada`s, despite the penalties that will be charged.</summary>

<summary>Raul and Fino find that Airi has begun working at Amada. She is resentful at being forced to have to take such work, unable to find the same kind of pride in her work that Raul and Fino have. There is a misunderstanding as Fino declares, according to their cover story, that she is Raul`s girlfriend. They meet the branch manager and one of the store clerks, who already know who they are, and gloat at how they will eventually destroy Leon, which angers Fino and Raul, who declares that they are not to be underestimated.
Meanwhile, Sarah and Visor visit the manufacturer of a manufacturer of magical appliances attempting to get a deal enabling Leon to distribute their products. They see that they are able to get their costs so low by using monsters as slave labour, which is troubling from an ethical standpoint. They are then informed that Amada has just bought their company so they cannot agree to a distribution deal, and they were allowed to visit so that they would understand what they were up against.</summary>

<summary>Visor is shocked that there seem to be no customers, and while at first it seems that it`s because of the poisonous pond Fino put in front of the store, after they fill it in they realise that it is actually because Amada Magic, the largest chain of big box stores of magic items in the country, has just set up a branch nearby. Fino and Raul investigate the new store, and find to their dismay that it has a much a wider selection of goods and lower prices, so much so that Leon cannot profitably match them. They suddenly run into Airi who seems to be working there.</summary>

<summary>The volcano begins to erupt as Fino attempts to open the gate to the demon world and complete her transformation, and Raul and his party have to fly through a deadly rain of volcanic debris to get to her. They are attacked by harpies and other monsters as they approach. Lore is injured as their carriage is damaged, she remains behind to try to repair it with the old man as Raul, Airi, and Ram attempt to continue the rest of the way on foot. They find a cavern that leads inside the volcano and are attacked by hordes of monsters. Ram and Airi make Raul to go on ahead to face Fino as they hold back these monsters.
Raul has a battle with Fino as he attempts to get her to return to the way she used to be, even as the gate to the demon world begins to open and her transformation is nearly complete. He manages to reach her by reminding her of the eight basic phrases he taught her when she was learning how to speak to customers, and of the order she worked so hard to fulfil just before she was abducted. This lets Fino break free from the Bloodstone`s power and return to her normal state.</summary>

<summary>Fino has been brought to the former hero academy by a demon named Raid who is working with like-minded demons and former hero candidates like Ciel and Blaze who want to see her become the new demon lord. They have recovered the Bloodstone, which was the sign of the demon lord and was used by her father to subjugate lesser demons.
Meanwhile, Ciel has gone to the Leon store with a two-headed dragon and attempts to destroy it, only to be confronted by Sarah, who turns out to be ridiculously powerful, capable of turning any magic item into a powerful weapon: she was the one who managed to defeat the old demon lord.
At the same time, Raul has realised where they brought Fino, and he has a confrontation with Blaze, whom he quickly defeats. He finds Fino at one of the demon`s gate mock-ups they used for practice, chained to a pillar, but is attacked by Airi before he can free Fino. Airi has a hatred for all demons as they had killed her family, and she and Raul have a bitter battle. Fino, unable to watch her friends fight that way decides to accept the Bloodstone`s power and begins her transformation into the demon lord. She flies into the volcano where the gate to the demon world is.
Raul has by then managed to defeat Airi and convince her that what she is doing is wrong, and as they are about to chase after Fino, Raid tries to stop them, but just then Sarah, Visor, Nova, Lore, Elsa, Ram, and the old man Hiramatsu arrive, and Sarah fights Raid, allowing Raul, Airi, Lore, and Ram to leave on the old man`s carriage.</summary>

<summary>It is a typical day at work at Leon, and despite what happened before she is upbeat and buys even more strange things for helping attract customers by mail order, not realising that she`ll eventually have to pay for them. She tells Raul what her father was like, how he tormented not just humans but weaker demons like her mother, and which is why she never wanted to become the demon lord herself. She would rather become a Leon branch manager like Sarah, of the first branch in the Demon World.
During lunch break Raul joins his old friends from the hero training program Ciel and Blaze, and they tell him that the hero system will soon be restored as there will once again be a new demon lord. They were evidently the same ones who attacked Fino the other day. They depart on unsettling terms with Raul warning them not to lay a hand on her.
Meanwhile, while Fino is having her lunch at the convenience store, she sees a customer who wanted to buy a refrigerator whose complete details she was unable to get. She chases after him and gets him to fill out the missing details in his order form, but afterwards she is abducted. Raul returns from his lunch break to find that Fino has not returned, and while searching for her finds the order form, and realises that she has been abducted.</summary>

This is Fino`s first salary and Raul says that she should buy something memorable with it. She convinces him to come with her as she goes shopping, and she winds up buying a lot of strange things and spends all her money before he realises it. She gives him a small charm with the hair of a hero who nearly defeated the demon lord as a gift.
As they are heading home and Raul goes off to buy some drinks at a vending machine, he hears Fino being attacked, but her assailants run off as he runs toward them. She tells him that they told her to become the demon lord, and change the world back into one that needs heroes.</summary>
