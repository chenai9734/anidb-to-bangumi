<description>* Director http://anidb.net/cr703 [Murakami Teruaki] returns to boot up PIXY`s new "PIXY SPECIAL" label. This is a series based on http://anidb.net/cr1318 [Lilith]`s game of the same name.
It is an age where the human race has begun spreading through space. Mankind`s territory has expanded through the entire solar system. Before long, "humanity of space" will increase to the point where Earth will no longer be their native home. Until then, the Space Federation Government, which recognized the sovereignty of every colonized planet, was established to revise doctrines favorable to Earth.
The protagonist, Donny Bogan, is a lieutenant in the Space Federation Force and is captain on the battleship Jacinthe, used to transport VIPs. However, the protagonist and crew of Jacinthe are secretly in a special military force affiliated with the political group "Neo Terrors," the heart of "neanderthals" born on Earth. They have had the special task of assassinating and kidnapping key figures of the political clique "New Soral," the heart of "humanity of space" and whose interests antagonize their own. Their next targets are the up-and-coming talented women of "New Soral": Commander Lieri Bishop and her aide, Major Naomi Evans. For the sake of Earth, the women intend to ascertain evidence of illegal activities of the main statesman in the "Neo Terrors" and indict him if necessary before a Federal Government session on Earth. Therefore, the men made plans to brainwash the two beautiful commissioned officers through means of their most skilled duty and change them into personalities convenient for them. "Tomorrow we will approach Titan, pick up both of them, and head for Earth. We`ll use the equipment on this warship and brainwash them while we`re in transit."
The protagonist was in no small way linked to the women. With deeply etched memories of humiliation, the protagonist surgically changed his face and achieved his current social status to one day exact revenge. "Now, how should I change you... Lieri Bishop, Naomi Evans? I`ve always been thinking of a special plan for the two of you."
Jacinthe sets course for Titan and begins wading silently through the vast cosmos.

<name>maid</name>
<description>A maid is a female employed in domestic service. They usually wear uniforms. Since their nature is to be obedient and serve their goshujin-sama (master), they are one of the most desired types of women in Japan, a dream of every Japanese man, particularly http://anidb.net/t1133 [otaku]. Often seen in so-called Maid Cafes in Akihabara, where male customers can for a little time enjoy the feeling of being served by a woman. The male gender opposite is the butler.</description>

<name>content indicators</name>
<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>mammary intercourse</name>
<description>Mammary intercourse is a sex act, performed as foreplay or as non-penetrative sex, that involves the stimulation of the male penis by the female breasts. Commonly, this sex act involves the man placing his penis in the woman`s cleavage and thrusting between her breasts, while the breasts are squeezed around the penis for additional stimulation, and fellatio may also be performed in combination. Mammary intercourse is also commonly known as titty-fucking or titfuck in the United States, as well as tit wank or French fuck in the United Kingdom. The Japanese term, paizuri (from oppai, breasts, and the verb suru, used in this context to describe the sexual act), is commonly used in the anime fandom. A variant term is "naizuri" (a pun on nai, the negative of the verb aru, indicating existence/presence), which describes an attempt to do a paizuri, but with insufficient cleavage.</description>

In healthy humans the process of urination is under voluntary control. In infants, some elderly individuals, and those with neurological injury or extreme psychological problems, urination may occur as an involuntary reflex.

<description>Large breasts are breasts a fair notch larger than average, as found in some adolescent girls or fully grown women; however, as anime has no upper limit to breast size, the definition applies somewhat differently. To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<description>An erotic game (eroge) is a Japanese video or computer game that features erotic content, usually in the form of anime-style artwork. In English, eroge are often called hentai games in keeping with the English slang definition of hentai. This is sometimes shortened to H games. In Japan, eroge are also referred to as 18+ games. Most erotic games are visual novels or dating sims but are not limited to them.
Any anime adaptation of a game that contains (or had a version that contains) adult content (generally sex scenes), regardless of how some fanboys blabber on how "the story in that visual novel was too good to be labelled as porn!", should definitely get this category added under them. This should make it pretty clear as to what is an erotic game and what is not.</description>

<name>visual novel</name>
<description>The two terms are similar yet different, however, the fact that they look and `feel` the same outweighs the technical differences. For clarification, visual novels are considered a sub-genre of adventure games and the term does not cover simulations. While the two genres often share a common visual presentation, dating sims are sometimes considered to be more statistically based than the "choose your own adventure" style of visual novels; basically, the choices you make might change something else than just the story arc (or your next porn pic). Dating sims can involve several technical elements such as a time limit, several statistics such as looks and charm which can be boosted through exercise, or an "attraction meter" which can increase or decrease depending on one`s decisions.</description>

<description>The conspiracy thriller (or paranoid thriller) is a sub-genre of the thriller which flourished in the 1970s in the US (and was echoed in other parts of the world) in the wake of a number of high-profile scandals and controversies (most notably Vietnam, the assassination of President Kennedy, Chappaquiddick and Watergate), and which exposed what many people regarded as the clandestine machinations and conspiracies beneath the orderly fabric of political life.
The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top".</description>

She is a Space Federation Force major, from Planet Titan, and in the New Soral faction.
She is an investigator for the Armed Forces Military Police Investigative Department and Lieri Bishop`s adjutant. Her specialty is in operating the self-propulsion robotic soldier called the "gunturtle," which is said to be extremely difficult to learn. Naomi is a genius that can operate four machines at one time. She also excels at close-quarters combat and has twice been champion of a hand-to-hand fighting tournament on Titan.
From the outset, she was the eldest daughter of a mercantile family that dealt with the Bishop family, but starting from when she was a child, she has grown alongside Lieri and followed after Lieri on the path as a servicewoman. Needless to say, she enrolled in the same military academy as Lieri. Lieri is Naomi`s respected senior, and Naomi loves her like an actual elder sister.
Due to Lieri`s influence, she is of the old collective ideology that the Neo Terrors are savage and uncivilized.
Because of her excellence, she is high-handed and tends to look down on men and has caused much trouble with male servicemen.

<description>He is a Space Federation Force lieutenant commander and captain of the battleship Jacinthe, used to transport VIPs.
However, he is secretly a special operative belonging to the Neo Terrors and an unlawful agent that is executing missions of assassinations, sabotage, and the like.
Supposing that the protagonist is even interested in his own fame, he has absolutely no political ambitions and has no interest in both the Neo Terrors and New Soral, but he is attached more to the Neo Terrors` extent of depravity, which is more realistically human, than to the New Soral faction`s tenets and conduct, which is heard as hypocrisy.
The protagonist`s interests are in human brainwashing technology through the brainwashing device, "Memory Plant," and, in a sense, considers it being useful to his own fame. As an idea, he is also in a way intoxicated with the fearless deed of being a god and artificially creating an absolutely new personality.
In his past, he was imprisoned because of his failure on a mission that involved Lieri and Naomi, and after his release, he altered his face and came to be at his current position, determined to exact revenge on the two of them.

<description>The gunturtle is a self-propulsion robotic soldier officially adopted by the Space Federation Force into its land war force.
When it is moving, it is a 50 centimeter diameter mobile ball, when in combat, transforms to a full length of 150 centimeters, and it attacks while flying one to two meters in height via high powered blusters.
In order to manipulate the self-propulsion robotic soldier, a portable control console (something like a small laptop) is necessary, and the robot moves according to a simple program transmitted through the console. The program is modifiable as the occasion calls for it, but because the gunturtle can only execute simple basic movements and rules, the program changes depending on enemy movements. How the basic program is constructed to deal with complex situations and engage in combat is what defines a superior gunturtle user.
It is armed with one cannon of 20 millimeter rounds and two phaser machine guns.
It can fire up to a hundred 20 millimeter rounds and up to a thousand charges in each phaser machine gun. The phaser machine gun has power of an average 7.92 millimeter machine gun.
