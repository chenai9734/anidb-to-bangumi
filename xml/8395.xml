<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="78881">I picked up this series due to the "must see" recommendations. 

An anime with a gripping start with lots of promise, and great animations that unfortunately fails to deliver (after episode 10) mainly due to pacing, plot and character related problems. 

Hopefully those considering this anime a "must see" will study storytelling/novel writing/sequential arts and then revisit this series. For fans only.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="117590">Blooddy hell they animated it ? was my first response :D

Now, madness is a superpower as stated by one demotivational poster pretty well characterizes this thingy,since the manga is finished the will prbably stick to it ant it will be great :D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="355872">An hectic, terrifying and  gorgeous madness, which will blow your mind and will leave you stunned by fear like a scared rabbit.
The story beautifuly builds up. Just wait for it to take you away.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="518499">Good watch. Good action, characters &amp; story. Maybe the ending could be a bit better though.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="162375">So Far So Good.
I`ve read the manga and the anime is still following the manga. I hope they will fit the whole manga into 26 episodes.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="338795">Twisted to the core and mind boggling. If that is your cup of tea you will love it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="486670">Mirai Nikki is definitely really good choice. It has a lot of action, many turn over scenes and a lot of romance! I can`t say, the romance from the start of the anime till the half.. it`s kinda weird, but watch it till the end end you will enjoy it. Yukki (the main character) is really lame, i hate him... well even his character has a turnover! :D 
Yuno (the female main character) from the other side, you will love her..</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="527292">Okay I know everyone has alrdy said all the good points about this show but i just want to reiterate the point this show is AMAZING and a breath of fresh air for me anyway... love the characters (yuno is the best) and the plot it is jus a great show and cant wait to see the ending i know it wont disapoint!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="265326">This anime starts awesome , continues awesome , has some down points in the middle but DONT LET THEM GET TO YOU OR MAKE YOU CANCEL THIS SERIES!!!. I stopped watching when the characters and plot became a little annoying , continues after 2 week and i have to say . 
THIS SERIES IS SO AWESOME ! . the Last 10 episodes or so  are so epic , the twists the plot . everything . DO NOT DROP THIS ANIME AND HANG IN THERE its sure to get AWESOME</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="428263">strictly NOT for the faint hearted XD but it is a decent show this year</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="474925">I absolutely loved this as a fan of Another and Higurashi, but a warning to those who are sensitive to rape and implied rape. I personally didn`t care for that part, but it helps explain certain characters` behaviors. Overall, a very good show that I will be watching again.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="248649">Probably one of the most underrated anime of this year. Everything is really good, story, character`s background, music, draws.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="460147">The manga is better, this is one poor adaption with lame directing. Yet, the art is more nice looking then in the manga. So, I still recommend this, just don`t uphold too much expectation and treat it as pure entertainment, at least the characters are cute to some.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="553695">Ensky`s choice.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="253370">It`s pretty dark, and bloody (although parts are censored).  But overall story is not bad enough that you would put down, and you want to see the next episode.  It follows the manga pretty damn well, which I am thankful for, since it was a nice story, but on the flip side, b/c it`s soo close to the damn story, you are just listing to the VAs do their work, and animated blood spatter...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="316546">A very good psycho/shounen/slight horror anime. The first 1-16 episodes made me hooked but then it just goes downhill... nothing makes any sense, the pacing starts sucking bad timing on everything sadly ruins the good plot..</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="385974">wow I think this is the best anime in 2011 I don`t know why is it not so known I mean it didn`t make a fuss like Death Note .
Maybe Mirai Nikki is one of those hidden jewels that you won`t discover until you watch it</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="307450">Just finished the manga , I can tell that The anime is 99% sticked to the manga untill the 9th episode so i have a good feeling about this show :) Absolutly the best one for this year</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="586959">This anime had me on my seat focused on everything like i have never been before, a very twisted horror survival game between players with a big twist in the end you never see coming</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="131821">One of the best animes out there i just ratcheted it after 3 years and it was even better than first time its a must see for those who love horro fiction romance or Yandere
10/10</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="60976">Put mindf*ck, battle royale, lot of action that changing like in kaleidoscope and you got pie called Mirai Nikki. Go ahead and watch it. You won`t be dissapointed. Vote ? 9.75/10.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="543852">Very good, with a twist of mindfucks - however i was a bit dissapointed by Amanos fate in last ep. But definitely worth the time!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="598920">The anime itself is so so. But Yuno really makes it shine. Her development is one of the things one really has to see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="405614">FFS ! THIS AS AN EPIC STORY !!!!!!!!
this anime is underrated !!!!!!!!!!!
MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="233389">my first tought: The protagonist is so lame. I want to be stalked by this hot girl.
after a few episodes: God, forgive me. I didn`t know what I was saying.
conclusions: Great show, definitely must see. Yuno is a one crazy.... girl :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="435866">Ho ho ho! This was quite surprising. Good plot , bloody , exciting , weird , twisted with crazy characters , and quite good actually. The ending was also good , but not exactly "complete". If you want a more revealing ending , read the last chapter of the manga. Nonetheless , it was a good watch!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="443072">i loved this anime ,the codependence of the two main caraters drives this story very well and lots of plot twist, u might guesse the ending butt u can never guesse how they will get there.
i strongly recommend this anime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="496535">My favorite anime of 2011, animation is great, I truly enjoy all the characters I`ve seen so far, and the plot is not a convoluted clusterfuck that animes like these often spawn. The female lead is a great combo of psycho and intelligence, but you feel sympathy for her and want the leads to emerge unscathed. The characters are unique and memorable, a nice break from cookie cutter anime roles.

Suspense + some horror + psychological + slight fanservice + otherwordly element, its like Death Note in some respects but frankly I like this better thus far.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="60847">1. I read the Story and think: "What a Shit"
2. DL and Watch 2-3 EPs
3. Think "Amazing"</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="578744">other than the action in the last few episodes  the anime was quite impressive</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="61503">Really twisty and turny story which keeps intrest up constantly.

If you enjoy different stories like Elfen Lied, Saikano. You will most likely enjoy this.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="570475">This Anime makes me type all this and the following words: "Watch it!"  

Even though you might end up hating the Main Male character, the anime is so well executed that his actions speak his characteristics perfectly.  So does the main female character.

At first sight you might be confused, but when you finish watching this every thing is very reasonable.

The only weak point, if any, would be that the two Main characters are so glittering that they overcast all other characters.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="281995">The story has amazing moments, the animation and soundtrack is great, and the end wrapped  everything up in a pretty satisfactory way, in my opinion. Masterpiece!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="503773">i am absolutely stunned
words cant do this anime justice
the presentation of the plot was very nice but most of all i LOVED the romance (which was very...unusual)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="555526">One of the best animes i watched. Undescribable good. Everything was awsome, action, romance, plot twists, horror. MUST SEE!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="547633">Beautifully twisted.  I wasn`t sure what to expect walking into this, but I was never disappointed with what was served up.  The art is developed, the characters engaging, it really won`t take much for this series to get it`s hooks in you.</recommendation>

<name>insane</name>
<description>Insanity, craziness, or madness is a spectrum of behaviors characterized by certain abnormal mental or behavioral patterns. Insanity may manifest as violations of societal norms, including a person becoming a danger to themselves or others, though not all such acts are considered insanity; likewise, not all acts showing indifference toward societal norms are acts of insanity.
In modern usage, insanity is most commonly encountered as an informal unscientific term denoting mental instability, or in the narrow legal context of the insanity defense.
A more informal use of the term insanity is to denote something or someone considered highly unique, passionate or extreme, including in a positive sense. The term may also be used as an attempt to discredit or criticise particular ideas, beliefs, principles, desires, personal feelings, attitudes, or their proponents, such as in politics and religion.

<name>detective</name>
<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.

<name>horny nosebleed</name>
<description>In Japanese media, healthy young men who have no other sexual outlet will often suffer nosebleeds upon seeing the naked female body, or even just a pair of well-filled panties.
The nosebleed is, of course, a visual shorthand/euphemism for sexual arousal. It is commonly interpreted that way for males and females, with little trickles of blood indicating mild arousal, and gushing fountains of blood indicating erection/extreme arousal in both sexes. It can also be interpreted as shorthand strictly for erections in males. In that case, when blood shoots from the nose explosively, and in ridiculous quantity, the implication would be an ejaculation.

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<tag id="2606" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2018-11-05">
<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>In general usage, blackmail is a crime involving unjustified threats against a person or organization in order to make a gain or harm or cause material loss to them unless a demand is met. It may be considered similar to or a form of extortion, although some jurisdictions will consider them as separate crimes. Most often, blackmail involves the threat of revealing some secret to a given third party, which may be another person, a rival organization, or a state institution such as the police, or to the general public. In anime and related media, and more specifically in pornographic works, blackmail is also a device used to coerce people, generally female and often schoolgirls, into having sex with another or others; in such cases, it may be considered similar to or a form of rape.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

<description>The long-term plot of the program revolves around a group of characters whose numbers are being slowly whittled away by one means or another, usually by killing each other. In the case of some reality shows, this is a process of elimination intended to result in a single winner. In other shows, this is a dramatic device, designed to generate tension and conflict with which to drive the overall plot of an episode or Story Arc (if any); in these cases it is sometimes combined with Anyone Can Die to especially heighten the resulting excitement, even when the apparent main character may be protected by Contractual Immortality. Compare Gotta Kill Them All.

<name>gore</name>
<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<description>The theme/genre of survival typically depicts the act or process of continuing to live, generally in a hostile, possibly post-apocalyptic environment. Survival-centered media tends to be dark, set most commonly in a contemporary context, and generally leads either to small groups of people forming closely knit and functional units or to individuals turning against their fellows in a return to the survival of the fittest.</description>

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

<name>antihero</name>
<description>An antihero is a main character in a story who lacks conventional heroic qualities and attributes such as idealism, courage and morality. Although antiheroes may sometimes perform actions that are morally correct, it is not always for the right reasons, often acting primarily out of self-interest or in ways that defy conventional ethical codes.
A villain protagonist is where the leading character of the story (the protagonist) is also a villain; this is a fairly rare occurrence.</description>

<description>There is a male character in this anime that is overall not very manly. Most of the time he starts off as your typical high school student. In time there are, through major changes in his life, several more characteristics added to his personality. Usually these add up to be extremely pathetic and the character becomes quite annoying. This goes along with the viewers wish for him to get over it and do something about it. Hence, he should "Man the hell up!".</description>

<name>dreams and reality</name>
<description>This genre of anime is typically set in both the world as we know it (reality) and a world of dreams, mythology or imagination.
Sometimes this dreamworld is actually real, sometimes it is not. Other times what we think is the real world is the dreamworld, and vice versa. They are not always easy to distinguish from each other, neither by the characters nor the viewer.
Whatever is real, and whatever is reality, both worlds are integral in shaping both the plot of this anime and the development of the characters.</description>

<description>Describes TV shows, where parts of the scenes considered as too violent are blackened, blurred, changed to other static screen, or cut out completely.

<name>i got a crush on you</name>
<description>It happens when a person develops an interest in someone that seems mysterious, smart, sexy, cute, fun, etc. Basically just someone you would like to spend more time with. Crushes are usually one sided and they happen more frequently among middle and high school students.
A person with a crush usually has a hard time expressing or conveying his/her feelings to that other person. That other person is usually clueless of the situation. Sometimes that person knows about the crush, but feels annoyed or embarrassed by it for some reason.
Having a crush on someone does not mean you are in love with that person, at least not yet. Depending on the situation crushes could develop differently (for better or worse):
1) Larger scale interactions (love).
2) Dating relationships.
3) Scary obsession or stalker type situations.
4) Disappear over time or distance.</description>

<name>just as planned</name>
<description>A term usually used to describe a situation, where a seemingly smart and cunning villain sets up a plan that seems grand and impressive, but is actually long winding, ridiculous, and convoluted. And all of that just to trick his opponent(s), like the hero or anybody else, into doing things exactly as he planned. Suffice to say that the villain could have reached his goal by much shorter and easier means, it just wouldn`t seem as awesome anymore.
The phrase is also known as the original Japanese "keikaku doori" where keikaku stands translated for "plan" or "schedule", and doori for "in accordance with ..." or "following ...".
The phrase is a reference to http://anidb.net/ch301 [Yagami Light] from http://anidb.net/a4563 [Death Note], and his love for plans.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Amano Yukiteru sees his own life as if he were a bystander. His "No Difference" diary reflects that attitude. In a detached, neutral tone, the diary records the future changes in his surroundings every couple of minutes. This gives Yukiteru timely, detailed entries of the future around him and is perhaps the one of the most accurate diaries revealed so far. Its major flaw is that nothing short of a DEAD END will make the diary record anything about Yukiteru himself.
Despite his severe lack of social skills, Yukiteru, nicknamed Yuki, is a fairly normal middle schooler who has gotten in way over his head in Deus`s survival game. He has been marked by Deus as the one who has triggered impossible events and great changes to occur in the future. For that same reason, he is also viewed by the other diary holders as being the most likely to win the game, and is therefore the most dangerous player who must be taken out. Yukiteru possesses remarkable accuracy in throwing darts, which he practices every morning with several dartboards in his room. He prefers to eliminate the other holders by destroying their diaries utilizing his darts instead of using the simpler method of outright killing them with sharp, pointy objects; possibly because he is one of the few people who is actually sane.</description>

<description>Uryuu Minene is the secondary female protagonist, the Ninth Diary user and the protagonist of the side-story manga, Future Diary: Mosaic. An infamous atheist terrorist, Minene is a young woman who has hatred against organised religion particular God. Her hatred of religion stems from her past when she and parents were traveling in a city in the Middle East but got caught in a battle, which is hinted between Israelis and Palestinians, where her parents were killed in the crossfire. Blaming God for her parents death, she leads a crusade of destruction against those associated with God. Minene got involved in the Diary game when after a failed assassination to kill a Catholic Cardinal, she tried to escape but almost fell to her death but was saved by Deus who gave her an offer to save her if she join his game. Minene`s diary is the Escape Diary, which will chart out the best course of actions for her to escape whenever she finds herself in a dangerous situation. While it means she can escape anything, it is not perfect as the diary can only tell her how to escape if there are favorably conditions that allow her any chance to escape.
Originally, she wants to win the game to destroy religion worldwide but later mellows out after befriending Yuki and his friends. While she began as an antagonist against Yuki, she later became his ally, becoming a big sister figure to him and both of them hold no animosity with each other despite Minene was responsible for the destruction and deaths at his school and Yuki was the one who blinded her left eye. </description>

While claiming to be fighting for "Justice", his view of justice is very different as to him, justice is the one who wins. His tape recorder called the Justice Diary (正義日記 Seigi Nikki), has the ability to tell him what evil deeds that will happen in the future which range from normally criminal like plotting murder to the nonsensical like littering. Furthermore, his diary can hypnotize people by giving them illusions.
http://anidb.net/ch25306 [Yuno] kills him by decapitating him when he tried to kill http://anidb.net/ch36460 [Tsubaki] by suicide bombing.
A running gag with him is his real face is never seen, at one point going as far as to wear two separate bags on his head so as to continue hiding it even after having it removed.
He is named after the Roman god Pluto.

<description>The Sixth Diary user. A frail girl with bad eye-sight, she is the leader of the Omekata cult (御目方教 Omekata Kyou) where she`s serves as the group priestess. The scroll she carries is actually her Future diary called the Clairvoyance Diary (千里眼日記 Senrigan Nikki) which allows her to read what her followers see. However, Tsubaki does not trust what her diary tells her because what her followers see may not be accurate and her fear of traitors from within.
Tsubaki is introduced afterhttp://anidb.net/ch25305 [Yuki], http://anidb.net/ch25306 [Yuno] and http://anidb.net/ch36462 [Keigo] are invited to her cult`s shrine to help deal with a Diary user who is disguising himself as one of her followers and planning to kill her in exchange she surrenders http://anidb.net/ch25307 [Minene] to them after her cult captured her. http://anidb.net/ch25305 [Yuki] agrees to help her due to her condition and Tsubaki`s claim she has no interests in winning the game much to http://anidb.net/ch25306 [Yuno]`s jealousy. When the Twelfth diary user Yomotsu takes action to kill Tsubaki by hypnotizing her followers, http://anidb.net/ch25305 [Yuki] and http://anidb.net/ch25306 [Yuno] protects her and kills Yomotsu. However, Tsubaki betrays everyone, revealing she was using http://anidb.net/ch25307 [Minene] as bait to lure them so she could trap and kill them and tells http://anidb.net/ch25305 [Yuki] that she lied about not being interested in the game as she wants win and end the world as she hates it.
The reason she hates the world was because when she was young, her parents who were the original leaders of the cult were killed in a car crash and she was made the priestess. However, the cult`s second-in-command wanted the members of the cult not to leave so he had Tsubaki trapped in a cage and allowed the male members of the cult to rape her as part of a "ritual". The rapes traumatized Tsubaki with the only thing keeping her sane was a ball given to her by her mother but when she loses it during one of the cult`s gang rapes, Tsubaki finally had enough and wanted the world to end for making her suffer. After http://anidb.net/ch25306 [Yuno] helps http://anidb.net/ch25305 [Yuki] escape by cutting off Tsubaki`s right hand, http://anidb.net/ch25305 [Yuki] goes into hiding until Tsubaki orders him to show himself or her cult will rape http://anidb.net/ch25306 [Yuno]. http://anidb.net/ch25305 [Yuki] charges into the room where Tsubaki and http://anidb.net/ch25306 [Yuno] are and distracts everyone by throwing a ball, the ball Tsubaki lost, into the air and throwing a dart at Tsubaki`s Future Diary. Before her death, Tsubaki cries it was unfair that her ball came back now when she needed it the most.
In Future Diary: Paradox, Aru, who replaces http://anidb.net/ch25305 [Yuki] as the First Diary user is ordered by Muru Muru to reenacted the events above but instead, Aru refuses and does things differently by having Ai and Orin help him distract Muru Muru and the Omekata cult so he can bring Tsubaki out of the cult`s shrine. With Aru, Tsubaki learns from his investigations that her parents were actually murdered by the cult`s second-in-command because her parents wanted to end the cult and give Tsubaki a normal life. Due to his kindness and him teaching her that despite what she had gone through, there was still some good in the world, Tsubaki falls in love with Aru.
She is named after Proserpina, the Roman goddess of the spring.</description>

<description>The Third Diary user. Takao is a teacher at http://anidb.net/ch25305 [Yuki]`s school who is secretly a serial killer who wears a heavy bulletproof trenchcoat with a hat and mask that hides his identity. Takao`s diary is the Murder Diary (殺人日記 Satsujin Nikki) which gives him details on who his next victims are and where and how he kills them. While the diary helps him catch his victims and prevents them from escaping, it does not tell him what to do if his victims will fight back thus he can be easily defeated. He was killed by a dart http://anidb.net/ch25305 [Yukiteru] threw at his diary.
It is revealed by http://anidb.net/ch25304 [Muru Muru] that Takao repeatedly accidentally killed himself when she was presenting him with his Future Diary. First was when he thought she was a witness to his recent killing and sliced the phone, and then thinking the phone was evidence, he destroyed it again. She admitted she suspected he would be the first to go because of his paranoid personality.
He is named after the Roman god Vulcan.

<name>Houjou Reisuke</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The Fifth Diary user. Reisuke is a four year old boy who despite looking seemingly harmless, is very intelligent for his age and has a very diabolical mind. He sometimes speaks in third person with his hand puppets who talks with. Reisuke`s diary is the Hyper Vision Diary, a colouring book that gives a small summary of the activities that he will perform for the day. However, his diary only shows three entries for the day during the morning, noon, and night. Despite that, it has a certain advantage of giving Reisuke all three entries at the same time, which allows him ample time to carefully plot his next move, as well as some pictures drawn by him, giving him some source material other than writing.
Reisuke parents were members of the Omekata cult who both later committed mass suicide after the police raided their temple. However, Reisuke claims he never loved his parents since they neglected him and wants to win the game to be a "Super Elite" to prove he doesn`t need to depend on adults. But despite these claims, http://anidb.net/ch25307 [Minene] learned Reisuke did love his parents and was devastated when they died. After his parents` death, Reisuke is adopted by http://anidb.net/ch38711 [Mrs. Amano] as she was a friend of his father. Due to the fact http://anidb.net/ch25305 [Yuki] and http://anidb.net/ch25306 [Yuno] were responsible for the incident that led to the police raid at the Omekata temple, Reisuke plans to kill them first, holding them responsible for his parents` deaths yet at the same time, he grows fond of them in a uniquely sadistic way, even calling them big brother and big sister. He was then killed by a stab wound given by http://anidb.net/ch25306 [Yuno].
He is named after the Roman goddess Ceres.

<summary>Aru talks to Yuno through her surveillance feed, revealing he dug up three corpses from her garden, two of which had recently had their skulls removed. When he threatens to give this information to the police unless she releases them, the stress causes Yuno to alter her memory again, rendering negotiations moot. As Kousaka uses his cell phone to post his will in his blog, it is apparently turned into a Future Diary by the Eighth diary holder, who adresses him as an "apprentice". On Aru`s advice, Kousaka acts out his diary`s predictions, reaching an amnesiac Yuno, a catatonic Yuki and a bound Hinata in the control room. His appearance causes Yuki to recover, recalling how Yuno abducted him to keep him safe until July 28th. Yuno places the key to Yuki`s shackles on the floor and tosses Kousaka the control panel key, allowing him to free Aru and Mao. Yuno then takes advantage of Kousaka`s distraction and shoots at him with a crossbow. However, Yuki, having had his key kicked over to him by Hinata, frees himself and stops Yuno, leaving her behind when his diary predicts the imminent arrival of three diary holders, all apprentices of the Eighth.</summary>

<summary>Aru deduces that the Eighth`s diary is a server hosting and sending predictions to the blogs of her apprentices. When Yuki`s diary predicts an attack by three of them, Aru has him moved to Kousaka`s mansion. His plan is to lure the apprentices in, then deactivate the area`s cell phone tower, severing their connection to the Eighth`s server. Once the attack begins, however, Yuno appears and cuts the power to the tower remote control, wanting to defend Yuki by herself. Aru and Kousaka rush to deactivate the tower manually, while Yuki keeps Yuno in restraints. Two of Eighth`s apprentices, Marco Ikusaba and Ai Mikami, manage to corner Yuki and Yuno by the time Aru deactivates the tower. However, Marco and Ai reveal that they are also the "owner" of a bona fide Future Diary, which has remained unaffected. With no other choice, Yuki releases Yuno, who intimidates the couple into retreating. When the third apprentice sets the mansion on fire, however, Marco and Ai counterattack. Their diaries` ability to predict each other`s actions manages to overwhelm Yuno, resulting in her and Yuki getting injured and their diaries taken away. As Yuki and his friends are brooding in the hospital, they are approached by Uryuu.</summary>

In order to confuse them, he has Uryuu feed Yuki false information. Yuki`s father visits him in the hospital, but while Yuki`s away, he searches the room for his cell phone. Yuno overhears that he has promised to destroy it in return for the cancellation of his substantial debt and realises he is being used by the Eleventh diary holder. Marco, who`s learned all about the situation from Yuki`s diary, considers Yuki`s father a useful link to Uryuu and the Eleventh and calls Yuno, demanding that they bring Yuki`s father to an abandoned commercial tower. Once they arrive, Marco punches Yuki`s father and places Yuki and Yuno`s phones on a table. As Yuki futilely fights Marco, his father goes over to the table and breaks his phone. However, nothing happens. Yuno, who`s realised that the phones were decoys, attacks Ai and successfully retrieves both diaries. Just then, Marco and Ai`s apprentice friend sets off explosives. The floor under Yuki collapses and both his father and Yuno reach out to grab him. Meanwhile, Nishijima has uncovered the identity of Eighth, a children`s caretaker called Kamado Ueshita, and goes to search her orphanage.</summary>

Yuki chooses to take Yuno`s hand, while Marco and Ai run to the crumbling tower`s roof with Yuki`s father, intending to jump off with parachutes. Yuno catches up to them and once again tries to fight them alone, while Yuki hides and attempts to help her with his diary`s predictions. Yuno loses and has her phone taken away, but it turns out to be Marco and Ai`s decoy, which distracts them with false predictions. As a result, Yuno manages to critically injure Ai. Yuki`s father grabs one of the two parachutes and escapes the tower, but he runs into Yuki`s mother, who has been informed of the situation by Nishijima. When she threatens to turn him in, he stabs her. Yuki, Yuno and a dying Ai are trapped in the wreckage, but Marco attempts to free Ai despite having been mortally wounded himself. With Yuki and Yuno`s help, the debris is cleared out and Marco and Ai die together as the tower collapses. Yuki and Yuno escape using the second parachute, only to find that Yuki`s mother has died. Meanwhile, Nishijima has been unable to find Kamado`s Future Diary server.</summary>

<summary>In a flashback, Yuno is revealed to have murdered her parents, who used to discipline her harshly for failing to meet their standards. After she fell in love with Yuki, he became her sole reason to live. Yuki asks Deus to bring his mother back to life, but he reveals that he is dying and his powers have faded. Furthermore, unless a successor is determined soon, all existence will collapse. When Yuki`s father returns home, Yuki, who knows he killed his mother from his diary, demands that he turn himself in. However, his father points out that he has no evidence. The next day, Yuki goes after his father, expecting him to lead him to evidence. However, it turns out that Yuki`s father wanted to visit the site where his family was going to go stargazing before he turned himself in. As Yuki reconciles with his father, they are ambushed by agents of Eleventh and Yuki`s father is murdered. Enraged, Yuki fights back and manages, with Yuno`s help, to kill the attackers. Afterwards, Yuki declares that he is now determined to win the survival game in order to attain the power to resurrect his parents. When he tells Yuno this means he has to kill her, she calmly replies that she is ready to die for him at any time.</summary>
