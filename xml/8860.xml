<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="264842">Sora no Manimani meets Milky Holmes.

Not all that bad tbh. Animation quality is doable , The humor works ....most of the time. If you like milky , you`ll like this. 

Inside it`s genre it deserves a good score.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="121887">Underappreciated. It incessantly parodies shows from the 80s and 90s, some of them quite obscure to a modern viewer, which could be the reason. Despite that, the parodies are quite funny when you do recognize them, the crazy nonsense is more or less funny regardless, and behind the crazy nonsense, there actually is a plot of sorts, which gets satisfactorily concluded, something you don`t see often these days.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on a manga by http://anidb.net/cr9949 [Inugami Kira] and http://anidb.net/cr30655 [SCA-ji] serialised in http://anidb.net/cr23322 [Gekkan Comp-Ace].
Take one group of rabid fan girls with tenuous grips on reality, toss out all rules of proper social behavior, mix them together in a basement with more twisted anime parodies and allusions than you can shake a schtick at, and what do you get? Well, besides a recipe for disaster, if borderline delusional http://anidb.net/ch41724 [Todayama Kyouko] is in what passes for charge, you get the Asstronomical Club, where mayhem rules and the wall between the real world and total fantasy shatters at least once every five minutes! And as if things weren`t wild enough, let`s throw in a http://anidb.net/ch41725 [boys love manga fanatic] who always seems to end up in her underwear, http://anidb.net/ch48208 [a maid on a secret mission], http://anidb.net/ch41728 [a ruthless arch-enemy] whose goal is to have the club disbanded, and a cat as the faculty adviser! And then there`s http://anidb.net/ch41723 [Itsuki], who still inexplicably thinks this is a club for astronomy... Although to be fair, some of the members do seem to be robots/aliens and/or from outer space. One thing`s for certain though: the Student Council will most definitely not approve of what happens when the Insane-O-Meter redlines and freaky fan girls run wild in Ebiten!

<name>trap</name>
<description>A trap is a plot device where a male character is mistaken for a female, with the intention of sexually deceiving other characters and/or the viewer. This behavior does not need to be intentional by the male (it is often not intentional) or continually maintained by the male, but the occurrence is common enough to deserve this fetish-specific tag.
This is often achieved by portraying the male character as a female; primarily via their clothing and physical appearance, but also through his behaviour, and/or language. A male character misinterpreted by others as female, without action from the male (explicitly feminine dress or behaviour), is generally not considered a trap; instead they are likely just http://anidb.net/t2561 [androgynous].
The reverse case is known as a http://anidb.net/t1637 [reverse trap].

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Even though school clubs in Japan are not mandatory, there is some pressure from the social grid (e.g. fellow students, teachers) to participate in some kind of after-school activity, be it in sports or arts. Colleges also have clubs.
As a comedy element in anime, some students have joined too many clubs, and are thus constantly stressed out. There is also the element of social commentary, making it clear that you have to join a club, if you want to be part of the class. Since self-founded clubs need at least 3 members, the desperate search and advertising for new members can be cause for hilarity in anime.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Ikaros is a "Pet-Class Angeloid, Type Alpha" who becomes bonded to Tomoki at the beginning of the story, which is symbolized by the invisible chain leading from her collar to Tomoki`s hand. She displays a very submissive, melancholic personality and is completely subservient to Tomoki`s wishes. Ikaros possesses the ability to grant seemingly any wish through the use of several techno-magical cards. Despite her passive appearance, Ikaros has displayed moments of aggressiveness whenever Tomoki`s life appears to be in danger. She weighs 48 kilograms, stands at 162cm and her wing type is listed as "Variable". Her "Variable" wings are extremely valuable and are highly desired by Synapse. While she begins the series with a poor grasp of human emotion, she eventually begins to acquire emotions and begins to fall in love with Tomoki. The reason for this is because she has high battle and processing capability, but has low emotional control as a result. She has been shown to be willing to sacrifice herself if it means ensuring the safety of Tomoki.
As the story progresses, it is revealed that Ikaros is not a "Pet-Class" Angeloid, but is actually a "Strategic Battle-Class" Angeloid and is the most powerful of all Angeloids. She takes little physical damage when she is shot, can fly to speeds up to Mach 24, and is able to withstand water pressure better than most submarines. In the past, she was called the "Uranus Queen" (ウラヌス・クイーン) and terrorized Synapse due to her immense power and battle capabilities. She was originally sent to Earth as a weapon of judgement and is responsible for destroying the Tower of Babel.
Ikaros is seen to be with the only Angeloid who has a "Battle Mode". When she activates her battle mode ("Uranus Queen Mode"), her wings are engulfed in bright light, her eyes become red, and a halo appears over her head. Ikaros can generate a nigh-invincible energy shield called "Aegis" (イージス). She also possesses several powerful weapon systems: "Artemis" (アルテミス), a series of multi-directional homing energy projectiles fired from her wings, and "Apollon" (アポロン), a bow that can fire energy-charged arrows capable of obliterating a country in a single shot. She also possesses the ability to summon and control a third weapon called "Hephaestus" (ヘーパイストス), which is part of an anime-only weapon system called the Uranus System (ウラヌスシステム), which vaguely resembles a massive cloaked spaceship. Both were first used in battle against the twin Gamma Harpies, but only the Hephaestus cannons were shown and dwarf the Harpies` Prometheus in firepower and size. A running gag in the series involves Ikaros occasionally seen holding a watermelon, a fruit she curiously takes an interest in. This leads her to eventually grow a patch of watermelons in the garden. Ikaros`s name is a play on the Greek mythological character Icarus, whose fate (falling from the sky) can be related to Ikaros`s introduction into the storyline.</description>

<description>Chizuru is the Secretary of the Student Council. She has a tall and model-like figure. She is a mature woman who seems to spend most of her time being quite serious. However, she has a sadistic side to her, which is shown when she "brain-washes" Ken and Kurimu. Also, she makes a lot of references to her sadism in the anime. She loves to cuddle and "abuse" the President (Kurimu) in a little sister way, and is an avid reader. Sometimes, it is hinted towards her wanting to be involved with Kurimu. She is hinted towards having a couple part-time jobs despite being too young legally to even have a job. While she is identified as the cool, serious type, she can embrace her more cutesy side to her once hopping around dressed as a cute sheep. Chizuru and Ken met in autumn when Ken was suffering from a broken heart. Their meeting healed it and showed him compassion for others. Like the season she represents, she always seems a bit gloomy and hard to approach but has a certain elegance to her.</description>

<name>Astraea</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Astraea has been described as having greater battle capabilities than Ikaros, and possesses two equipments: the super-oscillating photon blade `Chrysaor`, and a shield said to surpass the defensive power of Ikaros` `Aegis`, `Aegis L`. However, unlike `Aegis`, `Aegis L` is unable to cover every angle possible, only being able to block certain directions at a time, and it covers about half the area of `Aegis` in terms of angles. Astraea`s weak point is that she was made entirely for close-combat, and thus is extremely disadvantaged against opponents with long-range weapons or attacks, as she has no ranged attacks whatsoever.
She is sent by Synapse to dispose of Tomoki after he violates one of their rules.
However, when she is ordered to eliminate Nymph, she breaks off her chain and betrays Synapse, engaging in combat with Chaos. </description>
