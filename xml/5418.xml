<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="278012">I`f you like action anime full of exposition on a budget that uses animation tricks to hide the lack of animation while attempting to make it seem fast and intense, then this is the anime for you! In fact the writing and direction is just as good!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="13836">I`m also very disappointed so far. Animation-Quality has dropped significantly, story is somehow confusing and not very consistent.&lt;br /&gt;Was very eager before I saw the first episode... but now I`ll leave it for the time being.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="242092">After watching the first series with great interest and anticipating the release of this second season, I must say that I was disappointed. Not with the story in general, But at the way they are handling the characters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For instance since the series changed almost all of the lead voice actors, from the deep and inflective characters of the first season to the happy almost kiddy grade humor VA in the second. The Voice actors have too much emotion and is massive change from the solome cyborgs personalities that made the show thrive in the areas where personality and struggle where key areas of the first season. &lt;br /&gt;</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="241409">Just as good as the first season. Too many people are nagging about art style and seiyuu and fail to see a great plot and further character development.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="315386">Alot of people are thinking the opposite of me, but i think "Il Teatrino" is the better gunslinger girl. forget the drop in things, i believe it;s an increase. they were much cuter in this.  and yes i don;t believe s1 has any connection to this at alll. change in art, and no flashback or mention of anything. i just enjoy it as it`s own.

this is what`s change make it`s own anime
-change in art
-not a continue of last anime (see below
-complete change of seiyuu (Japanese would never change seiyuu if it`s a continuation)
-totally not related to the 1st gunslinger. 

overall people are blinded.</recommendation>

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>Untrained and as yet immature, children are expediently thrust into the role of warriors to protect god, king, and country. Not having even finished school, they are inexplicably designated to elite status or roles, typically requiring months of training and years of experience. All the more so with "experimental" equipment or weapons of mass destruction.</description>

<name>cyborg</name>
<description>A cyborg is a cybernetic organism (i.e. an organism that has both artificial and natural systems). The term was coined in 1960 when Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline used it in an article about the advantages of self-regulating human-machine systems in outer space. D. S. Halacy`s Cyborg: Evolution of the Superman in 1965 featured an introduction which spoke of a "new frontier" that was "not merely space, but more profoundly the relationship between `inner space` to `outer space` -a bridge...between mind and matter." The cyborg is often seen today merely as an organism that has enhanced abilities due to technology, but this perhaps oversimplifies the category of feedback.
Fictional cyborgs are portrayed as a synthesis of organic and synthetic parts, and frequently pose the question of difference between human and machine as one concerned with morality, free will, and empathy. Fictional cyborgs may be represented as visibly mechanical (e.g. the Cybermen in the Doctor Who franchise or The Borg from Star Trek); or as almost indistinguishable from humans (e.g. the "Human" Cylons from the re-imagining of Battlestar Galactica). The 1970s television series The Six Million Dollar Man featured one of the most famous fictional cyborgs. Cyborgs in fiction often play up a human contempt for over-dependence on technology, particularly when used for war, and when used in ways that seem to threaten free will. Cyborgs are also often portrayed with physical or mental abilities far exceeding a human counterpart (military forms may have inbuilt weapons, among other things).
Real (as opposed to fictional) cyborgs are more frequently people who use cybernetic technology to repair or overcome the physical and mental constraints of their bodies. While cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals, they can be any kind of organism.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<name>neo-noir</name>
<description>Neo-noir is a style that prominently utilizes elements of the now declined film noir, but with updated themes, content, style, visual elements, or media that were absent in films noirs of the 1940s and 1950s.
Films noirs were typically crime dramas or psychological thrillers featuring a pessimistic worldview and starring conflicted antiheroes trapped in difficult situations and making choices out of desperation or nihilistic moral systems, with crime, especially murder, being featured on the majority of them. Some of the most obvious visual elements included low-key lighting, striking use of light and shadow, black-and-white filming, and unusual camera placement such as low-angle, wide-angle, and Dutch angle shots.
Film noir is often associated with urban settings, private detectives, femmes fatales, and bleak endings, but they are not necessary to the genre; a large number of these films, including some of the genre classics, take place in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road, feature neither character type, and have clearly happy endings.
Film noir and the early neo-noir would come to influence the formation of tech noir, a crossover of neo-noir and science fiction, in the late 1970s; some the most influencial tech noir works are the American movies Alien (1979), Blade Runner (1982), and The Terminator (1984). Tech noir itself would also help form http://anidb.net/t2861 [cyberpunk] in the early 1980s.</description>

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<description>Terrorism is, in the broadest sense, the use of intentionally indiscriminate violence as a means to create terror among masses of people; or fear to achieve a religious or political aim. It is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence during peacetime or in war against non-combatants (mostly civilians and neutral military personnel). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war.

<name>Franca</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Franca is the codename of an expert on bombs and explosive materials who works as a freelancer with her partner Franco. An idealist by nature, Franca has strong morals and dislikes those who would kill indiscriminately. As a team, Franca and Franco are known within Padania for the quality of their bombs, which are said to be impossible to disarm. Some within the Five Republics Faction do not trust them because of their freelancer status. They operate an auto repair shop in Milan as a front for their clandestine business.
Franca`s true identity is Caterina, a student who dropped out of her university in order to file a national lawsuit against the arrest of her father, who was imprisoned on charges of unspecified crimes. Shortly afterwards, the father died of suspicious causes during his incarceration. Convinced of her father`s innocence and angry at the Italian government`s apparent immoral attempts to silence political dissent, Caterina sought out various activists within Italy in an attempt to learn how to get revenge on the Italian government. At the recommendation of Mangello Marinov, a family friend, Caterina made contact with Franco, whose uncle was a well-known explosives expert. Although Franco was reluctant at first, he was soon moved by the strength of Caterina`s convictions. Caterina learned much from Franco and eventually took the name "Franca" as a cover identity since she would be working closely with Franco from then on.</description>

<name>Henrietta</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Left for dead after the brutal murder of all six members of her family, Henrietta is the newest addition to the Agency as the story begins. She was raped repeatedly next to the dead bodies all night, which had inflicted psychological trauma to her, making her suicidal. This could be the reason her uterus was removed, as she explains to Triela that she can`t have periods. Her struggle is the most developed of all the girls as she adjusts to her new life. Henrietta`s favorite activity is to spend time with her handler, Jose(Guiseppe?), and they are fond of stargazing together. Whenever Jose seems to turn his attention to other women (including the other cyborgs of the SWA), Henrietta becomes slightly jealous. This is due to Henrietta`s strong romantic feelings for Jose, as a result of her conditioning and the care he gives her. Her name is often shortened to "`Etta". While there are several scenes where she primarily uses her left hand (readjusting her bag from her right hand to her left before hitting a person with it; using a submachine gun with her left hand; eating using a spoon), she usually fires pistols using her right hand. Henrietta`s preferred weapons are the SIG Sauer P239 Two-Tone, the Fabrique Nationale P90 PDW, and the FN FAL (present in the manga only). With the exception of the Walther WA 2000 sniper rifle, and Jose`s Ingram MAC-10, both of which anime-specific, the Henrietta/Jose fratello use exclusively Fabrique Nationale and SiG weapons (Jose uses the FN Five-seveN).

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A former victim of a Mafia child smuggling group based in Amsterdam, Triela was one among many who regularly suffered abuse in the form of drugs, torture, rape and mutilation which was taped as a snuff film. She was rescued by a pair of Europol detectives, one of whom was her future handler, Hilshire. After being mortally wounded in a gunfight, Hilshire`s partner bravely used the last of her strength to perform CPR on Triela, enabling Hilshire to save the child`s life.
Extremely pragmatic with just a hint of rebellion, Triela has a sarcastic wit and prefers to wear masculine clothing. She serves as a sort of mentor to the other girls of the SWA and, of them all, she retains the most realistic outlook on their situation. She is given a minimal of conditioning, like Henrietta, and is collecting a great variety of teddy bears. Triela`s preferred weapons are the SIG-Sauer P230 SL pistol, the M1897 Trench Shotgun with the bayonet attachment, the H&amp;K G3A3 battle rifle, and the H&amp;K P7M8 pistol.</description>

<description>Once known as Fleda Claes Johansson, this girl was the daughter of a professor who enriched in her a love for books at an early age. It is unknown how she became acquainted with the Social Welfare Agency. In the beginning, Claes is confined to the Agency, unable to participate in missions with the other girls because her handler, Raballo, has died. She is used as a test subject by the cyborg engineers, who utilize controlled situations and equipment to monitor the usefulness of her implants. Claes wears glasses from her life before her cybernetic operation as a visual reminder of the promise she once made to Raballo and is knowledgeable and mature for her age.
Claes`s preferred weapons were the H&amp;K VP70M and the MP5K PDW.</description>

<description>Some time ago, a girl`s father`s business was about to declare bankruptcy. In desperation, her father decided to cash in on the large life insurance policy he had taken out on his daughter, Angelina. Her father set up an "accident" where Angelina was hit by a car while she was out getting groceries with her dog Perro. After the incident, Angelina was chosen by the SWA to be the first girl to undergo the cybernetic augmentation and conditioning process. Now known as Angelica, she later became a model for the refinement of the child assassin program. Unfortunately, Angelica was also the first to experience the problems of the conditioning process, especially long-term memory loss. Angelica does not understand the disinterest of her handler, Marco, and the conditioning process left her with an overwhelming desire for his approval. Angelica, unlike the others, was not chosen by her handler, and did not at first receive brainwashing.
Angelica`s preferred weapon is the Steyr AUG A2, after previously using the Beretta 84.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Jose Croce is an agent in Section 2, http://anidb.net/ch7620 [Henrietta]`s handler and http://anidb.net/ch14837 [Jean]`s younger brother. A former officer with the Carabinieri and son of a powerful Public Prosecutor (father, Giovanni) and Defense Attorney (mother, Carla), both of whom were killed in a terrorist car bombing with his younger sister, Enrica, whom Henrietta has a strong resemblance to. Jose is strongly against treating the children the agency "fixed up" as mere tools of vengeance and is quite aware of their propensity for feeling emotion and pain, as well as each having a separate consciousness.
The name "Giuseppe" is used only in ADV`s English adaptation of the manga; in the Japanese-language manga and anime, this character is named Joze (ジョゼ), which has been rendered as Jose and even Giuse for the North American DVD release from FUNimation. Both forms have the same meaning: they are translations of the name "Joseph".

<description>Jean Croce is an agent of Section 2, http://anidb.net/ch9616 [Rico]`s handler and http://anidb.net/ch14836 [Jose]`s older brother. Jean is also the leader of the handlers and a trusted advisor to Director Lorenzo, the head of the department. Jean`s childhood was strongly influenced by his grandfather, a hero of the Italian resistance movement in World War II. His father, a leading anti-terrorist prosecutor, wanted him to become a lawyer, but Jean wished to enroll in a military academy and then join the Army. His service with the Carabinieri, which includes both civilian and military work, may have been a compromise. Jean became engaged to Sophia Durante, a fellow Carabinieri soldier, who was later killed in the car bomb that also claimed his parents and sister. Determined on revenge, Jean joined Section 2 which also included his brother Jose. Whereas Jose shows affection and concern for Henrietta — treating her like the little sister he loved so much — Jean looks upon Rico as simply a tool for vengeance — a means to an end. Jean`s desire for revenge defines his being: he lives only to kill terrorists and is not above torturing them either. Jean can occasionally be quite brutal towards Rico: leaving her with a bleeding lip after he got angry with her; and pushing her aside in frustration when, due to an error of judgement on his part and through no fault of hers, his enemy Giacomo Dante escaped, leaving a trail of death and destruction behind him.

<description>Victor Hartman was a Europol detective from Germany tasked with inter-departmental liaison at Interpol HQ. He wanted to join the Child Abuse Regulations Section to help expose a child-torture group operating in Holland. However, his boss denied him the request on the grounds that he was "too soft" to deal with the sort of cases that the team came up with. Later approached by Rachelle Belleut, the two decided to investigate a warehouse where torture sessions were rumoured to take place. They received information concerning the child smuggling ring from Mario Bossi, a Camorra leader who had experienced an attack of conscience. In the course of rescuing a girl from a snuff movie, Rachelle was mortally wounded. Hartman and Bossi managed to rescue the girl and get her to hospital where she fell into a coma as a result of her experiences. The two men thus took her to Italy for treatment at the Social Welfare Agency, fooling the Dutch police who needed her in Holland as part of their case. Only later did Hartman discover that the girl, now called Triela, was to become a brainwashed killing machine. He was outraged but gave in to Jean Croce`s coercion and agreed to become her handler, changing his name to Hilshire in order to cover his tracks.

<description>A former Captain in the Carabinieri, discharged due to a leg injury, he was approached by Jean Croce to serve as Claes` handler. In return, Jean would ensure Raballo`s reinstatement to the Carabinieri after three years. During his time in Section 2, Raballo and Claes partook of activities outside the SWA, especially fishing. He also taught Claes the value of patience and rekindled her prior love of reading. However, some incidents led him to question the cyborg program and the way the girls were being used. He left the agency and contacted a friend who was a newspaper reporter, but Raballo was then killed — in a rather fortuitous hit-and-run. Since bonding with another handler was impractical, Claes was simply re-conditioned to forget about Raballo and take part in simple everyday activities like gardening or testing new improvements to cyborg development. When circumstances led her to take part in the capture of two suspects she was reluctant since she had promised to be good — though she could not remember to whom she had made the promise to.

<description>An agent of Section 2 and Angelica`s handler, Marco Toni suffered an injury to his left eye, which resulted in his suspension from the Criminal Police Central Directorate (DCPP) of the Polizia di Stato. His friend, Dr. Bianchi, recommended Marco to serve as Angelica`s handler. To help Angelica adjust to her new surroundings and all the surgeries, he created a fairy tale titled Il Principe del Regno della Pasta ("The Prince of the Land of Pasta") about a prince who ate only pasta. This fascinated his girlfriend at the time, Patricia, who later wrote and published an actual book based on the story. The conditioning process changed Angelica`s personality and effectiveness and her memories could become random: she would remember some events and forget others. This caused Marco to no longer feel any attachment her, though after her death he felt regret over how he treated her and promised that if ever paired with a new cyborg, he would treat her better than he did Angelica.

<description>Pinocchio is a professional assassin with a near-fanatical devotion to his foster father, Christiano. Much like his namesake, Pinocchio wanted to repay the old man (in this case, Christiano) who "created" him. Years ago, Christiano and "John Doe", a former CIA agent, eliminated the Polacco family in their own house. Later, they found an unknown boy, speculated to be "merchandise" of the Polacco family, in a hidden cellar of the house. Although he originally intended to use the boy as a "bargaining chip", Christiano eventually decided to raise the boy as his own. Personally educated by Christiano and taught the skills of an assassin by "John Doe", the boy, now named Pinocchio, committed his first murder at the age of ten(not unlike the child assassins of Section 2). Pinocchio conducted many high-profile assassinations on his foster father`s behalf, including the murders of eight politicians, five judges, and four financiers of the Italian government.

After his uncle`s death, Franco no longer felt the need to live until he was visited a month later by a young woman named Caterina. Impressed by Caterina`s resolve to change Italy for the better, Franco taught her his trade. It would be because of Caterina, later known as Franca, that Franco continued to supply explosives to activists as his uncle once did.</description>
