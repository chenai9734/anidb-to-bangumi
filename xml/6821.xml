<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter (Taketori Monogatari, 竹取物語), also known as Princess Kaguya (かぐや姫 Kaguya-hime, 赫映姫 or 輝夜姫), is a 10th-century Japanese folktale. It primarily details the life of a mysterious girl called Kaguya-hime, who was discovered as a baby inside the stalk of a glowing bamboo plant by a bamboo cutter, alongside riches in gold. The thumb-sized girl grew into a beautiful woman, and this was known all over the lands. Eventually 5 princes made their way to her to ask her foster father for her hand. Each of them got tasked with something seemingly impossible to fullfil to marry her. After all of them failed, the emporer came to see her, and fell for her beauty. His proposal was denied as well, telling him that she wasn`t of this country and thus couldn`t marry him. In the summer Kaguya-hime started to cry upon seeing the full moon. Her foster parents inquired on the matter and after a while she gave in, telling them that she was actually coming from the moon, and that she needs to return there. When the day came to return, the emperor sent many guards to her home to protect her from the moon people. They came and took her with them anyway, leaving the parents in sadness and tears. The heartbroken emperor wanted to send her a message, and went on to ask where he could find the closest place to heaven. This being the Great Mountain of Suruga Provice. The tale goes on saying that the name of the mountain, which we know today as Mount Fuji, came from the word immortality (fushi, or fuji), and the Kanji from the emperor`s army ascending its slopes, meaning literally "Mountain Abounding with Warriours" (富士山).
The anime or episode either takes on the whole tale of Kaguya-hime or just parts of it.</description>
