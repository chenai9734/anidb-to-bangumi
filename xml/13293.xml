<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="96490">Sharply observed and wickedly funny in a lighthearted and self-deprecating way. Episodic comedy. Animation is average, or it would get higher marks.
Main characters are very interesting, and as a josei it`s hard to find a good comparison. But if you like this short series, you`re among otaku friends.</recommendation>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

The timeslot was expanded from half an hour to a full hour in 2010, and now airs Thursday nights from 00:45 to 1:45.
noitaminA aired its first non-anime series in 2010, with the premiere of the live-action adaptation of Moyashimon.

<name>ensemble cast</name>
<description>A show with an ensemble cast focuses on a larger group of main characters in a single plot narrative; anime containing several segmented plot narratives (such as episodic or arc-based plots) are excluded. As such, it doesn`t really have a "main" or "lead" character; instead, every member of the central main character group plays an important part in the show`s grander scheme; no single character is more important or prominent than the others (equality of importance). Further, subplots (if any) lead by each character in the ensemble have equal weighting in importance (or lack of weight).

* In a show where no single main character is more important or prominent than the others, 4+ main characters is almost always an ensemble cast.
* A show with 3 main characters of equal importance is likely also an ensemble cast; equality of importance must be considered carefully.
* A show with 2 main characters of equal importance is generally not an ensemble cast situation; however, on an exception basis where neither main character is considered an antagonist, a 2-main-character anime may be considered an ensemble (e.g. http://anidb.net/a11829 [Kimi no Na wa.]).

<description>Another goddess and Nagi`s twin sister. Opposite to Nagi, Zange`s tree is still intact and located in a church`s courtyard, thus she is still able to catch and cleanse impurities by herself. The fact that she switched her character to that of a Catholic nun, as it is a stronger religion nowadays according to her, contributed to her divinity staying intact. Despite seemingly being kind and caring on the outside, she usually takes advantage of Nagi`s weakened state to torment her. The word zange in Japanese means `penitence` or `confession`.</description>

<description>When Negi retreats to the woods to gather his thoughts after a shocking confrontation with one of his students, the little magi is surprised to run into yet another of his charges, Kaede Nagase! Exuding a Zen-like calm and a maturity well beyond her years (not just because of her much discussed bust!), Kaede spends her free time training in the forested mountains. Exactly what she is training for, she will not tell. But at least she`s good at keeping information under wraps, because she soon figures out Negi`s magical secret! With Kaede`s wisdom and guidance, Negi may just be able to grasp some hidden truths! Springfield may be the teacher, but Kaede is responsible for the lessons today.</description>

<description>A pretty girl with a palatial estate, Class President Ayaka might seem like a girl to be envied! But a lot of her peers don`t know the sadness she holds in her heart after the loss of a family member early in life. Ayaka`s lifelong rival Asuna knows her secret and surprisingly takes steps to bring some joy into the blonde`s life. Of course, that joy also comes with a visit from a rambunctious group of junior high girls who end up wreaking havoc at her fancy home. A good student and a slight control-freak, Ayaka maintains a crush on Negi that often ends up putting the lad in some uncomfortable situations!</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Elias Ainsworth is a magus, http://anidb.net/ch80778 [Chise]`s master and fiancée. He`s a being with both fae and human elements, and his origins are still a mystery. Known as the Thorn Sorcerer, the other faeries see him as an abomination, something he doesn`t mind. He`s also known as "Pilum Murialis" among wizards.
He can control and also turn himself into shadows, and when angry enough, he takes on a more monstrous form. He can even change his head to a human`s using magic. Despite claiming to lack human emotions, after some time caring for Chise he has slowly developed a true fondness for her. However, his innate lack of understanding certain human emotions makes Lindenbaum call him a child.
He dislikes children, saying they don`t have magic powers, but they are talented in being able to see the true nature of things.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Hatori Chise is the apprentice and future bride to http://anidb.net/ch80775 [Elias Ainsworth]. Her father abandoned the family when she was young, taking her little brother with him, and eventually her mother committed suicide in front of her. Feeling unwanted by her relatives, she sold herself into slavery so that she didn`t have to worry about anything.
She is also a Slay Vega, a special magus who can draw magic from her surroundings and within herself, at the cost of dying young because of the strain in her body, hence why Elias took her in, hoping to prevent her death. She has about 3 years left to live naturally at most.
