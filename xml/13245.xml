<description>http://anidb.net/ch55319 [Onoda Sakamichi]`s team, Sohoku High School, won last year`s national tournament, the Inter-High. The upperclassmen who pulled the team have graduated. By inspiring, supporting, and lifting each other up, the new generation of team members won a ticket to the Inter-High and a chance at a repeat championship. Their rivals, Hakone Academy, former champions seeking to reclaim their crown, and Kyoto Fushimi, home to the monstrous racer http://anidb.net/ch62221 [Midousuji], have gathered at the race, where they`ll clash in a fierce battle for victory! Every racer carries his hopes and dreams in his heart. As sprinters who race along straight lines, climbers who are masters of the mountains, and aces who lead their teams to victory... The "GLORY LINE" is each racer`s finish line of honor and glory, but who will be the first to cross it?!

<description>In the context of manga and associated media, shounen, literally meaning "youth" and often also specifically "boy", refers to a male audience roughly between the ages of 10 and 18.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<summary>The dead heat between Midousuji and Naruko at the front of the race continues! Behind them Kuroda pulls as hard as he can, but the two in front of them remain out of sight. Saying "Hakone Academy has nothing left to lose," Ashikiba, who had only been pulled until now, switches places with Kuroda and begins his Metronome Dancing. They are rapidly closing the gap. Imaizumi also pedals as hard as he can so he can support Naruko. Midousuji, Naruko, Kuroda, Ashikiba, and Imaizumi... The time has come for these five men who have steeled their resolve to settle the score!

<summary>Kuroda`s pulling puts Hakone Academy in the lead as the competitors head towards the first day`s finish line, but Sohoku`s sprinter turned all-rounder Naruko Shoukichi shows off his strengths! By demonstrating a new special ability that allows him to go quickly even while racing uphill, he doesn`t back down from the challenge. Told by Teshima to decide between themselves who will be the ace, Imaizumi and Naruko act more like rivals racing against each other than teammates working together, while Kuroda and Ashikiba demonstrate their battle-hardened coordination. Meanwhile, the shadow approaches from behind both teams...

Hakone Academy believed Sohoku would have a late start on "Black Cat" Kuroda and his exceptionally flexible legs, but two-year duo Imaizumi and Naruko chase after him. In the intense final phase of the race, the battle for the finish line finally begins!

Sakamichi and Teshima pedal to catch up to Imaizumi and Naruko in the lead, but Kaburagi notices he`s feeling strange. Meanwhile, Hakone Academy maintains a slow pace in order to meet up with their shot caller Kuroda. Not feeling well, Kaburagi is eventually separated from his team. When Sakamichi tries to go help him, Teshima stops him, fearing how Hakone Academy will respond. Then Aoyagi opens his mouth...
