<name>pirate</name>
<description>Pirates are people who attack ships on the high seas to rob others of their treasure. Well, at least usually. Other people calling themselves pirates are not unheard of, usually focusing on the freedom and romance involved in the piracy-related tropes and cliches. They may or may not be after the One Piece or a spaceship full of diamonds, too, if that`s what they see as treasure. Real-life pirates were extremely common a few centuries ago, and countries even sponsored their own pirates, called "privateers", to attack ships with flags of other countries. Nowadays, however, very few actual pirates still exist, and they rely more on terrorism and guerrilla warfare than anything else, demanding ransom in exchange for hostages instead of openly attacking the enemies with their swords. Another, more modern meaning for the word refers to people who illegally download copyrighted works they are not entitled to have a copy of. Be whichever it may, there are pirates around here. Arr, avast! Thar be pirates in these dark waters, matey!</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>adventure</name>
<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<description>Monkey D. Luffy is a fictional character and the main protagonist in the anime and manga series http://anidb.net/a69 [One Piece] created by http://anidb.net/cr4013 [Oda Eiichiro]. He is a boy whose body is made of rubber after he ate a http://anidb.net/t2518 [devil`s fruit] and acquired the accursed ability.
In the anime and manga, Luffy is captain of the http://anidb.net/ch1954 [Straw Hat Pirates], a group of pirates he assembles himself as he quests to find the "One Piece" and become the King of the Pirates. His primary motivation throughout the series is to reach the goal with all of his comrades, a task he pursues no matter what stands in his way. While he is goofy and reckless, he gets quite serious when anyone is in serious danger, notably his crew, whom he considers his friends. Luffy has additionally appeared in all of the featured movies in the series and other media relating to the series, including several video games and specials.
His blood type is F in XFS blood group system used in his world. It is equivalent to B in ABO blood group system.</description>

He is famed as a master swordsman, user of the Santouryuu style, and his great strength sometimes leads others to believe he must be the true captain. Being labeled as one of the "Monster Trio", he`s one of the top three fighters in the crew. Zoro is currently one of eleven pirates who have been referred to as "The Eleven Supernovas", having a bounty of 120,000,000 beli.</description>

<description>Nami, nicknamed Thief-Cat Nami, is the crew`s 18-year-old navigator and thief. She has the ability to recognize and analyze even the slightest changes in the weather up to the point of sheer intuition. She is also an excellent pickpocket. Her dream is to draw a complete map of the world. Throughout the series, Nami fights using a bou-like staff that is made up of three connectable segments. http://anidb.net/ch478 [Usopp] later provides her with a version of this weapon capable of controlling weather, called the Clima-Takt ("Climate Baton" in the English manga and as "Weather Forcer" in the 4Kids dub). Even later, Usopp augments the Clima-Takt with dials, making it more powerful. Nami ranked in the Top 10 of all three Shounen Jump character popularity polls. Her backstory has been found to be a "touching story" as it "unfolds with a lot of emotion" by Mania Entertainment writer, Jarred Pine. Pine also mentioned Nami was his favorite character from the series, and satisfied with how the manga showed her past. While reviewing the 8th DVD from Viz Media, Activeanime mentioned Nami is one of the best characters from the series as "She`s got guts, smarts, and can heft a mean punch when needed". Like Pined, Activeanime liked Nami`s background and added that his "itty bitty heart went out to her".
When a reader asked http://anidb.net/cr4013 [Oda] who Nami is in romantic love with, Oda answered that there will not likely be any romance among the http://anidb.net/ch1954 [Straw Hat Pirates]. Oda explained that he does not portray romance in http://anidb.net/a69 [One Piece] as the series is a shounen comic, and the young boys who read the comic are not interested in romance.</description>

<description>Usopp, nicknamed "Sogeking", "King of Snipers Sogeking" (Sogeki no Ou-sama; "Sniperking" (Viz manga) is the 17-year old marksman of the http://anidb.net/ch1954 [Straw Hat Pirates]. His name comes from Uso, which means liar in Japanese, and Aesop, the author of The Boy Who Cried Wolf. He is a liar, talented inventor, as well as a skilled painter and sculptor. His primary weapon is a slingshot, which he uses to fire various kinds of ammunition, ranging from rotten eggs and shuriken to hot sauce, flaming, and exploding projectiles. Later, he creates himself a large, dial-powered slingshot he calls Kabuto, with which he is able to out range even guns. Usopp`s father, http://anidb.net/ch688 [Yasopp], left his family to become a pirate when Usopp was still very young. Some time after this, Usopp`s mother, http://anidb.net/ch648 [Banchina], fell ill. Usopp started telling lies, stating that his father had returned and would be taking them with him. His mother eventually died, but Usopp, in his sadness, continued to lie. Despite all this, he does not blame his father for leaving him, but takes pride in his heritage. He is inspired by http://anidb.net/ch474 [Luffy], http://anidb.net/ch475 [Zoro], and http://anidb.net/ch476 [Nami] and decides to go out to sea, following his dream of becoming a "brave warrior of the sea". His weakness as a fighter weighs heavily upon him and when after the crew is defeated and almost destroyed by http://anidb.net/ch3168 [Admiral Aokiji], Luffy decides to replace the badly damaged http://anidb.net/ch2028 [Going Merry], the Straw Hats` first ship, which is given to them by Usopp`s friend http://anidb.net/ch643 [Kaya], a girl from his village that he used to cheer up with his lies, Usopp goes so far as to temporarily leave the crew.
Usopp ranked in the Top 10 of all three Shounen Jump character popularity polls. In a 2007 Oricon poll, Usopp was voted the 10th most wanted character to receive a spin off amongst all respondents, and the 5th most popular amongst males. In a review of Funimation Entertainment`s second DVD release for Mania Entertainment, Bryce Coulter notes that Usopp "brings lots of comic relief to the series", but also comments that he "can be down right annoying at times".</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Nico Robin, nicknamed "Demon Child" (悪魔の子, Akuma no Ko) by the http://anidb.net/ch1974 [World Government] is the 28 years old archeologist of the http://anidb.net/ch1954 [Straw Hat Pirates] Growing up alone on the island Ohara, home of the world`s largest and oldest library, she became an archeologist at age eight and learned how to decipher the writings on the ancient stones called Poneglyph, which are scattered around the world. After the World Government destroyed Ohara for housing archeologists along with her returning mother, http://anidb.net/ch2887 [Nico Olivia], researching these stones, Robin spent twenty years on the run, cooperating with various pirates and other outlaws and became a member of http://anidb.net/ch2939 [Baroque Works] nicknamed as "Ms. All-Sunday"; Ms. Sunday (4Kids dub) at the time, being briefly an antagonist to the Straw Hat Pirates before joining them. Like the scholars of Ohara before her, it is her dream to find and decipher the Rio Poneglyph, which is said to tell the world`s lost history. Her devotion to history and its preservation goes so far that she will even risk her life to protect ancient artefacts and buildings. She ate the Flower-Flower Fruit, allowing her to create copies of any of her body parts on any surface that she can see. However, if her replicated parts are hurt, she feels the pain on her actual body.</description>

<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="4">Vessel</charactertype>
<description>The Going Merry was the first ship of the Straw Hat Pirates that they used as their main mode of transportation through the East Blue all the way to Water 7, where she was replaced by the Thousand Sunny. She is a caravel class ship designed by Merry and given by Kaya to the Straw Hats as a reward for saving her. Over time, the ship came to be loved by the crew as a home and as a friend, so much so that she literally took on a life of her own and became just as much a part of the crew as any of them. Unfortunately, the Going Merry took an inordinate amount of damage during her "lifetime", being blown up, impaled, and even sliced up multiple times. Eventually, the Going Merry could no longer continue and received a Viking funeral.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Matsuge was the camel who accompanied the http://anidb.net/ch1954 [Straw Hats] during the Arabasta arc. He would only let http://anidb.net/ch476 [Nami] and http://anidb.net/ch2940 [Vivi] ride, and, in her admiration, Nami named him "Eyelashes". He refused to let anyone else on, prompting the rest of the crew to beat him up and label him as a pervert (because he only let the two women ride). He also disguised himself as Vivi by riding a Spot-Billed Duck and wearing a white cape. He was paired up with http://anidb.net/ch478 [Usopp] and got chased by http://anidb.net/ch3020 [Mr. 2]. He was as weak as Usopp since Mr. 2 only needed one second for each of them. After the Arabasta arc, Eyelashes was ordered to be given special treatment, as well as being allowed to join the Super Spot-Billed Duck Squad (even though he`s a camel), as revealed in the cover of Chapter 271.</description>
