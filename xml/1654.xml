<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="362596">It took me long enough to break down and watch this one...but I am so glad I did . It had a refreshingly interesting plot and I found I just couldn`t shut it off. Each character is endearing in their own way...or deliciously despicable. I found myself wanting to exact my own personal revenge against "Fliday Monday" . If a series can draw me in emotionally and make its mark...I definately owe it to others to recommend it. This is one of the top 25 for me.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="47940">Many people judge MADLAX badly because they always compare it with Noir. But if you take it as it is (and try to keep Noir aside), this truely is a master-piece of music-anime-interaction! If you like Kajiura Yuki, you must watch this!</recommendation>

<description>Madlax is from the director and character designer of Noir, and shares many similarities. The writer for Madlax is Kuroda Yousuke, famed writer of sCRYed, Infinite Ryvius and Gungrave. Kajiura is composing and Bee Train is once again animating.
The story revolves around two female leads.
The younger character, http://anidb.net/ch9901 [Margaret Burton], is a daughter in an aristocratic family in a peaceful European country. She has no freedom of her own and her only companion is her maid Elenor. It seems that some aircraft accident 12 years ago caused her to lose her memory before then.
The other character, http://anidb.net/ch9900 [Madlax], is a nameless elite agent with no past who fights in war-torn countries filled with chaos. It`s also mentioned that the war-torn country in particular is located in Asia with jungle enviroments. No one knows Madlax`s true name or age and she is a true combat specialist in the field.
The theme of Madlax is supposed to be war and how it affects people and the consequence/tragedy of murder, violence and lawlessness. The two characters are supposed to be parallels of lifestyles.

<name>amnesia</name>
<description>The character suffers from some kind of amnesia (memory disturbance or loss). This may mean inability to memorize new information, or inability to recollect old memories. Since there are many types of memory, the person may e.g. forget who they are but still retain learned skills.
Amnesia is fairly common in fiction as a plot device. In fact, because it allows for major plot changes while requiring little creativity from the author, it may be subject to heavy overuse.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>The thriller is a genre of fiction in which tough, resourceful, but essentially ordinary heroes are pitted against villains determined to destroy them, their country, or the stability of the free world. The hero of a typical thriller faces danger alone or in the company of a small band of companions. The protagonist may be a law enforcement agent, a journalist, or a soldier, but typically he or she is cut off from the resources of "their" organization. More often the hero is an ordinary citizen drawn into danger and intrigue by circumstances beyond their control.

<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<name>neo-noir</name>
<description>Neo-noir is a style that prominently utilizes elements of the now declined film noir, but with updated themes, content, style, visual elements, or media that were absent in films noirs of the 1940s and 1950s.
Films noirs were typically crime dramas or psychological thrillers featuring a pessimistic worldview and starring conflicted antiheroes trapped in difficult situations and making choices out of desperation or nihilistic moral systems, with crime, especially murder, being featured on the majority of them. Some of the most obvious visual elements included low-key lighting, striking use of light and shadow, black-and-white filming, and unusual camera placement such as low-angle, wide-angle, and Dutch angle shots.
Film noir is often associated with urban settings, private detectives, femmes fatales, and bleak endings, but they are not necessary to the genre; a large number of these films, including some of the genre classics, take place in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road, feature neither character type, and have clearly happy endings.
Film noir and the early neo-noir would come to influence the formation of tech noir, a crossover of neo-noir and science fiction, in the late 1970s; some the most influencial tech noir works are the American movies Alien (1979), Blade Runner (1982), and The Terminator (1984). Tech noir itself would also help form http://anidb.net/t2861 [cyberpunk] in the early 1980s.</description>

In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Limelda Jorg is a second lieutenant of the Gazth-Sonikan Royal Elite Guard and the most prolific sniper in the country (with the exception of Madlax). She initially enlisted after her relatives were killed by Galza.
As a member of the Royal Elite Guard she is assigned to protect Commander-in-Chief of the Royalist Army Guen McNichol who is assassinated by Madlax. After that and after `duel` with Madlax Limelda considers her as her rival and starts to be obsessed by her and her unbelievable talent. Later on she meets Carrossea Doon and is assigned (by himself alone) as his assistant and bodyguard - all that for only one purpose, they both want to meet Madlax (again). Despite multiple chances to kill Limelda, Madlax has always let her go and eventually shared with her the data she discovered on Enfant`s involvement with Gazth-Sonikan war. This revelation shattered Limelda`s world view and made her quit the Army and deepen her obsession in Madlax that leads to renew the attempts to kill her in a crazy hope that once she is dead, everything will return to `normal`. This strange way of thinking has its own logic covered within human Essence. At the end Limelda is asked by Madlax to `watch over her until the end` so Madlax can live within her - to become part of Limelda`s soul.</description>

<description>Vanessa Rene is Margaret`s former neighbor and tutor, who has received a university education in IT and is currently a manager for Bookwald Industries. Some reviewers have estimated her age as early thirties.
Vanessa`s goal is to uncover the real reasons of the conflict in Gazth-Sonika. Being a strong-willed and self-confident woman, she travels there herself and receives Madlax as her bodyguard.
Her parents got mixed up with Gazth-Sonikan politics when the war broke out and were subsequently executed, that is why Vanessa has a personal interest in discovering the truth. Having met Madlax, it is Vanessa who links the two personae of the original Margaret Burton back together.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>An independent contract worker for Bookwald Industries, although, in reality, he is one of Enfant`s best operatives and the right-hand man of Friday Monday himself. Carrossea is smart and resourceful and he often exploits his position and powers in order to search for clues about his past, for he, just like Madlax and Margaret, doesn`t remember anything before twelve years ago. During the incident in Gazth-Sonika, Carrossea, then known as Poupee, and Margaret were the sole survivors of the plane crash (maybe because both possessed the Gift). He rapidly fell in love with and vowed to protect her, therefore, when Margaret interrupted the stand-off between her father and Monday, Carrossea-Poupee has to cover her with his own body from a stray bullet and died on the spot. However, his rather weak Gift, the power of the Sanctuary and his will to protect Margaret sufficed to partly resurrect him at expense of his memories. Friday Monday has found his amnesiac persona, named him "Carrossea" and made his personal assistant, whereas his memories remained confined to the Sanctuary with the entity named "Poupee". Common past is probably the reason of the rapid mutual trust that appeared between Carrossea and Margaret upon their "first" meeting as personae.</description>

<description>Chris Krana is an alleged teenage son of Galza`s leader Min Durk and a Nafrecian woman, whose maiden name he adopted. After his mother`s death, Chris tried to travel to Gazth-Sonika to meet with his father (whom he never knew personally), but Enfant prevented him from entering the country. In the end, a Nafrecian civil servant Piederico Moré secretly "smuggled" Chris into the country and hired Madlax as his bodyguard.
With Madlax`s help, Chris reached Galza`s headquarters, but hasn`t found his father there. Instead, Friday Monday explained to him, that Min Durk was just a red herring created by Enfant, and that he, Chris Krana, thus, cannot exist. Krana`s ultimate fate is unknown.
In episode 21, while Carrossea and Margaret perform the ritual, a young Chirs Krana appeared with Margaret and Poupée during the plane crash in 1999, this explains most of Krana`s mysteries.</description>

<description>Badgis is a friend of Vannessa Rene, and an expert computer technician - in other words, a hacker. He has unlimited access to a super-computer he and his students built for scientific purposes. He lends a hand in Vanessa`s search for evidence of Bookwald`s involvement with the Gazth-Sonikan war. Using his machine, the two of them slice into the Bookwald mainframe and retrieve the necessary data; however, Friday Monday intercepts their attack and Badgis is forced to shut down his system. What happened to him afterwards is unknown. Apparently, Badgis has some romantic interest in Vanessa.</description>
