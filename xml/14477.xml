<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="342700">I really liked it, it`s really different than most of Isekais in some way. Strong focus on comedy. But I really wonder if we can call MC overpowered, since nearly every of his enemies is stronger than him? He needs to run away, train and than face them again... more like common shonen than typical Isekai. Still highly recommended, I would say it`s fresh air in Isekai`s genre!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="73747">Many anime shows have done this before... overpowered MC gets summoned to another world, but what`s different is his cautious nature that leads to many hilarious moments.  The characters, adventures and pacing are good.  The ending was satisfying as well, its one of those endings that if it got another season, I`d watch it, but if it ended here, it was a good ending for this show.  In the end, if you`re looking for an adventure anime with good amounts of comedy, this is a fun watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="589244">Oh my gosh, it`s so funny (not in the burst out loud laughing kind). It`s the first time I felt comfortable adding a recommendation less than halfway through the first ep. First, the animation of the goddess plus her speech and demeanor is very funny. The button she hands him was funny too. It`s been a while I`ve seen such simple comedy.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="114373">Another isekai series with comedy aspect. The storyline are quite ordinary in the begining, but as the story progresses, it kinda hooked into me. The ending was somehow satisfying. Could develop into second season, or probably not. But still an enjoyable shows nevertheless.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="763681">This is JUST a heads up, but you might want to stop watching after ep 10. The ending, episode 11 specifically, ruins the entire anime. I`m warning you since there are "people" saying that the ending is actually good, which may lead you to mistakenly look forward to it. DON`T! or your disappointment will be MASSIVELY STRONG. 

And it`s all just to (possibly) make a second season. I mean there is no other reason then greed, pure greed to ruin story and characters with a asspull forced drama dude exposition lmao flashback. But of course the studio needs that money, it really does.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="117590">Silly, over the top, funny as hell whats not to like :D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="173070">I`m a little torn at this one. There were plenty of humorous moments which emphasized the actions of the MC. At the same time, as the series came to a close, I felt that a lot of the driving factors of the characters were more or less cast aside. There`s good reasoning for it, but it felt like a bit of a betrayal to the characters.

Having said that, the characters flowed very well in terms of the situations in which they were placed and how they interacted with one another.

In the isekai world of series, it`s pretty mainstream in terms of quality. It was a good watch. If you enjoy the genre, you`ll probably enjoy it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="109723">Excellent isekai. Takes all the RPG themes and presents the hero journey. The show is very fast-paced with every minute of the show respecting your time. The story is very straight forward and keeps you going with the gag comedy. The final two episodes are worth the entire show. With a very rare in the anime world a surprisingly good ending.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on a light novel series written by http://anidb.net/cr56628 [Tsuchihi Light] and illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr19436 [Toyota Saori].
Young goddess http://anidb.net/ch105343 [Ristarte] isn`t sure if she lucked out or not when she`s chosen as the goddess in charge of finding a hero to save S-ranked world Gaeabrande. She`s only summoned five heroes before, and never for a world of this difficulty. Because of the prevalence and popularity of isekai novels in Japan, she decides to summon a Japanese hero to help her, and eventually stumbles across the stats of http://anidb.net/ch105344 [Ryuuguuin Seiya], who stands out not only for his unusual name, but also his high starting scores. Rista quickly summons him, but it turns out that she really should have read the fine print – Seiya may be powerful, but he`s also overly cautious to a fault, refusing to even set foot in Gaeabrande until he`s exercised his way to a higher level. When he won`t even eat the food Rista makes for him in case she might be trying to poison him, Rista realizes that she may be in trouble with this guy...

<name>horny nosebleed</name>
<description>In Japanese media, healthy young men who have no other sexual outlet will often suffer nosebleeds upon seeing the naked female body, or even just a pair of well-filled panties.
The nosebleed is, of course, a visual shorthand/euphemism for sexual arousal. It is commonly interpreted that way for males and females, with little trickles of blood indicating mild arousal, and gushing fountains of blood indicating erection/extreme arousal in both sexes. It can also be interpreted as shorthand strictly for erections in males. In that case, when blood shoots from the nose explosively, and in ridiculous quantity, the implication would be an ejaculation.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>adventure</name>
<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

The new world is commonly a http://anidb.net/t2628 [fictional world], such as a http://anidb.net/t2838 [parallel world] or http://anidb.net/t2839 [virtual world] (other fictional world types can also apply). What defines the isekai genre is that the characters are sent to another world, often but not always a parallel one, and they generally cannot come back permanently without meeting a highly specific goal.
In order to adapt to their new environment, they must use the abilities and knowledge brought from their former world as well as any that may have been bestowed upon them by their brave new world. In some cases, they will seek and eventually find a way to return; in others, they will gleefully embrace their new life.
http://anidb.net/a144 [Inuyasha] is an example where isekai applies to a fictional world that is not also a parallel or virtual world. http://anidb.net/ch7246 [Higurashi Kagome] climbs down an ancient well at her grandfather`s shrine and is transported to feudal Japan (time travel). While she eventually gains the physical ability to travel back and forth between her time period and feudal Japan, her bonds and responsibilities to feudal Japan tie her there until they are ultimately resolved.
For clarity, below is an illustrative example where isekai is applied to a non-fictional, non-parallel, non-virtual world.

* The main characters are from Earth. One day, they are abducted by Nazis from Mars (alternate "world") are brought back to their Martian base. The main characters are trapped on Mars. Their only escape is to defeat the Nazis and steal their spaceship to return to Earth (specific goal required to escape); they are left to thier own devices, with no prospect of help from Earth, and no way to contact Earth.
