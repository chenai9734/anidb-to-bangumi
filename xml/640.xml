<description>Usually, the birth of heirs would be a joy to any kingdom. But at the time of the birth of the royal twins, it was prophesied that if the girl child reaches her 16th birthday, she would be the cause of the destruction of the world. Out of fear of the prophecy, it was decided that she should not be allowed to live and the little child was cast off the highest cliff to a certain death.
http://anidb.net/ch3978 [Pacifica], the child of whom the prophecy spoke, is now 15 years old and travelling with her adoptive brother http://anidb.net/ch3979 [Shannon] and sister http://anidb.net/ch3980 [Raquel] who are dedicated to protect her. Chased by various forces dedicated to see that the sentence of death is carried out, Pacifica is compelled to hide her identity and to rely on the strength of her brother`s sword and the mastery of her sister`s sorcery to stay alive.
With an army of warriors, sorcerers, and the might of the church all dedicated to her death, will the assistance of brother and sister be enough, or will Pacifica have to call forth the power to save herself and fulfil her destiny as it was told in the prophecy?</description>

<name>artificial intelligence</name>
<description>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science that aims to create it. AI textbooks define the field as "the study and design of intelligent agents" where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success. John McCarthy, who coined the term in 1956, defines it as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines."
The field was founded on the claim that a central property of humans, intelligence—the sapience of Homo sapiens—can be so precisely described that it can be simulated by a machine. This raises philosophical issues about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings, issues which have been addressed by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity. Artificial intelligence has been the subject of optimism, but has also suffered setbacks and, today, has become an essential part of the technology industry, providing the heavy lifting for many of the most difficult problems in computer science.
AI research is highly technical and specialized, and deeply divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other. Subfields have grown up around particular institutions, the work of individual researchers, the solution of specific problems, longstanding differences of opinion about how AI should be done and the application of widely differing tools. The central problems of AI include such traits as reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, communication, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence (or "strong AI") is still among the field`s long term goals.</description>

<name>zettai ryouiki</name>
<description>"Absolute Territory" (絶対領域, Zettai Ryouiki in Japanese) describes the area of uncovered thigh between the skirt and the knee sock.
As per usual for fandom who obsess about costumes, this can be considered a moe attribute and thus, present prominently in character designs and schoolgirl outfits. The term originates from http://anidb.net/a22 [Neon Genesis Evangelion] to designate an area of Absolute Terror, although it`s had considerable semantic drift. In this case, it may jokingly refer to the fact it emphasizes a shorter skirt without actually becoming creepy and showing the underpants.
As if that wasn`t enough, some even categorize it into five "Grades", from E to A. Only the top two (A and B) are considered true Zettai Ryouiki and they are only usable by female characters. Some researchers additionally introduce Grade S, the highest one which consists of Grade A plus further requirements to personality and hairstyle.
Just to make it clear, Zettai Ryouiki is made up of three components: socks, skin, and skirt. An Action Girl may trade the latter for hotpants but if it doesn`t include knee-highs and thighs, it`s not Zettai Ryouiki. Panty Shot is an entirely different zone.

<name>swimsuit</name>
<description>A swimsuit is one of several kinds of garments designed to be worn by people engaging in water-based activities or sports or during certain activities under sunlight. Most kinds of swimsuit reveal a large portion of the body surface area, but exceptions exist. The more revealing kinds may also be worn as undergarment in sports that require wetsuits, or when there is a need to display the body, as in the case of beauty pageants or bodybuilding contests.
There is a very wide range of styles of modern swimsuits, which vary in relation to body coverage and materials. The choice of style of swimsuit is dependent on current fashions, community standards of modesty, and plain personal preference. Swimsuits for men usually expose the chest, while those for women do not usually do so; however, many women prefer to engage in water or sun activities with their torso uncovered, in a practice commonly described as toplessness or topfreedom. Since the early twentieth century a naturist movement has developed in western countries that seeks a return to non-sexual nakedness when swimming and during other appropriate activities; in some places around the world, nude beaches have been set aside for people who choose to engage in normal beach activities in the nude, and such beaches may or may not enforce nudity onto their goers.
In anime, it is common for at least one episode to feature the characters in swimsuits, usually as an excuse for gratuitous fanservice; when that happens, the episode is usually labeled a pool or beach episode, after the place the characters went to. Swimsuits, and in particular one-piece swimsuits, are a very common fetish in Japan; while the reason for that is uncertain, a common folk explanation is the fact that boys throughout their entire adolescence are commonly exposed to their female classmates wearing them, in what might be called an experiment in sexual discovery waiting to happen.</description>

<name>amnesia</name>
<description>The character suffers from some kind of amnesia (memory disturbance or loss). This may mean inability to memorize new information, or inability to recollect old memories. Since there are many types of memory, the person may e.g. forget who they are but still retain learned skills.
Amnesia is fairly common in fiction as a plot device. In fact, because it allows for major plot changes while requiring little creativity from the author, it may be subject to heavy overuse.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>large breasts</name>
<description>Large breasts are breasts a fair notch larger than average, as found in some adolescent girls or fully grown women; however, as anime has no upper limit to breast size, the definition applies somewhat differently. To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>

<name>magic circles</name>
<description>A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised.
Traditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for non-magical work such as meditation.
Generally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<name>post-apocalyptic</name>
<description>An anime that takes place on future Earth (or it could be an alternative universe) after a major cataclysm has occurred. World War III, an alien invasion, plague, global warming or some other general disaster are common themes to build a post-apocalyptic world upon, where the effects were severe enough that mankind barely survived.
The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologised). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in an agrarian, non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of technology remain. There is a considerable degree of blurring between post-apocalyptic fiction and that which deals with false utopias or dystopian societies.</description>

<description>The Scrapped Princess. Originally thrown over a cliff when she was just a baby, she survived and was adopted by the Casull family as their youngest child. With her blonde hair and blue eyes, she is the spitting image of her mother, and her sweet nature does not seem to suggest any ill things about her. Pacifica is young and innocent despite all that is going on around her, but she questions how so much suffering can occur due to her existence and blames herself for it. She is prophesized to be the poison that destroys the world when she turns 16 years of age.
Because of this so called prophecy, shortly before she turns 16 Pacifica is stabbed and killed by her twin brother Prince Forsyth at the end of the show. On the day of her 16th birthday, her power to destroy Providence would have reached its zenith, and the spell within her would activate. After her death, Pacifica then finds herself confronting Celia Mauser, whom she is a physical recreation of, in a virtual world. While she was killed just before her 16th birthday, the power she had gained in the time she was alive was enough so that the destruction of Providence was still possible, with the addition of Pacifica`s own will. After learning why Providence was created, Celia gives Pacifica the choice to determine humanity`s future. Even though Pacifica is sympathetic to having a protected, `ideal` world to live in, she chooses instead to let humans make their own choices, and as a result of this decision, Celia disappears and Providence is destroyed, freeing mankind once and for all. After everything is over and done with and the world is finally safe, Pacifica returns to her family farm with Shannon, Raquel, and Zefiris.</description>

Later in the series, he merges with Zefiris to become a D-Knight. Strangely, he looks almost exactly like Zefiris` old master, Lord Beckham Mauser. In the end, Shannon manages to unlock the full power of the D-Knight and helps to retrieve Pacifica after her death, bringing her back to Earth. He later returns to his family farm with Pacifica, Raquel, and Zefiris.</description>

<name>Raquel Casull</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The oldest member of the Casull children. She is a powerful magic-user and able to cast spells faster than many others. She has assumed a motherly role in the family and always maintain a calm, kind attitude. She is Shannon`s sister and Pacifica`s foster sister. Like Shannon, she has a striking resemblance to Celia and Beckenham Mauser`s sister due to the genetic engineering used in their birth. It is however noted that she is often left the odd one out because of Shannon and Pacifica`s close relationship. She doesn`t seem to mind, but she is considerably less close to either of her younger siblings as they are to each other. But in some episodes it can be seen that she is actually concerned about Pacifica, for example when they went to the cave of bugs to look for plants for Pacifica`s antidote, she actually says that she didn`t mind the risks because her sister`s life was in danger. Raquel often encourages Shannon`s close relationship with Pacifica by sending her brother out to look for and comfort Pacifica. She`s quite the type of comforting Pacifica by doing something not by telling it. And despite her kind, calm and sometimes goofy nature, she will not hesitate to strike down anyone in her way of protecting Pacifica or Shannon. Raquel`s normal kindness often serves as a cover for a more aggressive and tactical mind that asserts itself whenever Pacifica or Shannon are in danger. As the oldest, Raquel prepaired her father, Yuhma, for death and lit the pyre.</description>

<name>Zefiris</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Zefiris is a Dragoon or powerful spiritual being, who has been watching the going-ons in this world for 5000 years, originally constructed to battle an alien race that attacked humans, but was used as a last resort plan to protect the Providence Breaker from the Peacemakers. Solemn, calm and quiet, Zefiris first appears as a mysterious character who seems to show up whenever the Casulls are in trouble, and often gives them hints that help them. Zefiris appears to have a very calm demeanour, and she first appears to be something like a cosmos guardian (Peacemaker), due to her strange abilities and unfazed demeanour, which is typical for the Peacemakers. She is one of the few remaining Dragoons since the Genesis War. She merges with Shannon, allowing him to become a D-Knight (D for Dragon or Dragoon) and to combat the Peacemakers. Shannon bares a significant resemblance to her true master that died in order to allow for Zefiris to live. While not quite a cold hearted as Natalie, Zefiris considered her mission to protect the Providence Breaker above all other things, including the lives of thousands of other humans. In the last episode Zefiris returns with the Casulls to their family farm to live out her days with her new master.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A fellow Dragoon who knows Zefiris, and took part in the Genesis Wars but, unlike Zefiris, lost most of her powers. To survive, she inhabits an ancient battle-vehicle, the Skid, as part of her body. Due to Natalie`s integration with the Skid, she is able to both help or hinder the people on board. In order to continue to survive, Natalie has continued to upgrade her systems, but her abilities are limited and incomplete. Her personality is also cold and unfeeling, like the Peacemakers. Natalie does not consider herself a Dragoon anymore, even though, technically, she is still a Dragoon. Once, when Zefiris remarked that her methods were too forceful; the Dragoons were in the sealed world of Providence to be the Providence Breaker`s Guardians against the Peacemakers, and to help humans. Natalie replied - in a rather unconcerned manner - (I am no longer a Dragoon. But we Dragoons need not go out of our way to help those foolish humans). Hinting that the humans, were a class below them (the Peacemakers and the Dragoons). Later in the series, as Natalie is unable to fight as a Dragoon, she helps create Dragoon emulations, the Gigas who are like the Dragoons and Peacemakers, except they do not have a humanoid form. Natalie no longer considers herself a Dragoon due to her failure to protect her master.</description>

She first appeared as a giant frog with numerous cracks on her body (using frog DNA to give herself physical form). She chased a terrified Pacifica around the lake until Zefiris dispersed her physical form, revealing a semi-transparent girl that was her humanoid form. After Pacifica followed Zefiris` request to tell Gloria to rest, Gloria thanked her and disappeared for good.</description>

<name>Suin</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A young girl whom Shannon finds outside a town. She claims to have no parents, and said she was waiting for somebody, though she did not know who it was. She follows Shannon home. After a few strange occurrences involving her, Zefiris informs Pacifica that Suin is a Peacemaker in a compressed state (the human girl form) and, on top of that, an artillery type that can cancel out the Dragoons` presence. As if to prove this, as soon as Zefiris says that, Pacifica sees Zefiris disappearing, just as Suin walks into the room. Suin was compressed because artillery types were powerful and dangerous, so to keep them in a more stable condition, Cz was compressed as Suin. Galil, it turns out, was supposed to pick Suin up at the bridge and release her true form, but was eliminated by Zefiris before he could. Steyr went in his place to seek Suin out, finding her with Pacifica and finally "unzipping" her compressed form, causing her to revert back to Cz, the Peacemaker. There was in fact, some foreshadowing about Suin`s true identity. In episode 8, when Shannon said that she might be killed if she stayed with them, she replied "I don`t die." (which is in in fact true as Peacemakers are immortal). Also, she mentioned that she had no parents when Raquel inquired about it, not that they did or she got lost, but that she simply didn`t have parents. In addition, when Pacifica tried to catch up with her in the woods, Pacifica was nearly out of breath while she was not even panting.</description>

<name>Cz</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A Peacemaker or human-shaped weapon programmed to destroy the Scrapped Princess. She wore one of a pair of earring charms which Pacifica gave her when she was Cin/Suin, which she continues to wear even after reverting back to her Peacemaker form. Later in the show, possibly because of her time as Cin/Suin, Cz`s mentality is affected and she begins to sympathize with the humans, and later shows some reluctance to go on a mass killing spree. This seems to develop largely from her assignment to follow Shannon (in case he should find Pacifica), as she learns of his motivations and philosophy even while stating she doesn`t care about them. (Note also in Episode 18, the two share an umbrella in a scene that mirrors Shannon/Suin`s first meeting). Cz is an artillery type cosmos guardian. She appears to look like an attractive woman with long dark hair, but wears an outfit that looks rather different from the humans and is similar to what Steyr wears. Destroyed in last episode when she purposely drops her defenses taking a shot in the head from D-Knight Shannon.</description>

<name>Celia Mauser</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Seria is actually the Lord Mauser. 5000 years ago, she was a seer in the Genesis Wars, and could read the enemies` movements with great accuracy. With the combined powers of the Peacemakers (also known as the Valkyrie Type) and the Dragoons, humans were a formidable foe. However, Seria betrayed the humans to save her brother (A D-knight like Shannon, who also used Zefiris as his Dragoon) and sister. This led to the Peacemakers getting brainwashed, and humanity being sealed in the world called Providence. Celia had maintained her appearance from 5000 years ago to the present date in an artificial body. The Peacemakers obey her, and they do not know that she is actually a human woman. It is quite ironic, as the Peacemakers, (except for Cz) hate humans with a passion (this was only after they got brainwashed, and began to see the humans as foolish beings who just cause trouble). Seria looks exactly like Pacifica, except for lighter hair and a more matured look. Her siblings also look like Shannon and Raquel (except that Celia is their older sister, instead of younger). This is explained while Pacifica and her siblings are aboard the Skiv, and Senes explains that genetic engineering was used to ensure that Pacifica received the Providence Breaker gene, and Raquel and Shannon received Guardian genes. At the end, when Celia asks Pacifica whether it was right for the humans to be sealed, Pacifica said that people should be set free. Celia then smiles, and before disappearing in the end, says that she is glad that she is finally free to join her dead siblings.
There is a notable resemblance between Pacifica and Celia. One theory is that Browning had intentionally used Celia`s DNA as the DNA for the Providence Breaker, and that would explain why the Peacemakers cannot attack her, as Celia and Pacifica are practically the same person.</description>

<description>"Beast" Princess of the Giat Empire, she is quite short-tempered, due to her harsh childhood, where people feared her, and she and Pacifica often argued after they met. She is a warrior princess skilled with her sword and magic, and manages to revive the giant floating fortress Skid used 5000 years ago in the Genesis Wars, with the help of the Dragoon, Natalie. Even though Senes is a skilled fighter and magic user, she is still just a little below Shannon`s fighting ability and cannot beat him even if she uses her magic and swordsmanship together. This was proven in a fight between her and Shannon. It should be noted that she lasted longer against Shannon than Chris did and that Shannon was one of her few defeats. After the fight, Senes gained some respect for Shannon as a fighter and Raquel as a mage and tactician. Along with two followers, Ruce and Drake, she fights using Gigas, a dragon-like being that is somewhat similar to a Dragoon, but cannot take the form of a person. Another follower, Eirote, seems to be her second in command. She is in charge of most technical work, such as rebuilding the Gigas and maintaining the Skid. Eirote is much kinder and more soft-hearted then Senes and often soothes the Beast Princess`s rough temper for others as well as occasionally keeping Senes in line.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The Crown Prince and biological twin brother of Pacifica. Unlike his father the King, he has his people`s welfare as top priority, and despises all this unnecessary bloodshed meted to take out the Scrapped Princess. For this reason - the other being his physical resemblance to his mother and Pacifica - he is constantly at conflict with the King. When Baroness Bailaha introduced Christopher Armalite to him as her adopted son, the two became close friends. Despite his polite nature and appearance, the Prince is highly observant and quickly figures out that Chris is more than he appears. Prince Forsythe was often at dilemma over the choices he might have to make between Pacifica - the younger sister he has never known - and his people. This leads him to continually look for information on his sister to try and make an accurate decision. He refuses to allow Chris to call him by any royal title. The Mauser Cardinal asks Forsis to be an Envoy of God and think about the greater good of his people. Later, Forsis arranges a meeting with Pacifica, to finally meet his twin. After a short and awkward conversation he embraces her and apologizes, then draws his sword and stabs her in the back. He then pulls the sword free and drives it into his own chest, to atone for killing his sister by dying with her. He is revived from death when Pacifica `destroys` Providence. A comment by Chris at the end of the last episode reveals that Forsis will soon be crowned the new King.</description>
