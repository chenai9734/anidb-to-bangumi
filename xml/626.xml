<description>The military, also known as the armed forces, are forces authorized and legally entitled to use deadly force so as to support the interests of the state and its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its citizens and the prosecution of war against foreign powers. The military may also have additional functions within a society, including construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding critical areas.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>war</name>
<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<name>important haircut</name>
<description>When a character cuts off his or her hair, it often symbolizes a rite of passage or bout of character growth. A princess striking out on an adventure, or a new recruit at boot camp, for instance. Hair is something that takes time and effort to grow, so parting with it voluntarily can be a powerful act.
This is particularly a big deal when women get haircuts. Yet in fiction, even an accidental hair slicing can leave a character with a surprisingly even cut.
In many religions (Western Christianity, Ancient Egyptian religion, and others) priests and/or monks cut/shave their hair. Roman Catholic nuns also tend to cut and mantain their hair short under their veils when they enter the nunneries. The cutting of one`s own hair is also a part of Buddhist mythology, specifically something done by Siddhartha himself early on in his path to enlightenment, so anime examples might draw from this as an allusion. There are also some cultures, including Native American and many Asians, where a person would cut his or her hair as an act of grief, disgrace, or even rebellion. In the Confucian tradition, hair (like the rest of your body) is considered a gift from your parents and may not be damaged without a very good reason. Furthermore, prisoners and psychiatric patients commonly have their heads shaved, often to prevent the spread of lice, but sometimes also as a demeaning measure.

The main feature of the franchise is having a story that crosses over several popular mecha anime, manga and video games, allowing characters and mecha from different titles to team up or battle one another. Due to the nature of crossover games and licensing involved, only a few games have been released outside Japan, and in English; early English-language games only feature Banpresto`s original characters and mecha, and a flagship installment were to never be released until 2016, with the English release of Super Robot Wars V in Southeast Asian countries.

<name>F91 Gundam F91</name>
<gender>none/does not apply</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>This prototype machine, created by the military research institute SNRI, is the latest product of the Federation Forces` miniaturized mobile suit development program. The F91`s capabilities exceed those of any contemporary mobile suit, but its full potential can only be expressed with a Newtype pilot at the controls. In its high-performance mode, the F91`s face mask opens to help cool the bio-computer installed in its head, ventilator fins are deployed from its shoulders, and it can dissipate excess heat via the Metal Peel-off Effect. Thanks to its high generator output the F91 can drive multiple beam weapons, including a beam rifle, a beam shield, and a pair of powerful Variable-Speed Beam Rifle (VSBR) units.
Another new technology incorporated in the Gundam F91 was the bio-computer system developed by Doctor Monica Arno. This system acted as a sort of "reversed" psycommu system, relaying information directly to the pilot`s mind rather than vice versa. The bio-computer, however, could be used by normal pilots, and it gave the pilot many advantages by directly providing him with tactical and sensor data, piloting suggestions, and so on. Thus, the bio-computer allowed the pilot to react more quickly and decisively to any battle situation, and it also made a novice pilot`s job easier in terms of adapting to the new mobile suit.
The F91 prototype, originally manufactured by SNRI in UC 0116, was slowly upgraded and modified over the next several years. Its final assembly, which incorporated the bio-computer system, was cut short when the Crossbone Vanguard force began conquering the Frontier Side area in March UC 0123. The F91`s parts were stowed aboard the Federation Forces` training ship Space Ark, and during an escape to the Frontier I colony, the Space Ark crew rescued a group of civilian students who were also fleeing. Since the ship`s complement was made up of trainees - and a skeleton crew, at that - a pilot was needed to pilot the F91 when it was completed. Seabook Arno, one of the rescued civilians, was selected for the job, based on his rather shaky credentials of being an engineering student and the son of bio-computer engineer Doctor Arno. Although reluctant to become a soldier, Seabook soon found himself performing his duties well, adapting to the F91 easily and scoring three enemy MS kills on his first sortie.
The Gundam F91 would perform superbly during the conflict, and its abilities would soon have another surprise in store for Seabook. Being a very high-performance unit, the F91`s weapons and systems generated a tremendous amount of heat. This heat was normally dissipated through a seat of radiator fins built into the mobile suit`s shoulders; however, excessive amounts of heat would sometimes still remain throughout the mobile suit`s body. Another method of getting rid of this heat was by "shedding" the heated outermost layer of the Gundam`s armour; this had the rather dramatic effect of creating "after-images" of the mobile suit while it was moving. While confronting Crossbone Vanguard leader Carozzo Ronah`s deadly XMA-01 Rafflesia mobile armor, Seabook would find this ability useful in tricking his enemy into attacking targets that were not where they appeared to be.</description>

The Rafflesia resembles a giant flower, whose main body houses a battery of powerful beam cannons capable of destroying an Earth Federation battleship with one salvo, and whose five petals contain dozens of tentacular rods for grappling enemy mobile suits. The mobile armour is also equipped with an I-field generator whose barrier deflects all enemy beam weapons. Iron Mask controls the Rafflesia via mental commands, which are relayed through optical fibers connected to his distinctive helmet.
The Rafflesia, being Carozzo`s personal unit, was controlled by his brainwaves via a "neo-psycommu" system - an advancement on the classic psycommu technology. This system, which was composed of receptors in Iron Mask`s helmet connected to the mobile armour via a great number of fiber optic cables, allowed Carozzo to completely control all aspects of his machine without the use of manual controls.
Stored aboard the flagship Zamouth Gar, the Rafflesia was only deployed once near the end of the initial conflicts during the Crossbone Vanguard invasion of March UC 0123. Carozzo took his mobile armour into battle to kill his rebellious daughter Berah Ronah, who was trying to stop his plan to kill all humans living on Earth with his Bug weapons. Though his Rafflesia would deliver serious damage to Berah`s XM-07 Vigna Ghina, the mighty mobile armour would soon fall to Seabook Arno, who used some ingenious tricks taking advantage of the http://anidb.net/ch1726 [Gundam F91`s] abilities to cause the Rafflesia to destroy itself.</description>

<description>The Vigna Ghina is a prototype command mobile suit that is assigned to Cecily Fairchild after she rejoins the Ronah family. Based on the Crossbone Vanguard`s Berga series, this new model is equipped with a set of fin nozzles which are connected directly to its generator, yielding even greater performance. With its high mobility and power output, the Vigna Ghina is the most advanced mobile suit yet developed by the Crossbone Vanguard.
When Cecily defects to the Earth Federation Forces during the Crossbone Vanguard invasion of UC 0123, her Vigna Ghina is also given a powerful beam launcher similar to that used by the http://anidb.net/ch1726 [Gundam F91], capable of delivering a wider and more damaging beam blast than a standard beam rifle. Berah`s Vigna Ghina was destroyed in a battle against the mobile armor http://anidb.net/ch1728 [XMA-01 Rafflesia], piloted by her father, Carozzo Ronah.</description>

<description>This command mobile suit is used by leaders of Crossbone Vanguard reconnaissance teams. The Dahgi Iris is equipped with a battery of cameras and precision sensors, and its information-processing capabilities allow it to search as wide an area as five or six ordinary mobile suits. Since the energy emissions of a beam shield might interfere with its delicate sensors and electronics, the Dahgi Iris carries a traditional shield, and uses its surplus energy to generate additional thrust.
One Dahgi Iris unit was piloted by Annamarie Bourget, who later defected to the Earth Federation Forces during the Crossbone Vanguard invasion of UC 0123. Annamarie`s Dahgi Iris was then repainted into an off-yellow color to more easily distinguish it from its loyal Crossbone counterparts.</description>
