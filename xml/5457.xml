<description>Life has returned to some form of normalcy after the end of the series, and so His Majesty http://anidb.net/ch18102 [Shibuya Yuuri] travels to oversee how things are going. While doing so, he runs into the king of Small Shimeron - http://anidb.net/ch20337 [Sararegi]. But it seems there may be something more to him than the friendly king he presents himself as.
Yuuri go back to Shimaron to relax and meet some friends, when the king of Little Shimaron suddenly joins the group and wants the Maou to come to his country. The Original king sends a message to Yuuri`s brother and his friend that Yuuri is in trouble.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>novel</name>
<description>A novel is a relatively long work of narrative fiction, normally written in prose form, and which is typically published as a book. Manga, comics, or visual novels do not fit this description and are not considered novels; including a small number of illustrations, however, is still permissible, which means that light novels are considered novels.</description>

<name>parallel world</name>
<description>A parallel world, parallel universe, or alternative reality is a self-contained separate reality coexisting with our own. Because "alternative reality" sometimes implies that the reality is a variant of our own, like for example a mirror world, we use the term "parallel world/universe" which is more general, without any connotations implying a relationship (or lack thereof) with our own world/universe (meaning a fictional world can just as well have an alternative reality, it doesn`t need to be our reality). To put it more simply, this category is to show if more than 1 world/universe/reality is present in the anime.
Multiple timelines of the same world/universe/reality are NOT considered parallel worlds. For example, in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate] the cast travels through multiple "World Lines", which are defined as parallel timelines of the same universe had various events occurred with differing outcomes.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>A teacher and swordsman who adores Yuuri. Günter is a skilled swordsman and magician, but has retired to teach Yuuri about Shin Makoku and his future duties as the Maou. Günter once stated that he was the one who taught Conrad to "become His Majesty`s sword and shield" indicating that perhaps Günter was once Conrad`s teacher. When Günter accidentally travels to Earth, he becomes a model in New York City for a brief period of time so that he can earn money to find Yuuri. He is a very whimsical person and poetic in his thoughts. Günter is another test subject of Anissina.
Günter, along with the three brothers, helps Yuuri run the country. He is Yuuri`s adviser and mentor, teaching Yuuri various aspects of Shin Makoku. He usually spends his time doing numerous duties for Yuuri and Shin Makoku.</description>

<name>Weller Conrad</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>His given name is Conrart; Yuuri nicknames him "Conrad," which is "closer to English" and easier to pronounce with a Japanese tongue. Conrad is the second child of the previous Maoh, Cecilie von Spitzweig. His father was human (also considered the greatest swordsman in the Demon Kingdom; Dan Hiri Weller). His ancestor, Lawrence Weller, fought alongside the Original King during the war against Soushu. On his 16th birthday, he decided to live as a Mazoku instead of a human. He fought on the front lines for the Mazoku during a war against the humans. He and Yozak are the only two survivors of the Battle of Lütenburg. He was also put in charge of the soul at the request of Suzanna Julia von Wincott, that was to be the new Maou, and brought it safely to Earth so that it could be born.
Furthermore, he was the one who was the inspiration for Yuuri`s name. He stated that "Where I come from, the month of July is called Yuuri", which made Yuuri`s mother name him Yuuri because he was born in July. For this reason, Yuuri dubs him `Nazukeoya`, which is a person who names someone (Conrad is also known as Yuuri`s Godfather by his mother). Cecilie named the blue flowers she grew "Conrad Stands Upon Earth".</description>

<name>von Voltaire Gwendal</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The eldest son of Cecilie. From the beginning, Gwendal has objections to Yuuri becoming the Maou. He is a skilled tactician and is capable of using earth magic and can cast barriers. When not otherwise busy, Gwendal indulges in his hobby of knitting and sewing but often his creatures look nothing like what they`re supposed to (for example a bear got mistaken for a black pig or a cat that looks like a raccoon). He is adamnant that knitting helps him sharpen his concentration but actually its a stress reliever for him since childhood. He is also quite fond of cute animals or cute objects such as the dolphin keychain (Bandou-kun) Yuuri received at the dolphin show and later gave to him. His childhood best friend is Anissina von Karbelnikoff, an inventor who often tests out her inventions on him, much to his displeasure. Anissina is also the one who taught Gwendal how to knit.
Gwendal is a tough guy except when it comes to his childhood friend, Anissina, and his brothers. He is afraid of Anissina and often hides from her so he can prevent being used in one of her crazy experiments. He is even seen sweating in panic at the thought of her. While he does not outwardly show much affection towards his brothers, he shows in times of great stress that he does care, an example being his decision to stand against the Original King to save his little brother, Wolfram. Jozak, who was sent to locate one of the Four Forbidden Boxes, tells Conrad that Gwendal really cares for Conrad`s wellbeing and doesn`t want Conrad to worry despite the Original King`s wishes for Conrad to find the Boxes. His ancestor, Siegbert Voltaire, fought along the Original King.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A young man who finds himself engaged to Yuuri after a mistake. He is a `bishounen`, which means a pretty or beautiful boy. He is very feminine looking, with a beautiful face, shoulder-length blond hair and long eyelashes. His appearance is so influential, that several dying people in the hospital have a miraculous recovery after laying eyes on him. Wolfram possesses fire magic, as well as being adept with a sword. He is the half-brother of Conrad and Gwendal. He has extremely high pride and is hot-headed. He is arrogant and short-tempered but can also be quite compassionate at times. He is called "little lord brat." He is the only one of the previous queen`s three sons who inherited her emerald green eyes and blonde hair, bearing a striking resemblance to her. It seems he inherited fire magic and selfishness from his fathers side. Wolfram is obsessed with Yuuri and insists on following him everywhere as he claims it is his duty to protect his fiancé, though he also seems to want to prevent him from cheating on him. His ancestor, Rufus Bielefeld, fought alongside the Original King.</description>

<description>Born in Hong Kong and raised in Japan. Murata Ken met Yuuri in middle school, where they were in the same class for two years. He now goes to a famous private school. His name is similar to Yuuri`s favorite historical drama actor Matsudaira Ken, so he is the only one of Yuuri`s former classmates that he remembers the name and face of other than baseball club members. Ken is known to smile often and keep relatively quiet. He often tells jokes which don`t suit his age which makes Yuuri ask "how old are you really?".
Dr. Rodriguez was responsible for handling his soul, around the same time when Conrad transported Julia`s soul.
He is the reincarnation of the Great Sage. The double black tactician and strategist to the Original King of Shin Makoku. He remembers parts of the past lives he has had over the past 4000 years. Other people in the story don`t seem to remember any of their past lives, so his remembering some seems to be very special. Because of his past lives he is able to speak Shin Makoku`s language, English and French. His parents are always busy with work so he is home alone a lot. He also spends a lot of time with Yuuri`s family.</description>

<description>The previous Maou and mother of Wolfram, Conrad and Gwendal, each with different fathers. Although initially, Cecilie seems to be rather airheaded, she is actually very astute and intelligent and a very caring person. Having been replaced as the Maou by Yuuri, Cecilie takes advantage of her open schedule to hunt for men on her "free and easy quest for love." She has displayed interest in Yuuri (though she remains one of the chief supporters in his engagement to her son, Wolfram), his older brother Shouri, and even her childhood friend Raven. At one time, she wanted to marry him, much to her brother`s chagrin. Cecilie is also quite powerful, and has admirable skill with the whip. When fighting, she has the uncanny ability to quickly dress in red leather and mask. This form and her skill tends to scare her enemies, and if they ever meet her the second time, they are usually unwilling to fight her again.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Anissina is an inventor and is also Gwendal`s childhood friend. She often uses him to test out her inventions and it is for this reason that Gwendal seems to fear Anissina. When Gwendal is not around, Günter becomes her test subject. She is also the one who taught Gwendal, and later Greta, how to knit.
If the men are away from the castle, it is usually Anissina who takes control. When she does so, her inventions are usually seen everywhere. The names of her inventions often end in `kun`, and usually state what they are supposed to do. Her inventions often require the use of maryoku (a kind of magic) and they actually do more harm than good.
Aside from her inventions, she spends her time writing adventure story books involving herself as a super-heroine figure. These also usually keep Greta entertained, though Yuuri and Wolfram often doubt whether they are even appropriate for children.</description>

She succeeds Ondine, whose final assignment after retirement was to get Yuuri to form a pact with the elements. Ulrike is the one who, at the order of and with additional powers from the Original King, transports Yuuri to and from his world to Shin Makoku. Just like all other priestesses, she is not permitted to leave the Original King`s castle. Yuri however, once tried to take her out to show her the beautiful world outside, but Wolfram barged in thinking he was flirting with her.
At one point in the anime, her "childhood spirit" escaped from her body and went outside to play. Her skills frightened the other children and caused chaos in the village. Ulrike chased after her younger form, and revealed her ability to take on the form of a young woman (as opposed to her current child-like one) to "comfort" her younger self.</description>

<description>He originally doubted Yuuri, but Yuuri eventually gaines his trust by entrusting him with Morgif`s Jewel. This is Morgif`s source of power, and Yozak later returns it so Morgif can help Yuuri defend a human village from a stolen Holy Sword and its not-quite-human wielder.
He goes back a long way with Conrad: they`ve known each other since they were children. Yozak and Conrad are the only survivors of the Lütenburg army, a portion of the army of Shin Makoku that fought in the past war with the humans for the mazoku. The Lütenburg warriors were all half-human half-mazoku fighters that wished to prove their loyalty to Shin Makoku. Halfbloods were - and are - looked down upon by both mazoku and humans because of the hatred between the races.
It can only be assumed that as relations between the species change, so will the treatment of halfbreeds. Yuuri`s efforts to unite humans and mazoku are one of the main reasons Yosak supports Yuuri. He is the first one to find out that Murata Ken is the person with the soul of the Great Sage, the Original King`s trusted friend.</description>

Her mother, the Queen of Zoracca, sent her to be raised by her uncle, the King of Svelera, before the kingdom fell. At first Greta tried to kill Yuuri by posing as his illegitimate daughter because her uncaring foster parents hated the Maou and she believed she could earn their love by assassinating him. Not much later Yuuri forgives and adopts her. Wolfram follows suit, reasoning that as Yuuri`s fiancé he is also Greta`s parent.</description>

<description>Shibuya Miko, also known as Jennifer of Yokohama is Yuuri and Shouri`s human mother. She has known about Yuuri becoming Maou since before Yuuri was born but did not tell him. She is very energetic, loves fantasy and has a big imagination. Miko had always wanted to have a baby girl, so when Yuuri was young she let his hair grow long and dressed him in girls` clothes. Through the series little is learned about her, but she is known to be an excellent fencer, always ready and willing to defend her family.
Miko often gives strange advice to Yuuri, and in some situations it really helps Yuuri out. She likes to be called "Mama" instead of "Mom" or "Mother" by her sons, and "Jennifer" by other people. The only ones who actually call her "Mama" are not her sons, but Murata and Wolfram.
Her specialty is curry, which she says can unite the world in peace.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Yuuri`s older brother who is apparently a genius, likes to play dating simulators and is very protective of Yuuri. He is to become Bob`s successor as the Maou of Earth. When he was younger, he met Bob who rescued Yuuri and him from some bullies. While initially despising his parents for having a divorcement argument, he also resented the fact that Yuuri will have to go to Shin Makoku eventually. Bob explained to him it will happen in the future, and Shouri was contented being with Yuuri for the time being. Shouri wanted Yuuri to call him "onii-chan" but Yuuri refused to and became more independent when he went to elementary school. It is seen that Shouri communicates regularly with Bob, who he complains emphasizes his age more than anything else.
Often carrying a cold attitude, he did not welcome having Wolfram and the others in his house. He seems especially distasteful to Conrad, and makes a point of demanding that Conrad returns his clothes to him properly cleaned (since the two of them are about the same build and size, Jennifer usually lends Shouri`s clothing to Conrad). Later, he and Conrad form an understanding based on their mutual desire to protect Yuuri.
Once Shouri ends up in Shin Makoku, he becomes suspicious about the Original King, MurataKen, and the four forbidden boxes.
Shouri eventually goes to Shin Makoku where he learns to use the powerful maryoku he possesses. Wolfram gave Shouri a pact to the elements, somewhat like how Odine (Andine by some translations) gave a pact to Yuuri to gain control of his maryoku. Shouri`s maryoku is like of Yuuri`s, the control of water, but initially Shouri`s maryoku takes the form of a giant hand. He is, however, seen to be able to shape his maryoku into water dragons after some training with Ulrike, who comments that Shouri is extraordinary because he learned to control his maryoku slightly in a short span of time.</description>

Shouma was originally angered by Conrad`s cold attitude, and told him to never let his son or wife see that unsmiling face. Conrad takes those words to heart, and later grows to become the `smiling godfather` Yuuri often sees. Shouma is much more soft-spoken than his wife, and a fan of the Boston Red Sox.</description>

<description>The Great One (known as the Shin`ou) is the first King of Shin Makoku. His soul watches over the lands of Shin Makoku, and priestess such as Ulrike and Ondine can communicate with him in a limited fashion, one they call "hearing His Majesty`s voice". Murata also appears to be able to communicate with him, and is often seen scolding him for meddling in Shin Makoku`s affairs.
4000 years ago, the Great One sealed the Soushu into four boxes, which became known as the "Four Forbidden Boxes". However, while part of the Soushu was sealed in the boxes, a small part of the Soushu infected the Great One to the extent where his right arm seemed slightly decayed. The Great One knew that the Soushu would eventually take over his mind and body completely, so the Great One came up with a plan along with his Great Sage to completely eradicate the Soushu in the future. This involved sealing the Soushu with a pure soul, and destroying it. This soul turned out to be the Great One, but Yuuri manages to eradicate the Soushu without harming the Great One, earning Yuuri the title of the greatest Maou. The Original King commented that he was glad he chose Yuuri as the Maou.</description>

<description>Years ago, Hube`s bigotry and ambition led to many deaths forcing Gwendal, his cousin, to banish Hube from the Demon Kingdom to search for a lost artifact, the Great Demon Flute. Twenty years later, Yuuri discovers Hube in Conansia Svelera (Suberera) from the human woman, Nicola, who is bearing Hube`s child. Yuuri struggles to learn details about Hube`s past but no one wants to talk about the acts that were so terrible, even Conrad is content to watch him die. Hube becomes the bodyguard for a corrupt lord who swindles people into gambling and taking their shop deeds. When Yuuri eventually discovers the truth, he forgave Hube for unintentionally trying to kill him, and begs Gwendel not to kill Hube. Gwendal eventually agrees not to, and Hube leaves for his own castle, but not before he tells Gwendal about a box he saw in Suberera. The incident left Hube without his left eye, indicating this box was one of the Four Forbidden Boxes.
Hube swore loyalty to Yuuri because Yuuri chose spare his life despite Hube`s crime. As such, Hube would go to extreme lengths to protect Yuuri, such as leaving Nicola to fight against the possessed Original King.</description>

<description>Lady Flynn Gilbit assumed the role of her husband Lord Norman Gilbit to protect her small country, Caloria, and its lands after his death. She chose to wear a mask and pretend to be her husband because Small Shimaron had conquered Caloria and, under their laws, women cannot inherit lands or titles, and adoptions are only valid before the death of the husband. Upon discovering that Big Shimaron has one of the Forbidden boxes ("The End of the Wind"), she assists Yuuri and his group in retrieving it.
The original rulers of Caloria were the Wincott family, and because of Flynn`s ancestors, the Wincott family was forcefully removed from rule. Due to this incident, Flynn is troubled when Julia`s father, Lord Odell von Wincott, visits Blood Pledge castle on Yuuri`s request.</description>
