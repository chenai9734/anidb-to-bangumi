<description>It is Tokyo, 1969. Earth is under the attack of the Invaders. Fortunately, though, the public is unaware of this. But to the secret organization, A.E.G.I.S., the threat is very real, and it is up them to stop this invasion. One day on his route to high school, Ukiya Shun observes a battle between a young girl and a group of Invaders. He ends up helping her and discovers that much like the girl, he possesses the ability to generate a gate of special power that only a few other people are gifted with. As a result, Ukiya then joins A.E.G.I.S. in an effort to recruit other Gate Keepers in order to protect the city, all while doing his best not to imitate his late father, whom he despises.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>A bashful crybaby in kindergarten, in fact Shun calls her `Rurippe` (pronounced "RU-RI-PE") for that. Once she cried when she broke her teacher`s vase, but Shun steps on it to take the blame instead. When Shun left was about to leave the neighborhood, she confessed her feelings for Shun. Shun denied her because she was a sniveler. Shun did sound rude but he still gave her his toy as a remembrance of their friendship.
Probably it was in first year when her power awakened. One rainy day, she encountered a dying kitten. She took it to a veterinary clinic, which was closed so she tried to do something about it until her healing power (Gate of Life) broke free and healed the kitten.
She has changed since then. In high school, she`s the richest, most intelligent and the most popular student in school and is viewed as a model student and an active participant in school activities.
She is the first recruited Gate Keeper member of the Far East Branch AEGIS, and she has received official training directly from them.</description>

<description>An only girl in the Konoe family, she lives with her father and five brothers. Her childhood dream is to be an Olympian. Her father who deeply believes in her, advised her that everything is possible if one works hard. Although she never won in tournaments, she continued working hard. Determined that she can be an Olympian, she paid no attention to those who wanted her to quit. She strives so hard that the power inside her is too much for her to handle. She broke the record of an olympian (Hayes), and others instead of being proud of her spread various rumors. She was disqualified, because her record is not acceptable. Since then, she wanted to quit school and work instead.
AEGIS discovered her and tried to recruit her. She refused their offer and she only went to the base only to test her skills. She did not believe in Invaders because they are just unrealistic stories for her. For her, unrealistic stories are only dreams.
Shun challenged her to a kendo match and if he wins, she joins. But after 21 matches, Kaoru wins and Shun is already worn out. She has not changed her decision, so she heads home. On her way home, she encountered real Invaders with her own eyes. She saved children that were almost killed by them. She realized how powerful the Invaders are. When she was not about to handle their power, Shun and Ruriko came to her rescue. When it was Shun`s turn to be crushed, Kaoru caught them and saved Shun. Shun destroyed them and praised Kaoru for what she did. It was the first time that she heard a praise for her hard work. Since then, she joined the Gate Keepers and her dreams were fulfilled, not as an Olympian but as an earth defender.</description>

That is when he started writing "Otochan no Baka!" (My Dad is an Idiot!) in his dad`s garage. His work has something to do with an engine, and he happened to finish creating it so he promised Shun that he will attend his graduation. Shun did not believe him because he always break his promises. His father insisted that he will come and he promised that they will test the engine after the graduation. Shun agreed to his promise. During their graduation ceremony, he waited for his father but he did not come. His father met a car accident on his way to the graduation ceremony. That happening left a scar in Shun`s heart because for him his father died without even keeping a word.
The death of his father caused his family to have financial problems. He worked as a newspaper boy to support his mother and sister and his schooling too. He is talented in kendo, even though he is just a beginner, he almost hit an experienced opponent. His kendo teacher offered him to join and learn from the basics, and if he does well, he may happen to receive scholarship. But he refused his offer and chose work instead of sports. One time, after doing some newspaper delivery, he met Mr. Matsuda. He helped him in fixing his car, until the Invaders pass by them. He ran after it because it was headed to where his home is. It did not destroy their house, but only a memorable place where he remembers his father carrying him. He got angry and picked up a can and threw it. He noticed that the can was thrown with power. Then he got attacked with Invaders, after he was fallen, a girl healed him and gave some power to him. He ended the Invaders with a gate power that just got out of him. He realized that the girl is his childhood friend. Since then, he joined AEGIS and became a Gate Keeper.</description>

<description>The only Gate Keeper with the Invaders.
He is not really born evil. As a child, he could control his Gate (the Gate of Darkness). His gate absorbs infinite knowledge and foresees the future as well as happiness.
His real name is Yuji Mitsuoka. He is rich, good looking, and intelligent. But with his ability, he saw what will happen to his father`s business if he agrees to risk their trust funds for a business. Yuji`s dad didn`t believe him and he slaps him for telling `nonsense`. What Yuji predicted became true, and they lost everything. Yuji`s dad died, maybe when they lost all their assets. Yuji is left alone wandering in the streets with only little amount of money that can only afford a single bread.
He visited what`s left of his house, and he saw his uncle. Yuji knows that his uncle tricked his father and planned to take away all their belongings. Yuji knows everything, and for his uncle he is ominous. His uncle kicks him like he`s nobody. Yuji felt the pain until he gets numb. He crushed bugs crawling in his way. He enrages and opens a yellow gate. He calls his uncle a speck of a bug, his gate turns black and he destroys his house.
Yuji Mitsuoka changed his name to Reiji Kageyama, a non existent shadow of his past. Invader staffs Kikai Shogun and Akuma Hakushaku discovers him and made alliance with him. They controlled him, but this Reiji in the end controls them.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>She`s the only daughter of the Asagiri household. When she was young, her parents gave her a piano as a present. She was very happy about it but it did not last when they started hating each other. They part ways and left her with Ms. Ono, her guardian. Ms. Ono has replaced Reiko`s parents. She is the one who always supervised her piano practice. Reiko, with the hopes of bringing her parents together, plays the piano. It`s a sad thing when they did not attend her first piano recital.
Every child has his/her own fantasy. Reiko always dreamed about becoming a good witch, similar to the one that granted Cinderella`s dream. Some children outgrow their childhood fantasies, but she is different. She always wanted to be helpful and useful to everyone, like the good witch. When her power awakened (the Gate of Illusion), she did not think twice in joining the Gate Keepers, because for her, her power is similar to a good witch`s magic.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>She`s originally a GateKeeper from AEGIS Shanghai Branch. She had a mission to pursuit the Invader plane and somewhat landed in Japan. After the mission she chooses to live in Japan for a while.
When she was young, the government took her grandfather and brother away from her. Being left alone probably contributed to the awakening of her power (the Gate of Red Heat).
For her age, she`s smart. As young as 12, she`s already in 1st year high school. Not only is she intelligent, but she`s also a good cook. She cooks Chinese food in her past time. She loves anything produced by nature, like fruits, vegetables and animals.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Megumi lives in a ramen restaurant. She is the second best student in Class 2-A, yet she`s dissatisfied with it. She`s jealous of Ruriko, seeing that she has everything - she`s rich, intelligent and popular. Megumi`s quite competitive, so she hates Ruriko who always excels.
Her power (the Gate of Walls/Gate of Steel) awakened when her Mr. Fukuoka, a teacher in History, became an Invader. For her, Mr. Fukuoka was the only one who understood her, because he always is in favor of her. She joins the Gate Keepers not solely because of the Fukuoka incident, but because she doesn`t want Ruriko to be any better than her.
Megumi is a loner. She always talks to herself whenever she observes something. Like Misao, she`s somewhat antisocial, but to be specific, she hates the opposite sex.</description>

Like her name Yukino suggests, she commands the Gate of Ice and Snow, being able to summon blizzards and hail. She is one of the most powerful Gate Keepers in the series, being referred to as a `top-secret, High-Level Gate Keeper.</description>

<description>The Commander of the A.E.G.I.S. Far-East Branch oversees the operations and deployments of Japan`s Gate Keepers. He was an Ensign in the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II, and was supposed to fly an Ohka piloted bomb on a suicide mission in 1945, near the end of World War II. However, his mothership was shot down, and ironically, he was the sole survivor. When he attempted to commit suicide with a pistol after being rescued by the US Navy, he was restrained by a sailor who told him two words: "Stay alive." This changed his life and after the war he was one of the first members of the Police Reserve (later the Japan Self Defense Force). In the PlayStation Gate Keepers RPG and the Gate Keepers 1985 novel, it is revealed that the Commander`s name is Tetsuya Tokiwatari (時渡 哲也, Tokiwatari Tetsuya?) and he has the Gate of Time and Space.</description>
