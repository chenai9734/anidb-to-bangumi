<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="536010">This series has a lot of contrasts.

It walks the line between very mature and very immature. And the line between run of the mill and unique.

It`s main character is also a fine example of contrasts. He deals out mature adivce but at the same time indulging in stupid antics. Supporting characters do slip into cliche roles on the surface but have elements underneath that make them unique.

Ultimately at its core, its a high school romance/drama.  The flashy powers and superpower storyline are mostly in the background rather than the focus.</recommendation>

<description>One day at the literature club, while play-pretending being possessed by some otherworldly power, http://anidb.net/ch68478 [July] actually summons superpowers onto everyone at the club: http://anidb.net/ch68477 [Chifuyu] (materializes objects), http://anidb.net/ch68480 [Tomoyo] (controls the flow of time), http://anidb.net/ch68479 [Hatoko] (manipulates the five elements), http://anidb.net/ch68481 [Sayumi] (restores original state), and July (summons a useless dark flame).
At the club they perform a monthly superpower check-up, just to be sure they can control their new powers, should the need ever arise. When the student council president, http://anidb.net/ch69389 [Mirei], suddenly appears at the club for an "inspection", July accuses her of actually "surveying" them... and that turns out to be the case, and she has the ability to steal superpowers. Further investigation reveals that Mirei received her powers only recently, whereas the club members have them for six months now. Could some mysterious outside force be turning normal students at their school into superpower-wielders?

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>medium awareness</name>
<description>Medium awareness is the situational and generally temporary awareness characters in works of fiction have and display of the very fact that they are characters in works of fiction. For example, they may comment about the background music, quip about the script or narration, complain about the roles given to them by the writer or their lack of screen time, see the subtitles that appear on screen, inform the audience about the arrival of the commercial break, and even use medium effects as tools. The most common form of medium awareness is known as breaking the fourth wall, in which characters speak directly to the audience, either to it as a whole or to specific members of it. The "fourth wall" is the imaginary "wall" at the front of the stage of a proscenium theatre through which the audience sees the play; it is a metaphor for the boundary between what happens inside the work, to the characters, and outside it, to the audience.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

The term has its roots in http://anidb.net/a185 [Top o Nerae!] — Gunbuster, Gainax`s first OVA (1988), in which the Gainax bounce is found unabated in the three female characters of Noriko, Kazumi, and Jung.</description>

<name>mundane made awesome</name>
<description>Sometimes normal just doesn`t cut it. Eating: you put food in your month and chew. Playing sports: you throw a ball around. You need to make it awesome, no matter how mundane it is.
Let`s throw in some gripping orchestral music, lighting changes, different camera angles, something! Don`t write like a man, write like an evil overlord! Exaggerate your expressions and gestures, speak with excessive intonation, and if all else fails, throw in some close-ups, slow motion, and ominous Latin chanting! With practice, even you can turn something like eating chips into an epic battle of light and dark, blinding the viewer with sheer awesomeness.

Gendo is a brilliant scientist and politician (the master of puppets in the series) who works diligently for his organization; however, he is an extremely cold and distant father towards his son, and has no qualms about using and discarding people to achieve his goals.</description>

<name>Ikari Yui</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>She was a student of genetic engineering at Kyoto University, where she met Fuyutsuki, who took an interest in her research and would later become a mentor and trusted friend, as well as her future husband Gendo. Afterwards, she joined the Artificial Evolution Laboratory (which would become Gehirn) in Hakone, Japan, and played an integral role in Project E.
Despite Fuyutsuki`s misgivings, Yui served as the test subject for the Contact Experiment of Unit 01 in 2004, saying that "everything happens as it must." She invited her son Shinji to Gehirn to watch what would be her final moments: Yui "disappeared" during testing — leaving no body behind — and was proclaimed dead that same year after efforts to recover her failed. Although Gehirn considered it an accident, it is arguably clear that what happened was Yui`s intention. Living on as the soul of the Eva, she continues to ensure a "bright future" for Shinji and the rest of humanity, seeing to it personally that Seele`s scenario is never entirely fulfilled.</description>

<name>Red Canti</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>http://anidb.net/ch10207 [Canti], when an enemy is sited, loses control of himself and turns red. In this mode he is the opposite of his normal shy and obedient self - a true fighter. In addition, though he can fight on his own, he needs a "pilot", that must literally be eaten to assume his position in the "cockpit".
Only in this form he can transform in a cannon.
There are some strong hints in the plot, that Canti is being controlled by http://anidb.net/ch10127 [Atomsk]. Actually, this state is his original, that was "cut off" by http://anidb.net/ch5487 [Haruko] when hit on the head.
Later on revealed that Cannon-form uses the pilot as the ammunition for shooting. This is a joke-reply by GAINAX to the Xenogears game by Square, which was heavily influenced by http://anidb.net/a22 [NGE] and where one of the strongest attacks was shooting the pilot as a bullet from the transformed mecha.
Possibly, only with N.O.-capable pilot Canti gains the ability to open N.O. channel to transport matter (Atomsk`s guitar and later himself).</description>

<description>Panty and Stocking`s pet sidekick, resembling a green dog with zippers for ears and a tail. He is subjected to various injuries in the series, but recovers extremely quickly. He is often used as a sort of mail box by Heaven, getting struck by lightning and spitting out a clue to a Ghost`s whereabouts. He is only able to say his own name, and has been shown to be capable of driving the Anarchy sisters` car, a roofless pink Hummer H1 called See-Through. His brain is operated by a small red devil in a black suit who can exit through the zippers on Chuck`s head. Chuck himself bears a striking resemblance to a "disguised" GIR from the series Invader Zim.</description>

<summary>The literature club have a recreation day spent playing tennis with their abilities. Later, as July goes off to search for his misplaced "Bloody Bible", the other girls reflect on how he, despite his odd behavior, has been helping them all this time. While retrieving his book, July comes across an alumni named Kiryuu Hajime, who seems to share his passion for chuunibyou naming. He is later revealed to be Tomoyo`s older half-brother who left home a year ago. The next day, honorary literature club member Himeki Chifuyu appears before July, stating she has quit elementary school.

<summary>July carried Chifuyu on his back to her school before he met up with Kuki Madoka and proceed to go to go to his own school. Later, the club use Chifuyu`s "World Create" ability to dress up in various cosplay outfits, after which Chifuyu`s aunt, teacher Satomi Shiharu, mentions that Chifuyu had left school early. Later, Chifuyu shows up at July`s house after getting into a fight with her friend, Kuki Madoka, who told her not to spend time with the Literature Club anymore. Things get worse between them due to Chifuyu being unable to tell Madoka about her powers, leading her to believe she likes them more than her. July attempts his own dubious manner of trying to get the two to make up, but Chifuyu accomplishes this on her own by having Shiharu help her win Madoka a plush to match with hers. Afterwards, Chifuyu reveals that her wanting to quit elementary school was from a desire to skip grades and enter high school alongside the other members.

<summary>The members of Senkou High School`s literature club become shocked when Andou July, a boy usually known for his chuunibyou delusions, suddenly develops superpowers of his own. Six months later, each of the club members have since developed their own superpowers, which they put to the test in their monthly check-up. When student council member Kudou Mirei comes to check on the club, she ends up misinterpreting July`s chuunibyou behavior and inadvertently reveals that she herself has developed superpowers as well. Mirei challenges the club to a superpower battle, using her own ability to steal July`s "Dark and Dark" ability, only to find it to be nothing more than a useless lukewarm flame. With the other members knowing not to show off their powers before her, they easily beat Mirei in a physical match. Learning that Mirei learned of the club`s powers from an anonymous text, the group become curious about just who sent it.

It is revealed that this "Fairy War" between superpower humans is for the entertainment of a group of fairies, with the last eight users standing being granted a wish. One of these fairies, Litia, informs Hajime`s band of ability users, Fallen Black, that an organization known as F is fighting against the war, tasking Hajime with crushing it.

<summary>After working with the Literature Club members to make a personalized video game for July`s birthday, Takanashi Sayumi, who has the power to revert things to their original state, catches a cold. July pays Sayumi a visit at her house, where he meets her younger sister Maiya, though Sayumi attitude suddenly changes when July bring up how she was the student council in middle school. The next day, after July hears from Maiya about how Sayumi had originally wanted to join the student council during high school, Mirei theorizes she may have turned it down due to her powers. This leads July to recall an incident that happened ten months ago in which Sayumi, who suggested they use her "Root of Origin" ability to remove everyone`s powers, battled against July who was against it. The result of that battle showed that Sayumi`s power could not erase July`s Dark and Dark, as their powers were meant to be accepted as part of themselves. Sayumi later explains that her change in attitude was purely due to her medication, also stating she has no regrets turning down the student council for the sake of her fellow club members.
