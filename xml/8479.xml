<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Music anime generally revolves around people concerned with music in their everyday lives. In addition they often adhere to certain genre conventions, the emphasis on training and practice in preparation for competitions, characters desire for self improvement, and pursuit of a specific goal. This is not unlike the Sports category.</description>

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Hatsune Miku is a singing synthesizer application and its female character, developed by Crypton Future Media. It uses Yamaha Corporation`s Vocaloid 2 synthesizing technology. The name of the character comes from a fusion of the Japanese for first (初 hatsu), sound (音 ne) and future (Miku (ミク) sounds like a nanori reading of future, 未来, normally read as mirai), referring to her position as the first of Crypton`s Character Vocal Series. She was the second Vocaloid to be sold using the Vocaloid 2 engine and the first Japanese Vocaloid to use the Japanese version of the Vocaloid 2 engine. Her voice is sampled from Japanese voice actress, http://anidb.net/cr1673 [Fujita Saki]. Hatsune Miku has performed onstage as a projection.
Miku`s popularity has seen various references to her in anime. During an episode of http://anidb.net/a5576 [Zoku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei], Miku is seen auditioning for the voice of http://anidb.net/ch13125 [Otonashi Meru] (Kagamine Rin and Len are referenced in the same episode). Miku`s voice is used in the last http://anidb.net/s10696 [ending theme] for the anime series http://anidb.net/a6182 [Akikan!]. In the http://anidb.net/a5932 [Lucky Star OVA], http://anidb.net/ch32 [Hiiragi Kagami] gets magically transformed into Miku cosplay. http://anidb.net/ch11062 [Kondou Mikoto] in the anime http://anidb.net/a6685 [Kampfer] appears dressed as Miku in episode seven. Miku also makes a cameo appearance in the anime http://anidb.net/a6176 [Sora o Kakeru Shoujo] as well as getting cosplayed by http://anidb.net/ch2254 [Kannagi Itsuki] in the second picture drama.</description>
