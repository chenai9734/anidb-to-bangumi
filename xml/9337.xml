<description>In 2059, five decades after Space War I, http://anidb.net/ch42821 [Macross Frontier], the 25th New Macross Class super-long-distance colonization fleet, is journeying through the galaxy to a new paradise to call home. However, it is locked in a state of war with a strange enemy called Vajra.
http://anidb.net/ch2171 [Ozma Lee], the leader of the S.M.S. Skull Team that is fighting the Vajra on the frontlines, encounters a mysterious lifeform, different from even the Vajra, one day. This mysterious lifeform shares visual memories of a certain other colonization fleet with Ozma, his stepsibling http://anidb.net/ch2166 [Ranka Lee], and her friend http://anidb.net/ch30 [Sheryl Nome].

<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

Though the latter - head-related features - may vary. As "DearS" shows some aliens actually exhibit super-human beauty, or as in the case of "Onegai Teacher" they are genetically compatible to humans for some strange reason.</description>

<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<description>Known as the "Galactic Fairy", she is a pop idol from Macross Galaxy fleet who had constantly topped music charts leading people to say that it was impossible not to hear her songs if you lived in this galaxy. As such, her popularity was soaring just as high in the Galaxy`s sister fleet, Macross Frontier. Due to her beauty and singing talent, she is a very proud and self-assured person. Sheryl recognizes the singing talent of Ranka Lee and often offers to help her `behind the scenes` to realise her dream of singing. Sheryl`s first encounter with Alto Saotome was when he served as a backup `performer` at her first concert in Frontier. Eventually, she also develops a crush on him.</description>

<description>Ranka Lee is a petite, lively and cheerful (although naive) teenage girl with green hair.
She suffered from amnesia as a result from witnessing the destruction of the 117th Long Distance Research Fleet in which her biological family perished. She is one-quarter Zentradi, which gives her the ability to have her hair move on its own according to her feelings as well as an above-average resistance to the vacuum of space.
As the adopted younger sister of S.M.S. ace Ozma Lee, she initially attends an all-girl`s high school at the urging of her brother while working part-time at the Chinese restaurant "Nyan-Nyan". She later transfers to the Mihoshi Academy to facilitate her singing career after being discovered at the Miss Macross contest. Later she played a role of http://anidb.net/ch14112 [Mao Nome] in the Bird Human movie.
Ranka started off as a huge fan of Sheryl Nome as she loved singing since her childhood and had dreamt of becoming a singer. She develops a crush on Alto Saotome, especially after being rescued by him when the Vajra first attacked the Macross Frontier fleet.</description>

His penchant for naming objects with Biblical names extends to his EX-Gear, which he calls "Samson". He is also the heir to the L.A.I. corporation, which means he has access to exotic, prototype technologies and is somewhat involved in Grace and Leon`s plans.</description>

He is somewhat overprotective of his sister Ranka Lee, and lies to her about his work so she will not worry about him, telling her he has a desk job in a company`s personnel department.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Maximilian Jenius is a fighter pilot from Europe, married to http://anidb.net/ch41157 [Milia Fallyna Jenius].
Prior to the events of Macross 7, Max is appointed commander of the 7th Macross Fleet and captain of the flagship Battle 7, with a de-micronized Exsedol Folmo as his advisor. Although separated from Milia, he is in almost-daily contact with her, due to her position as mayor of the civilian ship City 7, and possibly continues to harbor feelings for her. Despite being in his fifties, Max appears to have aged very little from his original appearance. Character designer Haruhiko Mikimoto half-jokingly said that is the case "Because he`s a genius. Growing old is a state of mind for average men...".
Max and Milia, in addition to being legally separated from each other, are also separated from most of their children - all but their youngest daughter, Mylene Flare Jenius, have moved away from the Macross 7 fleet. Max often checks up on Mylene, whom he feels very protective of. As the series progresses, Max becomes responsible for the establishment of "Sound Force", a trio of Valkyries piloted by the members of Fire Bomber which includes Mylene. Initially, he forbids Mylene from joining Sound Force, for fear of putting her life in danger, but is persuaded to allow her to join after witnessing her skill as a pilot and musician. Max often clashes with Milia about Mylene, but the two are able to remain civil (usually) around each other for the sake of their daughter, who unsuccessfully tries to bring them together again.
Late in the series, Max and Milia are able to overcome their troubled past and resume flying together in their distinctive blue and red VF-22 Sturmvogels in order to save the fleet from threat posed by the Protodeviln. In the final battle, Max, Milia and Mylene fight side-by-side against Lord Geperunitch.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Milia Fallyna Jenius is an ace Quimeliquola Queadluun-Rau power armour pilot, a female of the giant race of warriors known as the Zentradi.
In Macross 7 Milia sports a new short hairdo rather than her original long hair in Macross. Like Max, she doesn`t seem to have aged. However, she is sensitive whenever people, especially Basara Nekki refer to her age.
Milia is elected overwhelmingly as the mayor of City 7, the largest and main ship of the Macross 7 colonization fleet. She is accompanied by Mylene, her daughter, who lives separately. Max is also present as commander of the Macross 7 fleet, although the couple are now separated. It is also implied that she still may have feelings for her estranged husband.
As City 7`s Mayor, Milia is determined not only to maintain law and order among her citizens, but to marry off the rebellious Mylene as well. In the series, Milia still possesses her red VF-1J Valkyrie, and like Max, she can still fly a Valkyrie exceptionally and as passionately as she did in the original Super Dimension Fortress Macross. Milia clearly shows signs of affection towards her antique red VF-1J when it was destroyed by Sivil while being piloted by Gamlin Kizaki.
Later in the series, Milia, while serving as City 7`s mayor, would from time-to-time pilot her Valkyrie - first piloting her VF-1J and gradually moving on to more advanced Valkyries, the VF-17D Nightmare and VF-22S Sturmvogel II respectively, all of which are coloured deep red - to assist the battle of the Macross 7 fleet against the Protodeviln and their Varauta Army. In the final episode of Macross 7, Milia and Max fought side-by-side in their own custom coloured VF-22 Sturmvogel variable fighters against Lord Geperunitch.

<description>Commander of the Varauta Army. Uncouth and rebellious, he frequently vexes http://anidb.net/ch43875 [Geperuniti] by violating orders and launching all-out spiritia raids on the Macross 7 fleet. Indeed, it emerges that his real aim—other than to preserve the joy of the hunt over the Spiritia Farm Project—is to gather enough spiritia to reawaken not himself or http://anidb.net/ch43875 [Geperuniti], but another Protodeviln named http://anidb.net/ch43707 [Sivil], with whom he is in love. This earns the anger of the other Protodeviln, who attempt to destroy him, but when he discovers the power of singing from http://anidb.net/ch49391 [Fire Bomber]`s lead singer http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Nekki Basara], he begins to generate his own spiritia and reawakens in his earlier form, a giant humanoid creature with no human facial features. Such is the intensity of his desire to protect http://anidb.net/ch43707 [Sivil] that he generates an enormously powerful energy field which destroys the planet Lux and, to the horror of everyone, himself.Source: wiki</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A female Protodeviln who resembles a vampire, Sivil is awakened by http://anidb.net/ch43648 [Gigile], but being an undisciplined, free spirit, she ignores the other Protodeviln in order to seek her own supply of spiritia. She becomes fascinated by http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Nekki Basara], whom she terms Anima Spiritia, and possesses human women in an attempt to get close to him. However, his singing appears to cause her pain (or overwhelming pleasure), driving her away many times, and when she finally manages to kiss him, the energy released sends her into a coma. She is later reawakened byhttp://anidb.net/ch10993 [ Basara] and http://anidb.net/ch43648 [Gigile]`s combined singing, but http://anidb.net/ch43875 [Geperuniti] considers her a danger to his plan and seeks to destroy her. Though she never returns http://anidb.net/ch43648 [Gigile]`s feelings, she is shocked by his sacrifice in her name, and because of this seeks to protect http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Basara] from the other Protodeviln, and indeed, from her own desire to feed on his spiritia.Source: wiki</description>

<description>Gavil is a human-sized being covered in white fur, with wings like those of an angel. He disdains the innate abilities of his kind in favor of technology, piloting his own http://anidb.net/ch49550 [Saubergeran] and using anti-noise and remote-controlled fighters to combat the effects of http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Basara]`s singing. Extremely vain and arrogant, he delights in the "beauty" of destruction, particularly that created by http://anidb.net/ch49520 [Glavil], whom he regards as his own "flesh" -- yet he remains loyal to the plans of Lord http://anidb.net/ch43875 [Geperuniti], though he occasionally questions his leader`s methods. He develops an intense hatred of ace pilot http://anidb.net/ch41155 [Gamlin Kizaki], who humiliates him time and again in battle, most notably on many occasions destroying his vehicle and forcing him to retreat under his own power.

<description>The leader of the Protodeviln. Geperuniti aims to implement the Spiritia Farm Project of which he has dreamed: Humans and Zentradi will be kept as cattle and harvested for their spiritia, making hunting unnecessary and, more importantly, preventing another Spiritia Black Hole from forming. This plan comes to the fore when he learns that the singing of Anima Spiritia, and in particular the band http://anidb.net/ch49391 [Fire Bomber], causes humans to regenerate their spiritia: he lures first the Macross 5 and then the Macross 7 fleets to an Earth-like planet (dubbed Lux by the crew of the former fleet), intending to trap and corral them there. Although the planet is ultimately destroyed, he has by this time transported the citizens of Macross 5 back to Varauta IV, intending to capture and use the band to create an endless supply of spiritia.Source: wiki</description>
