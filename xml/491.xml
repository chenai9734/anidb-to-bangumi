<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="512389">Intelligent, assured and satisfying revisit to Maison Ikkoku.  Unlike the Kimagure Orange Road movies, it`s not a "big" movie — no spectacular plot development here.  This is low-key, low-budget and leisurely paced, and its focus remains cleverly within the walls of the boarding house throughout.  Some new avenues are explored, and some familiar pleasures rekindled.  The other Ikkoku OVAs are dispensable, but if you watched the series then DO watch this.</recommendation>

<name>puppeteer</name>
<description>A person who manipulates an inanimate object, such as a puppet, in real time to create the illusion of life. The puppeteer may be visible to or hidden from the audience. A puppeteer can operate a puppet indirectly by the use of strings, rods, wires, electronics or directly by his or her own hands placed inside the puppet or holding it externally. Some puppet styles require puppeteers to work together as a team to create a single puppet character.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>elements</name>
<description>Next to Themes setting the backdrop for the protagonists in anime, there are the more detailed plot Elements that centre on character interactions: "What do characters do to each other or what is done to them?". Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>alcohol</name>
<description>Alcohol (or more scientifically, ethanol), is one of the world`s oldest psychoactive substances. It is traditionally found in the form of a beverage such as beer, wine, or liquor, although in some contexts it can be inhaled to produce similar or intoxication, and some people prefer another way of consuming beverage-form alcohol.
Alcoholic beverages are many and varied, due to production methods (fermentation or distillation), source materials (grains, fruits, vegetables, other plants), added substances such as flavorings, and many more ways of defining different forms of alcoholic beverages.
Alcoholic beverages are divided into three general classes: beers, wines, and spirits. They are legally consumed in most countries, and over 100 countries have laws regulating their production, sale, and consumption. In particular, such laws specify the minimum age at which a person may legally buy or drink them. This minimum age varies between 16 and 25 years, depending upon the country and the type of drink. Most nations set it at 18 years of age.</description>

<name>Otonashi Kyouko</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Otonashi Kyouko is a beautiful, 22-year-old widow who takes on the task of managing a broken-down boarding house.
She lives in the manager`s room (with no room number, a reference to the 無 in her name meaning "zero" or "null").
She is sweet and polite, but she also has a violent, frightening side that emerges when she is jealous - a trait she has in common with other Rumiko Takahashi heroines, e.g., Akane Tendou (from Ranma ½), Lum Invader and Shinobu Miyake (from Urusei Yatsura), Sister Angela (from One-Pound Gospel), Kagome Higurashi and Sango (from InuYasha) - or dealing with her meddling parents.
She soon develops affection for Yuusaku, and has a tendency to dote over him (the other tenants tease her for acting "like a good wife") and sometimes becomes jealous around him (though she denies it is jealousy). However, it is hard for her to forget about her late husband "Mr. Soichirou" (Soichirou-san, who died just six months after the wedding), and her memories of her husband sometimes put her in a melancholic mood. Kyouko`s love for him is sometimes reflected in dialogues with her dog, who bears the same name as her late husband.
She is two years older than Godai and being a widow is one of the many worries she has later on about whether she will be accepted as his fiancée.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Godai Yuusaku is the protagonist of the series. He begins as a poor 20-year-old rounin studying for his college entrance exams after failing in the past year. He eventually gets into a third-tier college (with Kyouko`s help). He is kind-hearted and handsome, but indecisive and spacey.
Yuusaku is often played by the other tenants of Ikkoku, who habitually take advantage of him (e.g. they use his room for frequent drinking binges and steal food from his care packages).
He falls in love with Kyouko at first sight, but lacks the courage to tell her how he feels. Instead, he daydreams a lot and does numerous silly things.
During the course of the series Yuusaku matures into an honorable man who becomes worthy of Kyouko, as his love for her grows from an infatuation to a lasting and devoted love.
He lives in Room 5 (Go).</description>

Akemi, Mrs. Ichinose and Yotsuya love when she visits as she always joins them in their drinking, however "Grandma" Godai does not torment Yuusaku in quite the same way. She truly cares for her grandson, recognizes his situation with Kyouko, and her schemes are ultimately constructive for the two of them (and, in contrast to Mrs. Ichinose, she`s far more successful at it).</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A mysterious man who finds enjoyment in mooching, voyeurism, and generally tormenting his next-door neighbor Yuusaku; he is famous for breaking a hole through the adjoining wall in order to be with "young Godai" (and to use a smaller hole in the wall of Yuusaku`s room to peep into Akemi`s). He is usually seen dressed in a business suit, a yukata or similarly formal attire and tends to speak in a very formal manner (even while drinking and partying with Akemi and Mrs. Ichinose), but what life he may have outside of Maison Ikkoku is a complete mystery to everyone. Yotsuya claims to have a job (but is not above stealing Yuusaku`s food) and comes and goes at odd and changing hours, keeping a schedule known only to himself. He torments Yuusaku directly and Kyouko indirectly, as it is her job to repair the damage done by him. He lives in Room 4 (Yon). His given name in unknown. He provided more than one given name, including Tamezo and Goro. His true name, like his profession, remains a mystery. Yotsuya, which means "four valleys" and is the name of a district in Tokyo associated with a famous ghost story.</description>

<description>A boozy bar hostess who is usually known to lounge around wearing skimpy lingerie while hanging around Ikkoku; Mrs. Ichinose occasionally complains when strangers are around, but generally the tenants have gotten used to her ways. She lives in Room 6 (Roku) and works a short distance away in a bar named Cha-Cha Maru, where the tenants gather to drink when not in Yuusaku`s room. She is known to let some of the bar`s male patrons buy her too many drinks, and often comes home from work drunk. Because she works the late-night shift at the Cha-Cha Maru, and because she spends the rest of the night drinking, she has a constant sleepy look on her face. She is generally aloof towards both Yuusaku and Kyouko, but she is not above joining Mr. Yotsuya in tormenting Yuusaku. She will often display a blatant sexual interest in Shun Mitaka when he is around, even though she is fully aware of his interest in Kyouko. Her family name (which means "six trees") is also the name of a Tokyo district infamous for expensive hostess bars Roppongi.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Ichinose Hanae is a short, middle-aged woman who is rarely seen sober. Her wage-slave husband seldom appears in the manga and is completely unknown to the other tenants until he gets temporarily laid off. She enjoys joining in with the other tenants to stir up trouble for Yuusaku and Kyouko, but she occasionally acts with good intentions for the two, especially Kyouko, whom she sees as a "younger sister" (willfully ignoring the difference in their ages, as the other tenants point out). However, even when she is acting with the best of intentions, her way of doing things often leave Yuusaku, Kyouko, or both in worse situations than if she had not gotten involved. Mrs. Ichinose is also an incurable gossip who relishes her room`s proximity to the communal telephone.
She lives with her husband and her son Kentarou in Room 1 (Ichi-no-se means "first ford").</description>

He is also very fond of Kyouko, especially because he sees her as the only sane person in the building other than himself. He develops a crush on Kyouko`s niece Ikuko, reminding Yuusaku of himself, although Kentarou resents the comparison.</description>

<description>A large, white, "mangy" dog, found as a stray by Souichirou Otonashi. He was originally named "Shiro" ("Whitey"), but he only responds to the name "Souichirou" and so Kyouko insists on calling him "Souichirou" in memory of her husband. Other than providing comic relief, he serves to remind both Kyouko and Yuusaku of the man he was named after, and serves as a foil to Shun Mitaka. Kentarou enjoys playing with him and considers him his pet.
In Ranma ½, volume 7, page 158, Souichirou`s name appears on a box saying "Please take me home. My name is Souichirou" while Happousai is hiding under it.</description>

<description>Kyouko`s parents. Initially against Kyouko`s marriage to Soichiro, they (especially her mother, Ritsuko) wish to see their daughter continue her life, preferably remarrying. Ritsuko is quite taken with Shun and sees him as a suitable husband for her daughter, while Kyouko`s father sees the handsome Shun as a potential womanizer who will only break his "little girl`s" heart. Neither of them seem to notice Yuusaku`s existence (their inability to remember his name is used as a running gag), let alone the bond both he and Kyouko share, and their obsession with Shun only frustrates Yuusaku. However, later on Ritsuko showed some support for Godai since she just wanted Kyouko to re-marry, and that at the time Shun was no longer an option to Kyouko (Shun had married Asuna). Both Ritsuko and Kyouko tend to address Mr. Chigusa as "Daddy" or "Father".</description>

<description>A classically demure Japanese maiden from a wealthy family (Kujou family implied), Asuna is pretty, kind-hearted, shy around people and innocent to a fault. Her family and Shun`s uncle has arranged a traditional Japanese marriage between she and Shun (against Shun`s wishes). In contrast to Shun, Asuna is a dog lover and she is initially attracted to Shun (approving of their engagement) because her many dogs seem to approve of him. Shun would like to end their arranged engagement, but often finds himself unable to, either because of his fear of her dogs or his fear of hurting her feelings (mirroring the situation between Yuusaku and Kozue). Asuna is initially unaware of Shun`s feelings for Kyouko, but she is not above pursuing Shun, albeit in her own fashion. She was born in 1964.</description>

<description>Nikaidou Nozumu appears only in the manga and the movie. His lines are largely given to Yotsuya or Kentarou in the TV series.
Nozomu`s family name, Ni-kai-dou, means "two-story temple". In ancient Japan, two-story buildings were extremely rare, especially in the rural areas, and an occasional two-story building constructed at Buddhist Temples would awe the locals to such an extent that Ni-kai-dou would become the place name for the area.</description>
