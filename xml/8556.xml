<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="558171">It`s a well written and intriguing TV serie. I recommend it to the horror fans, because this TV serie has a lot of violence, gore and thriller scenes. Also the imponderable ending make the serie unique.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="33393">It was a decent show. The suspense was decent and I was still guessing in the last episode who the culprit was. The lead male character was about as flat and lifeless as possible but the female lead was interesting enough to keep me watching. the music was pretty good and the animation decent.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="255559">high school version of final destination
for whoever who like moe char
not for horror fans who like ghost stuff</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="484118">Fans of the horror/gore genres will enjoy it. Suspense, interesting characters. Overall a decent watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="507788">This is a good show. Plenty creepy and atmospheric through the first 5 eps. Many people die throughout, gruesomely, in the manner of horror movies. There`s a neat reveal in Ep 5, and then it gets less scary and turns into a more-traditional "detective" show, eventually culminating in a morally-twisty battle royale spectacle near the end.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="526461">this is a good Anime for those who luv a good level of susupence and thriller
keeps you in a  sense of wonder who is going to be the next victim
pls watch it...... its a great Anime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="516857">just finished eps. 3, good plot, a bit slow in story development, but still a good story, a bit like Higurashi but concentrate in Rika Furude who can see Hanyu.
If u a fan of mistery anime, i guees this would be a good add for your colection.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="527292">Very entertaining to say the least, super graphic and suspenseful to say the least but very enjoyable... If your a fan of mystery and dont mind some crazy gore definitely watch. One of the best horror animes i have seen! The ending is wonderful btw :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="293285">One of my fav. anime so fat. real intense suspense anime. you will love this from the 1st ep. to last</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="162764">Each episode causes a urge to see the next, but I don`t know toward what the show is aiming. Lets see...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="437695">decent suspense you can`t call it highschool version of final destination but it is worth watch</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="129591">This is the best horror anime I`ve seen this year. It was very stable expect some cliches. It drives u in and without knowing you finish 12 episode in one night. Must see for who like horror stuff.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="12332">Apart from several minor slips in the storyline it is a really nice written tale with good thought-through mystery an quite a suspense (though it may not seem like it at the beginning). I did not think that there is a possibility to make decent horror serialised, especially in anime that seems not to be best medium for one, but I was wrong. In anime one could presume lots of almost humorous gore, absurdly deformed evildoers etc. but here there is no such thing (well, there is some gore but as a measure not a goal itself). Instead we got aforementioned good storyline together with really good animation with photo-based backgrounds and nicely done characters, which adds the necessary reality feeling. But of course you need to like horror stories not for gore but for the story part to appreciate this series, therefore if you don`t you probably won`t be as moved as I was.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="242116">Quite good, though I didnt like the reasoning. But it had some really good cliffhangers. Definitely worth watching</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="377823">Mix together one spoon of Final Destination, one spoon of Lord of the Flies, and tint of Higurashi, and then you have Another.  It`s a mixed bag to say the least.  Delivers some good horror and cliffhangers, but the character interactions were strange and the rationale of some of the plot twists didn`t really seem to make much sense.  Worth a look.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="281995">This one caught me by surprise. It seems to take ideas from several other sources of the same genre, but in the end, it`s really good on its own right. Once you start watching, you won`t be able to stop. Great animation, story and characters.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="832296">Young boy arrives to a small town... Despite this start, it`s not "Higurashi" clone. In fact, this anime resembles rather classic of J-horror, like "Ringu" or "Ju-On". Mysterious curse spreads between teenagers, killing them or their families...
This anime has only one disadvantage: it`s too short. That`s why we have to read the manga or novel, to reveal the whole mystery. If only this anime was longer, or there was a sequel, faithfully reflecting the manga`s plot, it would be perfect... and I would mark it as "must see" instead of "recommended".</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="25462">To think i almost dropped this show after 2 Eps... its true, the first two episodes are not really that interesting. But after that you are in for a hell of a ride. I dont mean action or epicness but the sheer madness of what is going on. 
And seemingly we get more gore every episode. 
Totally recommended. 
WARNING: do NOT watch EP7 if you easily catch nightmares.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="594546">I highly recommend this Anime because, most Anime just don`t give you the feeling of investment in these characters. I mean there could be a character that you knew in the show for the first few minutes and then the few episodes later he/she dies or maybe in the last episode. This Anime just made me worry about most of the students fates, especially the girls. I don`t know why, but when and if I ever see a girl hurt dying or in a gory situation herself, I feel the need to kill and torture the living **** out of that mother******! Though, I am ok with a guy dying on screen. Either I am crazy or just a weirdo. Anyways, watch this show, I highly freaking recommend it!!!! :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="503287">I had just finished the second episode and I am already wanting more, I enjoy how it is already sucking me in, but I believe that this anime, `Another` reminds me a bit like Higurashi or Elfen Lied, but still my taste. I recommend it for many. ^^</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="770700">A horror anime classic in my opinion.
Got some good gory scenes, lots of with elements with suspense and thrillers.
It keeps you guessing from start to finish. If you`re just getting into horror anime then this should be number one on your list. Mind you it starts slow but as soon as things start happening it`s amazing and keeps you on the edge of your seat.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="527075">Now this is finally an anime which plays in the same league of Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni.

It is a blast.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="486289">it`s really awesome, the mystery, score, and accident some like final destination make me shiver</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="337937">I think this anime was pretty well made.  For a horror anime, it has everything - mysterious characters, unexpected twists and turns, gore and blood - lots and lots of it!  It wasn`t predictable, and though it started off slow, it was perfect for setting up the story.  All in all, the anime is short and sweet.  Really a must see, not just for horror fans, but for everyone who appreciates great storytelling.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="541485">I honestly didn`t think this was going to be any good! But it was AMAZING. Great Story, &amp; Twisted Ending. I Recommend it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="556152">Starts off a little slow yes, but that`s not a bad thing either. Because of the little slow story progression, you get to understand the characters, and the story a little, also the story, is one of the best i`ve ever seen, and i must say, it`s a must see, even if you`re not into horror i think you can watch, this since it`s not as scary, as one may think. Amazing go watch nothing more to say.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="728642">A tiny bit slow in the beginning (1st 2 eps) but well worth it. Was hooked by the end. You really shouldn`t regret watching this thriller. Isn`t super scary but the suspense is awesome!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="269601">Very refined horror with a nice mix of mystery. Good horror series are so rare this is definitely a must see for those who can handle a bit of blood.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="525522">My friend started asking about horror/thriller type anime the other day, and the only ones I had seen was the Higurashi series. I know alot of people who like Higurashi, but I really don`t like the way its presented. Then after searching a bit, I found Another. Honestly the best of the genre, in my opinion. It flows very well and it tells a really gripping story. I was questioning what I thought the whole way through. Everyone should see this anime, even if they aren`t fans of the genre. It tells a great plot and has tons of emotions all the way through and the pacing is excellent. I wish more series were like this, and I wish all the "horror" movies in USA could be influenced by this, definitely a chilling experience and the way it should be done.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="474925">If you liked Higurashi, you`ll love this. Most of what I watch is light-hearted and even comedic, this was neither and I want to watch it again after finishing the last episode 10 min ago. A fair warning though, some of the sequences may be a bit disturbing like those found in Higurashi. It has a heavy supernatural element to it for those who want to know.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on a horror/mystery novel by http://anidb.net/cr27951 [Ayatsuji Yukito], originally serialised in the Yasei Jidai magazine.
26 years ago, in a third-year classroom of a middle school, there was a student named Misaki. As an honours student, also good at sports, the charming guy was popular with his classmates. When he suddenly died, his classmates decided to carry on as if he was still alive until graduation. Then, in the spring of 1998, a boy named http://anidb.net/ch38513 [Sakakibara Kouichi] transfers to that class, and he grows suspicious of the fearful atmosphere in that classroom. In particular, there is a beautiful, aloof girl named http://anidb.net/ch35866 [Misaki Mei] who wears an eyepatch and is always alone drawing pictures.</description>

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>amnesia</name>
<description>The character suffers from some kind of amnesia (memory disturbance or loss). This may mean inability to memorize new information, or inability to recollect old memories. Since there are many types of memory, the person may e.g. forget who they are but still retain learned skills.
Amnesia is fairly common in fiction as a plot device. In fact, because it allows for major plot changes while requiring little creativity from the author, it may be subject to heavy overuse.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Even though school clubs in Japan are not mandatory, there is some pressure from the social grid (e.g. fellow students, teachers) to participate in some kind of after-school activity, be it in sports or arts. Colleges also have clubs.
As a comedy element in anime, some students have joined too many clubs, and are thus constantly stressed out. There is also the element of social commentary, making it clear that you have to join a club, if you want to be part of the class. Since self-founded clubs need at least 3 members, the desperate search and advertising for new members can be cause for hilarity in anime.</description>

<name>thriller</name>
<description>The thriller is a genre of fiction in which tough, resourceful, but essentially ordinary heroes are pitted against villains determined to destroy them, their country, or the stability of the free world. The hero of a typical thriller faces danger alone or in the company of a small band of companions. The protagonist may be a law enforcement agent, a journalist, or a soldier, but typically he or she is cut off from the resources of "their" organization. More often the hero is an ordinary citizen drawn into danger and intrigue by circumstances beyond their control.

<name>school life</name>
<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

<name>gore</name>
<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<description>A "curse" in this manner depicts an adversity placed upon a person or object by a supernatural power often represented by unique designs and symbols found on the inflicted. While not all curses have negative effects, the majority are meant to remain forever hexing to the receiving victim`s soul.
A common portrayal is that which is conjured by an individual that has been caused great suffering and thereby extracts revenge against the accuser in the form of a curse. This abuser will then have their soul spirited away to hell to suffer endlessly for the rest of eternity. In some instances (such as in `Jigoku Shoujo`) the character who extracts revenge also condemns their own soul to Hell upon death.</description>

However it arises, at least one character in this anime can see little good in the world or the people in it.</description>

<description>Sannen Sankumi (3rd Grade, Class 3), is one of the classrooms at Yomiyama North Middle School. It is one of the primary settings of Another.
26 years ago, there was a student named Yomiyama Misaki. He was a charming student, good looking and excelled in both academics and sport. All the teachers and students admired him. In his 9th grade, he was placed in class 3. Shortly after entering 9th grade, he died in an accident (there are many theories about this, some saying he died from plane crash and some saying because of fire). Unable to accept his death, his classmates decided to continue acting as if he is alive (talking with his desk, going home with him). Even at graduation, the principal arranged to have his seat included. After graduation, they took a picture of the class and found Misaki, who wasn`t supposed to appear, included, with a pale face, but smiling like everyone else. After that incident, the class has been cursed and placed closer to death.
It started in 1973, a year after when they found out about having an extra student and were one desk short. At first they just thought it was an error and ignored it. But six students and ten of their family members died that year. Since then they found out that there is a `dead one` in the class. The `dead one` is the person who died a year or a few years before, but somehow they have been placed in that class (The dead person can be a student or a teacher). All the memories of the people around the `dead person` are altered, so the other students think that he/she is still alive. The dead person also doesn`t realize that they`re already dead. Because of that, at least one student or their family members die each month. This happened because of the countermeasures in Class 3-3 in 1972. The students before have tried many ways to prevent this, including changing the classroom and the class name from class 3-3 to 3-C. However it didn`t work. Until 10 years ago, they found out that in order to prevent the calamity they have `to treat a person as they don`t exist to make up for the presence of the dead person`.
In 1998, the class chose to treat Misaki Mei as if she didn`t exist, but the newly transfered student, Sakakibara Kouichi doesn`t know about the class curse and acknowledges her. Because of this, two students and three family members died. After that, the class treats both Mei and Kouichi as they never existed.</description>

<description>Fujioka Misaki is Misaki Mei`s cousin. She died from a kidney disease shortly before the anime begins.
She is actually Misaki Mei`s twin sister, Mei having been adopted by her aunt. Though they were raised separately, they occasionally met each other. She was the one Mei was visiting in the morgue when Kouichi first saw her. Misaki`s death is probably the first one which can be attributed to the calamity.</description>
