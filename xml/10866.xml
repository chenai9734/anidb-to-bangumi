<description>In Ikebukuro, the lives of its citizens continue intertwining with each other as if their fates are predestined. http://anidb.net/ch12150 [Ryuugamine Mikado] is now one step closer to his goal of living an exciting life, and in turn, delves deeper into the darker side of Ikebukuro. After gaining absolute control over a former rival, he uses his newfound power as he pleases, purging the Dollars from the inside to mold it into the ideal organization. This proves to be as challenging as it sounds as Mikado must now deal with unwanted outside interference, most notably a re-emerging and dearly missed friend. Meanwhile, http://anidb.net/ch12153 [Orihara Izaya] still has some schemes up his sleeve, although a rival information exchange center has proven to be quite the hindrance, lurking within everyone`s favorite downtown district. Undoubtedly, sooner or later, chaos will strike again.

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>mafia</name>
<description>A mafia is a type of organized crime syndicate whose primary activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions. Secondary activities may be practiced such as gambling, drug trafficking, loan sharking, and fraud. The term was originally applied to the Sicilian mafia, but has since expanded to encompass other organizations of similar methods and purpose, such as in "the Russian mafia" or "the Japanese mafia", and is applied informally by the press and public, but the criminal organizations themselves have their own terms; for example, the original Sicilian and Italian-American mafia call themselves "cosa nostra", while the Japanese mafia calls itself "yakuza".

<description>Also known as "The Black Rider" or "The Headless Rider", she is a Dullahan from Ireland who came to Japan looking for her stolen head. Her motorcycle is actually a horse in disguise. She has no heart and perceives via unknown sensors that are not located on the head. The physical strength she possesses is above human, though not quite on par with Shizuo Heiwajima. She is also capable of manipulating a shadow-like, durable substance to form objects ranging from gloves to chariots at her will.
Selty lives with Shinra Kishitani and works as an underground porter. She wears a helmet when she goes out and communicates via a PDA. She enjoys online chatting, television and DVDs.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Ryuugamine Mikado is a first year high school boy who moved to Ikebukuro with the encouragement of his best friend, http://anidb.net/ch12151 [Kida Masaomi]. He moved in order to search for unusual beings and adventure. His greatest fear is having a normal life. Mikado tries hard to change his image but so far he has not had any luck, although he does get up enough courage to become the Class Representative along with http://anidb.net/ch12155 [Anri]. Mikado has had moments where he speaks his mind, and Masaomi claims to admire this about him. He is the only remaining creator of the infamous http://anidb.net/ch14864 [Dollars] and also its leader. He seems to be infatuated with Anri Sonohara, but has never found a chance to tell her. Whenever he is close to confessing, she leaves. Mikado often gets advice from http://anidb.net/ch12153 [Izaya], particularly in relation to the Dollars and his need to seek out a life that isn`t ordinary.
His online chat screenname is "Tanaka Taro".</description>

<description>Kida Masaomi is a resident of Ikebukuro and http://anidb.net/ch12150 [Ryuugamine Mikado]`s best friend from childhood. He was the one who encouraged Mikado to come to Ikebukuro. He is enthusiastic about picking-up girls, but he seems to fail at it. He was depressed and lonely before Mikado arrived because his girlfriend was kidnapped and injured during a gang war between the http://anidb.net/ch14887 [Blue Squares] and http://anidb.net/ch14865 [Yellow Scarves], which he led at the time. After http://anidb.net/ch12155 [Anri] is injured during the Slasher incidents and the rising presence of the http://anidb.net/ch14864 [Dollars], he is forced to become the leader of the Yellow Scarves once more. He despises http://anidb.net/ch12153 [Orihara Izaya] for manipulating him when he first formed the Yellow Scarves, but returns to him again for information about the leader of the Dollars and discovers it is Mikado. He leaves Ikebukuro with his ex-girlfriend, http://anidb.net/ch14873 [Mikajima Saki], during the conflict between the 3 main forces in Ikebukuro. Masaomi has commented on not letting Mikado "go to the dark side," claiming that he has already gone through it.

<name>Heiwajima Shizuo</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A man who is always seen to wear sunglasses and a bartender`s suit. Although quiet and nondescript while not angered, he has a very short fuse and fights with incredible strength. Despite his simple and unrefined fighting skills, he is often considered the strongest fighter in the series. In the novels his power is described as the naturally unlimited form of human strength and likened to "adrenaline power" that can give people superhuman strength in times of emergency. In addition, Shizuo is capable of often superhuman parkour moves, a skill he obtained naturally from years of hunting down Izaya Orihara.
He works as a debt collector in Ikebukuro and carries intense animosity towards Izaya. He has a younger brother, Kasuka, who is a top idol under the showbiz name of Hanejima Yuuhei. He is also a long-time acquaintance of Selty.
His first and last name translates literally into "serene man" and "peaceful island" respectively.</description>

<name>Orihara Izaya</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Orihara Izaya is a young man who sells information for his own enjoyment. He claims to love the entire human race except for Shizuo Heiwajima, and exhibits said love by putting humans in often miserable conditions and observing their reactions.
He attended Raira Academy with Shizuo, Shinra and Kadota. According to Shinra, Izaya and Shizuo hated each other with a passion almost from the point they met. In the novels Izaya framed Shizuo for crimes on several occasions.
He is a master of parkour, and also quite skilled with his flickblade (the blade he uses must be slightly opened before the mechanics of it springs the blade open - a switchblade will open on its own after the user presses a switch) as he is implied to be the only one capable of leaving numerous cuts in Shizuo`s bartender suit after a fight in the novels. In the anime, he shaves a gang member`s head bald without him noticing it. Izaya has two younger sisters, Mairu and Kururi, who are twins and troublemakers.
His name comes from a combination of the biblical Isaiah and Japanese for "the one who looks over the crowd".
He is usually seen pretending to be female online and talks in a feminine manner in the chatroom. His screenname is "Kanra".</description>

<description>Shizuo`s brother.
Nowadays a famous actor and model under the name Hanejima Yuuhei (羽島 幽平), he was scouted in place of his brother when he saved the talent scout from one of his outbursts of anger. After some modeling and his debut as lead actor in the film Vampire Ninja Kaamira Saizou he gained slowly popularity over the net because of his acting abilities. After an appearance in the popular show Money Gamer, where he made 1.2 billion Yen through money investments within a month, his name appeared nationwide on news reports prompting his stardom followed by a number of leading cast appearances in TV drama.
Although a star excelling with a broad range of acting skills, once he is not in front of a camera it is as though he would lose any emotion and revert to a roboter-like state. But it is exactly this very nature of him, which makes him an idol amongst his many fans, who love his "cool expression".</description>
