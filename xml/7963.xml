<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>Otonashi Kyouko</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Otonashi Kyouko is a beautiful, 22-year-old widow who takes on the task of managing a broken-down boarding house.
She lives in the manager`s room (with no room number, a reference to the 無 in her name meaning "zero" or "null").
She is sweet and polite, but she also has a violent, frightening side that emerges when she is jealous - a trait she has in common with other Rumiko Takahashi heroines, e.g., Akane Tendou (from Ranma ½), Lum Invader and Shinobu Miyake (from Urusei Yatsura), Sister Angela (from One-Pound Gospel), Kagome Higurashi and Sango (from InuYasha) - or dealing with her meddling parents.
She soon develops affection for Yuusaku, and has a tendency to dote over him (the other tenants tease her for acting "like a good wife") and sometimes becomes jealous around him (though she denies it is jealousy). However, it is hard for her to forget about her late husband "Mr. Soichirou" (Soichirou-san, who died just six months after the wedding), and her memories of her husband sometimes put her in a melancholic mood. Kyouko`s love for him is sometimes reflected in dialogues with her dog, who bears the same name as her late husband.
She is two years older than Godai and being a widow is one of the many worries she has later on about whether she will be accepted as his fiancée.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Godai Yuusaku is the protagonist of the series. He begins as a poor 20-year-old rounin studying for his college entrance exams after failing in the past year. He eventually gets into a third-tier college (with Kyouko`s help). He is kind-hearted and handsome, but indecisive and spacey.
Yuusaku is often played by the other tenants of Ikkoku, who habitually take advantage of him (e.g. they use his room for frequent drinking binges and steal food from his care packages).
He falls in love with Kyouko at first sight, but lacks the courage to tell her how he feels. Instead, he daydreams a lot and does numerous silly things.
During the course of the series Yuusaku matures into an honorable man who becomes worthy of Kyouko, as his love for her grows from an infatuation to a lasting and devoted love.
He lives in Room 5 (Go).</description>

He is usually seen dressed in a business suit, a yukata or similarly formal attire and tends to speak in a very formal manner (even while drinking and partying with Akemi and Mrs. Ichinose), but what life he may have outside of Maison Ikkoku is a complete mystery to everyone. Yotsuya claims to have a job (but is not above stealing Yuusaku`s food) and comes and goes at odd and changing hours, keeping a schedule known only to himself. He torments Yuusaku directly and Kyouko indirectly, as it is her job to repair the damage done by him. He lives in Room 4 (Yon). His given name in unknown. He provided more than one given name, including Tamezo and Goro. His true name, like his profession, remains a mystery.

She is known to let some of the bar`s male patrons buy her too many drinks, and often comes home from work drunk. Because she works the late-night shift at the Cha-Cha Maru, and because she spends the rest of the night drinking, she has a constant sleepy look on her face. She is generally aloof towards both Yuusaku and Kyouko, but she is not above joining Mr. Yotsuya in tormenting Yuusaku. She will often display a blatant sexual interest in Shun Mitaka when he is around, even though she is fully aware of his interest in Kyouko.

She enjoys joining in with the other tenants to stir up trouble for Yuusaku and Kyouko, but she occasionally acts with good intentions for the two, especially Kyouko, whom she sees as a "younger sister" (willfully ignoring the difference in their ages, as the other tenants point out). However, even when she is acting with the best of intentions, her way of doing things often leave Yuusaku, Kyouko, or both in worse situations than if she had not gotten involved. Mrs. Ichinose is also an incurable gossip who relishes her room`s proximity to the communal telephone.
She lives with her husband and her son Kentarou in Room 1 (Ichi-no-se means "first ford").</description>

<description>Otonashi Souichirou is Kyouko`s late husband. Kyouko and Souichirou met during high school when she was a student there and he was a temporary teacher. They eventually married, albeit with great opposition from Kyouko`s family. Souichirou died of an unspecified cause (accident is implied), leaving Kyouko a very young widow.
As a running gag, his face is never shown in the series (usually to Yuusaku`s frustration), always either in shadow or otherwise obscured in photographs.
Souichirou`s family, especially his father, is still very close to Kyouko who still holds on to the Otonashi family name.
The name Otonashi translates literally as "without sound", and Souichirou literally, as "all one", and means "most important".</description>

In contrast to Shun, Asuna is a dog lover and she is initially attracted to Shun (approving of their engagement) because her many dogs seem to approve of him. Shun would like to end their arranged engagement, but often finds himself unable to, either because of his fear of her dogs or his fear of hurting her feelings (mirroring the situation between Yuusaku and Kozue).

<description>Yagami Ibuki develops a crush on Yuusaku, when he briefly acts as a student-teacher in the high school she is attending. Ibuki was at first unimpressed with him but later develops a crush after misinterpreting him as a sort of tragic romantic hero.
Ibuki tends to hatch devious plots that put her together with Yuusaku, usually putting him into a compromising situation. Yuusaku is not interested in her, but is a pushover about it as always, and Ibuki refuses to be denied.
