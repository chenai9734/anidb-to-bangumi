<recommendations total="44">
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="364373">I like this show a lot; great animation and a pace that supports  rich character development.  I recommend it without reservation</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="474018">In short it`s slice of life about youngsters who play as some detective and solve ferial misteries. The animation is pretty good, but nothing else outstanding. Slow, realistic, harmless detective juvenile fiction with mild fanservice. The pace of the story can be found slow and some characters are overacted, so it can be boring or annoying for some people.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="253370">Like the main stories are good, but some of the sub story (sorta filler) have little to know "content" to it, making me feel if it was necessary.  Definitely not for people who are looking for some deep mystery, more like daily life mystery.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="36">A slice of life/detective combination which works out well despite the odd combination. Recommended for SoL fans who like a little bit of plot in the show.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="663539">As much as the characters are flesh out and the directing is good enough, there isn`t much going on, is fine as far slice of life goes but it can be pretty boring if you are hoping for anything at all</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="319389">First of all this show is not going to get 100% praise from me but, The animation is beautiful. The story is paced slowly to set the mood for the show. Some viewers may not like it but for once I actually like how this show is paced. My only issue with the show is I personally cannot stand the lead character. I expect alot from this show as it progresses.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="538893">It has great characterization, very good character development, and an excellent, subtle and realistic approach to and portrayal of its themes: from youth, growing up - as well as the adolescent troubles that entails - to learning how to enjoy things you`d usually take for granted, or finding your place in the "world".  

Everything is lead forward by really well done character interaction and a relatively fresh take on an old genre (mystery and puzzle solving), and everything is held together wonderfully by the great visual presentation (complete with great use of restrained artistic licence and low-key visual symbolism), animation, soundtrack and voice acting.

I`d say it`s the best that 2012 had to offer as far as anime series go.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="597419">Rating 9/10 : A series that holds a decent grasp on the mystery genre, it`s enough to get you into it, but not to much to overload your senses. The main character is the epitome of sloth, and i love it, If your into slice of life with abit of mystery and romance this is a great look.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="602204">Hyouka is defiantly one hell of an anime. I wasn`t so sure about it at the beginning but this anime- believe it or not- got much better toward the 2nd half! loved the cases they had to solve some were good some were just silly :P over all this is a good anime that worth you time.. give it a try</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="784472">Excellent character study with cinematographic cred for days. Some small mysteries, but primarily an exploration of its four main characters.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="573842">why is everybody afraid of love? O_o
great anime with loveble characters and good story.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="503773">a very decent show to watch
really nice visuals and a peaceful plot</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="305901">Pacing is slow but appropriate given the material and situations. Characters begin to flesh out a little deeper into the story as they begin to experience the trials of adolescence. So far the series has been unforgettable and I highly recommend to anime fans. (This is my first anime series since Nisemonogatari. Looks like the industry`s still got some juice left, albeit working at a much slower rate.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="369497">Get`s better as you start to feel, that it`s not about the mysteries.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="10957">A welcome change from a seemingly unending torrent of moeblob harem anime.  A slow but steady pacing, interesting story and likeable characters all combine together to make this an enjoyable series.  I think this will probably become one of my favourites from the past couple of years and definitely one I`ll watch again in the future.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="408027">this show is great! i hope season 2 will come.. :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="522616">Hum... it`s pretty good... great start and good development, very well writen and greatly executed. The only problem is the lacking of "Objective" you don`t truly see any "point". I know these types are like this, but there is just something missing when you get at the end.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="379734">This show is wonderful!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="191792">First of all, really good animation quality... one of the best of 2012.
On the first glance this show is just like another daily life or slice of life anime, there are no objective and kind of slow paced, but with all the logic and case solving involved this show becomes very amusing to watch. Usually anime like this gives "just enjoy the show" feeling but i find myself keep wanting more, cant wait for more and suddenly the show end, you know that kind of feeling when watching great show.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="332605">Skillfully animated detective stories. For the amateurs of slice of life-types animes.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="554983">Were it just for the quality of the animation, Hyouka is a must-see.
But they give us more than visual excellence, because this series is a gentle interlacing of mystery and school life, and the little romance which subdues the action is lovely (and secondary, this is not a romance-focused anime)...
The mysteries which are solved come from very simple facts and logical deductions, but are developed in a way that keeps you really interested.
In my opinion, the best anime of Summer 2012, maybe of the year.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="424823">One of the best anime of the last years. Excellent animation, original plot, wonderful character design, and everything perfectly blended together. Absolutely a must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="536175">it`s just awesome....must see 4 everyone</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="78827">The animation, soundtrack, voice acting and artwork are all a notch or two above the usual quality.  An engaging story told with flair and a good amount of subtext rounds this out into a must-see show.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="482219">Perfect. I just love the background music, the plot, the characters. Go and look at Hyouka. That is order!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="219300">I don`t want to say anything about it to ruin it so.. Just watch it it`s good. If nothing else see it for the animation..  It has solid op/ed`s as well.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="348110">Amazing, I can`t really think anything else to say about Hyouka. It`s just ridiculous how good this show is.

Must see for sure.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="556522">it has a slow and steady pace but surely has it`s own "bite" to it. (i`m not much of a lover of this genre but i got hooked in it). you still judge what you can say about it but it is definitely one of the must watch anime of 2012.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="291605">The best anime this season for me. Hyouka is an all rounder: great animation with good story and lovable characters. It`s a perfect mix of slice of life, romance, and light detective series</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="369649">Well, Hyouka`s finally over. And what a show it`s been, with great characters and a fantastic soundtrack. It`s a show you`ll love, no matter what genre you watch. I`ll miss my weekly Hyouka (and my well deserved moe) more than anything :(</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="243849">Great Anime, slice of life with a hint of romance and mystery, Characters are great and memorable</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="71577">It`s hard to describe how much I enjoyed this series. It felt very refreshing. Relaxing atmosphere filled with detective stories mixed with lovable characters and fantastic visuals/animation. Let`s just simply say I loved it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="611680">those people,interested in detective type anime, mystery,etc type must watch it!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="801594">One of the best school romance anime I have ever seen, even though the first 6 episodes you may find a bit boring. But overall, it gives us a very logical story. If you are looking for some type of animes with mysterious and romance inside. This one you definitely need to check it out. It`s probably one of the best work done by Kyoani .</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="311037">`tis the kind of anime without any major back-story. It doesn`t divulge the characters stories either. It just puts you in there, just as if you meet a group of exciting people one day and join their group. `tis that kind of feeling....

Oh and the OST is probably the best for this season...</recommendation>

<name>detective</name>
<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.

<name>bishoujo</name>
<description>In Japanese, a bishoujo is any pretty female from toddlerhood to late adolescence. In the West, the word specifically refers to attractive girls generally from late childhood or early adolescence, especially those that appeal to males, and particularly to fictional characters designed in a way traditionally associated to shoujo manga. Fictional bishoujo tend to be cute, pastel-coloured teenagers; they lack the sophistication of older women, instead having detailed eye and hair design, fluttery costumes often including ribbons, and all sorts of generally sparkly fluff.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Even though school clubs in Japan are not mandatory, there is some pressure from the social grid (e.g. fellow students, teachers) to participate in some kind of after-school activity, be it in sports or arts. Colleges also have clubs.
As a comedy element in anime, some students have joined too many clubs, and are thus constantly stressed out. There is also the element of social commentary, making it clear that you have to join a club, if you want to be part of the class. Since self-founded clubs need at least 3 members, the desperate search and advertising for new members can be cause for hilarity in anime.</description>

When not "at the job" this means getting up in the morning, making meals, house cleaning, going shopping or out to eat, visiting the bath house or spa, leisure activities in the spare time, etc. The time "on the job" for students is School Life, for others working in their profession. Daily Life is basically a synonym for everything normal, repetitive, and trivial happening to your average person.</description>

<name>school life</name>
<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<description>The main appeal of the show is the way the characters are portrayed and interact, focusing on dialogue, spending time together or getting to know each other. These anime are not "story-less" but story is secondary to character development and the characters themselves and what they experience.</description>

<name>walls of text</name>
<description>Walls of text refers to Japanese text that appears in large quantities within the anime itself. This text is most likely vital to the storyline and may come in the form of charts and diagrams or pieces of paper, notes or even thoughts that are only partially or entirely unspoken.
May also be taken as a fair warning to viewers unable to translate Japanese text on their own, suggesting that thorough subtitle support may be required as well as making use of the pause button on their media players so that all text can be read.
Normally, tags don`t refer to physical translations of text, subtitle appearances and karaoke styling added by 3rd parties. But those who seek to describe an anime that is heavy on SPOKEN dialogue (which may tend to create a large quantity of natural subtitling to read for those not fluent in the language being used) could consider this tag but may make clearer reference with the dialogue driven tag.</description>

<description>An inquisitive girl who joins the Classic Literature Club. Eru`s catchphrase is "I`m curious!" ("わたし, 気になります", watashi, ki ni narimasu!). Although she earns top grades in academics, she is often ditzy and relies on Oreki`s reasoning abilities often. She is an energetic girl that is well-versed in the town traditions and etiquette, having come from a lineage of wealthy farmers. Whenever a mystery is brought to her, she won`t be able to stop thinking about it until it is solved. She holds great admiration for Oreki, often praising him for his talent in solving mysteries. It is hinted that she harbors feelings for Oreki.

<description>The main protagonist of Hyouka, he is a rational boy who lives by "If I don`t have to do something, I won`t, but if I have to, I`ll do it quickly." He only joins the Classic Literature Club at the request of his older sister, Oreki Tomoe, to stop it from being dissolved. He says that he doesn`t like to waste energy, but if given a mystery to consider, he will see it through until it is solved with his brilliantly logical deductions. To him, Eru is "someone he can`t ignore," hinting that he may have feelings for her. At her urging, he soon finds himself more involved with high school life.

He calls Ibara Mayaka by her first name, which indicates the two are close. Later on, Satoshi reveals that he does have feelings for Mayaka, but doesn`t want to become "obsessed" with her. He begins to date Mayaka in the spring of their second year.
