<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="135541">Uhhh---- What I liked in this movie were the first several minutes when Gokuu and the crew were relaxing in a building, doing nice stuff together, featuring some comedy. That part felt really nice. As soon as the enemies appeared, the movie was boring and meh until the very end. Watch it for the first 10 minutes of fun~!</recommendation>

Preparing himself for battle Goku attempts to get a reading on the power level of his attackers. Coming up with nothing, he realizes that he is battling an android army. Goku leads the charge against the rival super androids in this feature length entry in the DRAGON BALL Z anime series.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>henshin</name>
<description>Japanese for "transformation" (metamorphosis or disguise).
A "henshin anime" is any anime, where the characters or their costumes transform, such as Sailor Moon. The henshin switches on the character`s special powers, and is frequently accompanied by a costume change. Often the change of clothing is the only outward indicator that the character has changed and yet nobody seems to notice the hero`s true self.
Most henshin heroes have a special item which they use to change into their heroic form. These items are usually activated by a command phrase (which is often in Engrish, for some reason), triggering a transformation sequence.</description>

<description>Jinzouningen 18 Gou (Android #18 in the English adaptations) is a fictional character who first appears in the Dragon Ball manga created by http://anidb.net/cr1902 [Toriyama Akira], followed by the shows http://anidb.net/a1530 [Dragon Ball Z] and http://anidb.net/a233 [Dragon Ball GT]. She is a mass murderer in http://anidb.net/ch13302 [Future Trunks]` timeline.
Originally a human, she and her brother were modified into cyborgs by http://anidb.net/ch18381 [Dr. Gero].
On a Q&amp;A with mangaka http://anidb.net/cr1902 [Toriyama Akira] published May 2nd, 2014 it was revealed that her human name was Lazuli.
After http://anidb.net/ch20915 [Cell] is defeated, http://anidb.net/ch11414 [Kuririn] uses the Dragon Balls to wish for her and her brother to be turned into humans; http://anidb.net/ch7015 [Shenron] is unable to perform this task because of the unfathomable differences in power between him and the duo, so he wishes instead for their self destruct devices to be removed. Kuririn pursues her and, at some point, they marry and have a daughter named http://anidb.net/ch30874 [Marron].
To clear up the heavily espoused misconception that she is a pure android and therefore could not have a child, Kuririn went on to explain to http://anidb.net/ch2103 [Son Gokuu] during the Tenkaichi Budoukai Saga that she was originally human but that Dr. Gero just "remodeled her a little bit."</description>

On a Q&amp;A with mangaka http://anidb.net/cr1902 [Toriyama Akira] published May 2nd, 2014 it was revealed that his human name was Lapis.
During the events of the Jinzouningen &amp; Cell arc, he and his sister drive around in a van with http://anidb.net/ch19618 [Jinzouningen 16 Gou], looking for http://anidb.net/ch2103 [Gokuu]. When they finally get to the Kame House, http://anidb.net/ch11416 [Piccolo] tells them Gokuu is not there and refuses to tell them where he went. Piccolo then challenges him to a battle and as they fight, Piccolo`s ki leads http://anidb.net/ch20915 [Cell] (who needs to absorb both jinzouningen to reach its perfect form) to the battlefield. Cell tells Jinzouningen 17 Gou to surrender so he can become a part of "greatness". He refuses and is then defeated during the ensuing battle.
After Cell is defeated, http://anidb.net/ch11414 [Kuririn] uses the Dragon Balls to wish for him and his sister to be turned into humans; http://anidb.net/ch7015 [Shenron] is unable to perform this task because of the unfathomable differences in power between him and the duo, so he wishes instead for their self destruct devices to be removed.</description>

<summary>One peaceful afternoon, the Son family and friends are spending the day out on the town shopping in West City. Meanwhile, two strangers enter the city and begin causing havoc, destroying nearly everything in their path. As the Son family is eating, the building they’re in is suddenly attacked, as it turns out the two are after Son Goku. When Goku sees that innocent people are being attacked in his name, he becomes furious. Trunks comes to Goku’s aid, and the two lead the artificial humans out of the city. As the battle is moved elsewhere, Goku and Gohan, now dressed in white tuxes, return and land in West City.
The two proceed to show clips and highlights from the preceding http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&amp;aid=231 [Dragon Ball] &amp; http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&amp;aid=1530 [Dragon Ball Z] movies. Goku of course doesn’t much like being all dressed up, and by the end he powers up to change back into his typical dōgi. Gohan tries to do the same, but isn’t powerful enough to get out of his tux. Goku says he’ll get there someday, and Gohan tells everyone to be sure to go see “http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&amp;aid=548 [Extreme Battle!! The Three Great Super Saiyans]” in theaters. Source - Kanzenshuu http://www.kanzenshuu.com/movie/dbz-summer-special/</summary>
