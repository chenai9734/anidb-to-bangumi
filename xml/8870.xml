<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="420432">really epic.  ending was soooo beautiful. if they just show little more about their lifes like what happen to them  but anyway...

a truly a master piece &amp;lt;3</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="456964">If you like music, especially jazz, you gonna be exited at this anime with no doubt. Kanno yoko who makes fantastic fabulous OSTs did her job very successfully. "One masterpiece of musical anime with grwoing teenagers point of view." Take a look. You are not gonna be disappointed.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="21092">Just by glancing through the entire series, and listening to the odd bit of Yoko Kanno`s Jazz, it`s apparent that this is yet another example of a great anime stemming from Josei material. A believable portrayal of slice of life and adolescence, albeit with relevant cliches; Sakamichi no Apollon is likely a worthy 6 hour diversion, if Yoko Kanno`s music isn`t a compelling enough reason to give this a chance.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="583710">I absolutely loved this anime. The characters I found were believable  and despite what other people said I liked the ending, wrapped it up nicely. I totally would recommend this anime. :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="73220">Even though I don`t really like jazz, this anime really caught my attention with the quality of animation, story telling and character development. The interaction between characters and their feelings are so well portrayed that you feel yourself drawn in. I really recommend watching this, beautiful story about love, friendship and music.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="531127">Definitely it`s one of the best anime serie I`ve watched. Great story, animation and characters and also it shows you how is the real life. You can`t waste the opportunity to see it! It remembers too anime like "Nodame Cantabile", "Nana" and "Hachimitsu to Clover". 
-------------
Esta seria no tiene desperdicio. Es uno de los mejores anime que existen con una historia bella y profunda, una animacion muy bien cuidada y unos personajes acorde a la trama. No debes perder la oportunidad de verlo, te encontraras con situaciones que podemos encontrar a diario en la vida.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="1057">Good, warm, heartfelt series... The animators put just about as much love into this series as the characters themselves feel. Great little watch and ended on a note that didn`t make you feel bad.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="414588">Coming of age, some similarities to Beck.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="326899">Let me start with some similarities with other masterpieces: Animation(even better than Cowboy Beebop, details, movement), Music (jazz, still Cowboy Beebop similarity as well as Nodame Cantabile sort of thing, not as good though), Heartwarming (remind me of Kimi ni Todoke).  This one will surely stay in mine memory for a long time. I want to encourage you to watch it no matter what ! Its a masterpiece and it should be given a try.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="459074">Just like what Sleepyowl said, it truly is a masterpiece and deserves to be watched all the way through, though I`d find it hard to believe you won`t finish it once started. Kids on the Slope is heartwarming and a must see!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="33393">This is one of the best shows that came out this season. The animation is gorgeous (beautiful subtle hints, you know when someone falls in love without some comic antic or ridiculous gesture the animators on this one need double thumbs up), the music is great, and the characters are very endearing! I just can`t find flaws with it yet... We`ll have to see how it ends but so far it`s amazing!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="333550">A masterpiece. Just watch it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="320398">Been missing jazz in anime?And a nice story and beautiful art to top that?Search no more people,this is it.Best anime for the season,probably one of the years` best!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="312729">I loved this to bits, it was amazing and the ending, well... you`ll have to watch and see! There was just something in this anime that made the characters and their relationships so believable; and the story instantly drew me in! It`s a must watch for fans of any genre in my opinion!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="544948">Wonderful drama with wonderful music and animation, anyone should enjoy this touching and heart felt story of friendship.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="61503">If you only going to watch one anime of 2012.
Make sure this is the serie you watch.

It is ONE of the best series so far this year in my eyes.

It really belongs in my top 10 list of best animes.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="301225">One of the most atmospheric anime series I`ve seen so far! Drama, comedy, romance. This show has it all and it does it in style. Think 1960`s Japan with loads of jazz music. A coming of age series that`s a must see for sure.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="75448">One word can describe this, MASTERPIECE</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="363469">This is one of those anime that I kept hearing people say "it is phenomenal." I left it on the back burner for awhile (could have sworn this only came out like 3 seasons ago), and now I totally regret doing that. This a truly beautiful anime, with a wonderful cast of characters, and a fantastic soundtrack (and I`m not even into jazz!). There are very few SoL anime that have stepped their game up to this level. Must see, 10/10.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="432445">This heartfelt drama is about how the love for music can bring people together in spite of differences. The story involves a love triangle of unrequited feelings, camaraderie strained, and the importance of family and friends. As one would expect from a jazz-themed show, the soundtrack is exquisite; the music plays a central role and is used masterfully to emote the feelings of the characters and invoke the movements of the plot. An excellent performance!</recommendation>

<name>lonely</name>
<description>Loneliness is an unpleasant feeling in which a person feels a strong sense of emptiness and solitude resulting from inadequate levels of social relationships. However, it is a subjective experience. Loneliness has also been described as social pain — a psychological mechanism meant to alert an individual of isolation and motivate her/him to seek social connections.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

<description>The antics of the protagonists do not take place in some exotic setting or time, but in everyday life. When not "at the job" this means getting up in the morning, making meals, house cleaning, going shopping or out to eat, visiting the bath house or spa, leisure activities in the spare time, etc. The time "on the job" for students is School Life, for others working in their profession. Daily Life is basically a synonym for everything normal, repetitive, and trivial happening to your average person.</description>

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<description>Religion is a collection of belief systems, cultural systems, and worldviews that relate humanity to spirituality and, sometimes, to moral values. Many religions have narratives, symbols, traditions and sacred histories that are intended to give meaning to life or to explain the origin of life or the universe. They tend to derive morality, ethics, religious laws or a preferred lifestyle from their ideas about the cosmos and human nature.</description>

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<description>In the strict sense the Coming of age describes a young person`s transition from adolescence to adulthood. In anime the term is used in a more general sense where the protagonists have to face a challenge, make an important decision in their life, take on responsibility, or learn a lesson, and by overcoming these obstacles they reach a higher level of maturity.</description>

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

<name>important haircut</name>
<description>When a character cuts off his or her hair, it often symbolizes a rite of passage or bout of character growth. A princess striking out on an adventure, or a new recruit at boot camp, for instance. Hair is something that takes time and effort to grow, so parting with it voluntarily can be a powerful act.
This is particularly a big deal when women get haircuts. Yet in fiction, even an accidental hair slicing can leave a character with a surprisingly even cut.
In many religions (Western Christianity, Ancient Egyptian religion, and others) priests and/or monks cut/shave their hair. Roman Catholic nuns also tend to cut and mantain their hair short under their veils when they enter the nunneries. The cutting of one`s own hair is also a part of Buddhist mythology, specifically something done by Siddhartha himself early on in his path to enlightenment, so anime examples might draw from this as an allusion. There are also some cultures, including Native American and many Asians, where a person would cut his or her hair as an act of grief, disgrace, or even rebellion. In the Confucian tradition, hair (like the rest of your body) is considered a gift from your parents and may not be damaged without a very good reason. Furthermore, prisoners and psychiatric patients commonly have their heads shaved, often to prevent the spread of lice, but sometimes also as a demeaning measure.

<description>noitaminA (ノイタミナ) – Animation written backwards – is a Fuji Television programming block, devoted to anime, broadcast each Thursday night from 00:45 to 1:15. It was launched with the intention of expanding the target audience beyond the typical young male demographic.
The timeslot was expanded from half an hour to a full hour in 2010, and now airs Thursday nights from 00:45 to 1:45.
noitaminA aired its first non-anime series in 2010, with the premiere of the live-action adaptation of Moyashimon. On April 15, 2010, Fuji TV and FUNimation announced an agreement that allows FUNimation to simulcast series from the noitaminA block in North America within an hour of their airing in Japan.</description>

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>
