<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="644224">So I just watched Season 1, Season 2 and the movie in the last weeks.

I like all characters and stories from Season 1, unfortunately Season 2 felt really rushed with only 11 episodes and there were time I thought the plot was really shallow/easy/inconsistent (in regards to Season 1 overall), I wish they had made at least 20 episodes for Season 2 so the story and the characters (both old and new) had a chance to develop further...

The movie was cool, but I wish they had kept to Japanese language only.

The art, animation, character design and OST are all amazing for both Series and Movie. 

Overall and with or without its flaws, Psycho-Pass was quiet refreshing (and very worth watching/re-watching)   for a Cyberpunk/Science Fiction story and I feel sad that so little Series of it`s genre are created nowadays</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="536010">Solid sequel, continues many of the conventions of the previous sequel but with a new antagonist.

However,  this series lacks the strength of a strong main cast and the pacing the previous season had (slow build up despite the shorter length of the series) It`s climax does pay off in the end.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="388517">cool sequel to an awesome cyber-punk show</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="744069">A disappointing season. Talking about philosophy and politics in animations is never a good idea, while the second season puts the main focus on such things, and gives out a strange result. In contrast, season one put the main focus on character building and relationships, thus the story is quite entertaining to watch. This season just kills many good characters it can kill and leaves many boring characters alive for next season. That is why it gets a 6 points compared to the first season of 8 points. Regardless of the first season, it will get at most a rating of 7.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="588927">Untortunately it lacks the refinement and sublime writing of the first season. The new characters lack the honest human elements that made the first season so convincingly authentic and the plot often feels forced and artificial. 22 episodes would probably have been a much more suitable format to develop everything the series has to offer. 
Still the meta-plot is developed in reasonable way and all in all it is still a very enjoyable watch! Don`t miss out on it, if you liked the first season!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="317942">Another interesting season with a different criminal and different issue for the Sibyl system to solve. Overall it asks some interesting questions and comes to an interesting conclusion although questions remain. If you enjoyed the first season you should definitely watch this one too.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="510860">Unfortunately not as good as the first season as far as the story and flow of the anime goes- it kinds of get convoluted towards the end with different twists that it gets a little complicated. Still recommended if your looking for action in a dark setting, the music is awesome too!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="435">I think it beats the first season by far.
While the main antagonist is lacking human characteristics, he is perfect for questioning the dystopian society pictured in this show.
The main hero (Akane) is better than ever, as well.
The plot is short but well-performed with some intelligent viewpoints what an ideal society should and shouldn`t be to think about.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="733904">Watch it, that`s all I can say.</recommendation>

<name>detective</name>
<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>noitaminA (ノイタミナ) – Animation written backwards – is a Fuji Television programming block, devoted to anime, broadcast each Thursday night from 00:45 to 1:15. It was launched with the intention of expanding the target audience beyond the typical young male demographic.
The timeslot was expanded from half an hour to a full hour in 2010, and now airs Thursday nights from 00:45 to 1:45.
noitaminA aired its first non-anime series in 2010, with the premiere of the live-action adaptation of Moyashimon. On April 15, 2010, Fuji TV and FUNimation announced an agreement that allows FUNimation to simulcast series from the noitaminA block in North America within an hour of their airing in Japan.</description>

<name>gore</name>
<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<description>Rebellion, uprising, or insurrection is a refusal of obedience or order. It may, therefore, be seen as encompassing a range of behaviors aimed at destroying or taking over the position of an established authority such as a government, governor, president, political leader, financial institution, or person in charge. On the one hand the forms of behaviour can include non-violent methods such as the (overlapping but not quite identical) phenomena of civil disobedience, civil resistance and nonviolent resistance. On the other hand it may encompass violent campaigns. Those who participate in rebellions, especially if they are armed rebellions, are known as "rebels".&#13;

<description>The title of Philip K. Dick`s SF novel (movie: Blade Runner). 
The phrase implies a set of existential questions: Do artificial beings (e.g. Replicants, Bioroids, or other AI constructs) dream, feel, or have a soul? If memories can be implanted, what makes real memories real? By contrast — what makes humans human? What is reality? 
These are central themes e.g. in all of the Ghost in the Shell and Appleseed series / movies.</description>

<description>Dominator is the handgun that enforcement officers point at a suspect to instantly measure the "crime factor" of the individual. If the crime factor is above a certain limit, the gun will automatically fire. If the "crime factor" is below that limit, a safety device will be activated to prevent the user from pulling the gun`s trigger.

<description>Ginoza Nobuchika is an Enforcer with http://anidb.net/ch76608 [Public Safety Division 1] at the http://anidb.net/ch76607 [Public Safety Bureau].
He was demoted to Enforcer after his Crime Coefficient rose above regulation levels to 140, after the death of his father http://anidb.net/ch48543 [Masaoka Tomomi] at the hands of http://anidb.net/ch48756 [Makishima Shougo]. As part of the incident, Ginoza lost his left arm and gained a prosthetic, much like his father. Ginoza`s personality and outlook on life also drastically changed. Further, he no longer wears glasses; when http://anidb.net/ch48307 [Tsunemori Akane] asks if he actually needed prescription glasses, Ginoza replied that he wore glasses as he did not like the shape of his face, but he no longer cares about this aspect of his appearance.</description>
