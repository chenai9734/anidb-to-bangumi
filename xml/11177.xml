<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="445831">From all the light novel-sci fi-harem-animes, it`s one of the better ones. Nice animation, likeable characters and lots of actions. The pacing is good, not too slow or too fast, enough plots and not too much harem. With both seasons together it has a nice length too.</recommendation>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>violent retribution for accidental infringement</name>
<description>A comedy / slapstick element often found in Ecchi anime: The hilarity derives from spontaneous embarrassment, overreaction of the "victim" (girl), immediate retribution for a seemingly inappropriate act, and a sense of pity with the supposed "aggressor" (boy).
Typically a boy will - through no fault of his own - stumble into a girl, thus invading her personal space. In the process the boy may e.g. pull down her skirt, grab the girl`s breasts, or accidentally kiss her. Any level-headed girl would see the accident just for what it is. Not so the girl with an overly developed sense of modesty, and a thing for violence. She - often a tsundere - will clobber the boy with excessive brutality.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<summary>Julis goes to an abandoned building to meet up with the perpetrator of the attacks on the students, who turns out to be Silas Norman, one of Lester`s flunkies. He gave himself away when he tried to stop Lester the day before by letting slip that he knew of the aborted duel between Julis and Saya, which was not publicly reported. Lester arrives, and confronts Silas, who attacks, sending his puppets to do his fighting for him. He has a large number of powerful puppets and Lester is badly beaten, and Julis is injured as she realises that only Allekant has the technological ability to make such puppets.
Ayato arrives just in time and by using Ser Veresta he manages to destroy the puppets permanently, and realises that Silas`s strategy involves using his puppets like chess pieces. In that way he manages to destroy all the puppets and defeat Silas. Just as he has finished chains materialise and lock about him and he realises that his sister had done something that sealed away part of his power so he can only use it at its fullest for at most five minutes.
Later, Silas has come to after his defeat and is confronted by Claudia, who injures him badly so he can be interrogated. She plans to use the incident to blackmail Allekant into making a deal with Seidoukan.</summary>

<summary>After obtaining Ser Veresta, Claudia calls Ayato to her room, and while rather unsubtly trying to seduce him explains how several students who were supposed to be participating in the Phoenix Festa were unaccountably injured, evidently attacked in the same way that Julis was attacked. The prime suspects include Lester, and they suspect that the next one to be attacked would be Julis. Claudia thus asks Ayato to watch over Julis and help protect her.
The next day Ayato has sort of a date with Julis who shows him around the city. While they are having lunch Lester shows up and tries to challenge Julis yet again, and Ayato points out that his behaviour towards her has made him a suspect, which makes him very angry, but his flunkies manage to calm him down. On their way back they see a group of punks seemingly having a brawl at a park, but this is a ruse that allows them to surround Julis and Ayato, but they make short work of the punks. One punk explains how someone had hired them to rough them up a little, and he sees the man who hired them in the trees. Julis chases after him, with Ayato right behind, but there are several attackers and they manage to damage Ayato`s clothes before escaping.
When they return to the dorms Julis mends Ayato`s clothes and explains how despite being a princess she befriended the children in an orphanage in her country, and how she is fighting in Asterisk to obtain the money which they badly need and how the handkerchief Ayato recovered was a keepsake of theirs.
The following day Julis receives a letter which makes her leave school without explanation before anyone can stop her. Claudia urges Ayato to chase her as she is evidently walking into a trap.</summary>

<summary>Ayato interjects himself into the brewing confrontation between Lester MacPhail and Julis, and with Eishirou`s help manages to prevent the situation from escalating. Eishirou leaves suddenly for an errand so Ayato asks Julis how to get to the boys` dormitories, and asks her to show her around campus the following day as a favour. She agrees reluctantly remembering how he had saved her life.
The next day Ayato sees an that an old friend, Sasamiya Saya, is also in his class. She too offers to show him around campus, and Claudia briefly comes by to give him the forms needed to apply for use of a weapon. He settles the dispute between Saya and Julis by saying they can both show him around. Saya it turns out is almost as ignorant of the campus as Ayato, and when the tour is done, he goes off to buy them drinks. Julis is about to challenge Saya to a duel after Saya says that Julis is nowhere near as strong as Ayato, but before they can start they are attacked by the mysterious assassins who interfered with Julis`s duel with Ayato the day before. The assassins are driven off but no trace of them is found by campus security.
Ayato goes to the weapon compatibility test and sees that Lester is also trying to apply, and he too wants to take the sword Ser Veresta, just as Ayato does. Lester tests himself against it but gets a low compatibility score, that only gets lower as he attempts to dominate it, until his score becomes negative and it attacks. Ayato however is able to somehow control Ser Veresta and receives a good compatibility score with it.</summary>

<summary>Amagiri Ayato has just transferred into Seidoukan Academy on Asterisk. While he is walking along the school grounds he sees a handkerchief falling from the window of a dormitory building. He picks it up and jumps up to the window intending to return it, and sees a girl getting dressed. While the handkerchief is precious to her and she appreciates his returning it she is angry that he has seen her in such a state and challenges him to a duel. He proves to be remarkably skilled, and he saves her when they are mysteriously attacked from an unexpected quarter. The student council president Claudia Enfield puts a stop to the duel, saying it is invalid because Ayato has not yet completed all the paperwork for his transfer.
He learns from Claudia a bit about the Academy and about his opponent, Julis-Alexia von Riessfeld who is a princess from a small European country. He also asks about his elder sister, Amagiri Haruka, who mysteriously disappeared but seems to have garbled records in the Academy. He attends class and finds that Julis is also in the same class and she expresses her dislike for him, but he is befriended by his classmate Yabuki Eishirou. During lunchtime, they see Julis being harassed by Lester MacPhail, who is trying to challenge her to another duel despite having lost to her three times.</summary>
