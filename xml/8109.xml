<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="81564">"Watchable" for fans but not "Enjoyable".  I`m a fan of JC Staff and Rie, and this anime is just a cluster of failed attempts at story, plot and character development.  Stereotypes are all it carries.  Closet to Zero No Tsukaima with none of the charm of any anime Rie has done with this type of loli tsundere.

I agree with others, plenty of good to decent action, series opens with good potential detective story (I was hooked) and action that builds to an airplane scene and after that episode it crumbles.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="432674">I agree with farce, the book was far more charming. And they left some vital information that would help understand our characters, and other materials in the book which i thought would look awesome if shown.

Nevertheless, the show is average. Harem BANZAI!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="484892">Hidan no Aria took anime in a direction where it had not gone before.  There are good fighting scenes in this anime and great plot continuity, but what makes this anime is the character interactions.  There are a lot of hilarious ecchi, or dare I say borderline hentai moments between Kenji and the main girls, especially Riko.  If you are a fan of Action or Risque animes, then this is for you.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="443903">I don`t know why this show is low rated, it`s pretty good, animes with pro gunslingers aren`t that common anymore which is sad..
lolies with guns, what do you want more then that? Watch it!</recommendation>

<description>* Based on http://anidb.net/cr24125 [Akamatsu Chuugaku]`s light novel series.
Tokyo Butei High School is a special school where armed detectives, also known as Butei, are trained and educated. http://anidb.net/ch25345 [Tooyama Kinji] is a sophomore student, who can go into Hysteria Mode when "stimulated" — affecting his mental state (ultra-fast reflexes, protection complex) and manner of speech. He tries to hide this genetically inherited ability from others in order to live a peaceful life. But when he becomes the victim of a bombing incident, by a Butei Killer copycat, his quiet days are over with the fateful encounter with http://anidb.net/ch25344 [Kanzaki H. Aria] — the Butei High "Assault" department elite.</description>

<name>loli</name>
<description>Lolita (often also just abbreviated to loli) refers originally to a novel by Vladimir Nabokov. The book is internationally famous for its controversial subject: the narrator and protagonist, middle aged Humbert Humbert, becomes obsessed and sexually involved with a 12-year-old girl named Dolores Haze.
Nowadays the name "Lolita" describes a sexually precocious young girl.
Related to this is http://anidb.net/t2415 [lolicon], the Japanese abbreviation of the English phrase "Lolita Complex". Sometimes written as "roricon" or "rorikon" due to the inexact mapping between Japanese and English phonemes. This is the term used to describe the fetish/fascination some mature people have for underage girls. There is an entire industry in Japan devoted to providing legal but schoolgirl-themed pornography, taking advantage of the cute childlike appearance some Japanese women maintain well into their twenties.
Because the characters in anime are often young by convention, many fans think that a character can only be Lolicon if she is twelve or younger. Exceptions are granted if the other character in the relationship is a lot older.
One particular device used to skirt the boundaries of taste and legality is the exotic being (alien, creature of magic, robot or the like) which takes the form of an underage human girl, but is in fact for all other practical purposes an adult.
Another reason why lolicon is fetishized by people may be because some of them just view it as a substitute for their fetish for flat-chested, but otherwise well-developed, women.

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>large breasts</name>
<description>Large breasts are breasts a fair notch larger than average, as found in some adolescent girls or fully grown women; however, as anime has no upper limit to breast size, the definition applies somewhat differently. To be considered large, breasts in anime must be bigger than real-life natural ones or natural-seeming fake ones, to the point they`d appear weirdly or even abnormally large in real-life females. On the high end of the spectrum, breasts that are as big as the character`s head or possibly a bit bigger are still considered large; however, breasts that take at least as much space as the rest of the chest or the abdomen, or that are almost as big but have an absurdly unnatural shape, are the less common http://anidb.net/t1774 [gigantic breasts] instead.</description>

<name>violent retribution for accidental infringement</name>
<description>A comedy / slapstick element often found in Ecchi anime: The hilarity derives from spontaneous embarrassment, overreaction of the "victim" (girl), immediate retribution for a seemingly inappropriate act, and a sense of pity with the supposed "aggressor" (boy).
Typically a boy will - through no fault of his own - stumble into a girl, thus invading her personal space. In the process the boy may e.g. pull down her skirt, grab the girl`s breasts, or accidentally kiss her. Any level-headed girl would see the accident just for what it is. Not so the girl with an overly developed sense of modesty, and a thing for violence. She - often a tsundere - will clobber the boy with excessive brutality.</description>

<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

<description>The titular character and the main female protagonist of the series is a transfer student of Butei High School. An "Assault" department elite rank S (The highest rank), she wishes to recruit Kinji after their encounter. She can wield two guns and two swords at the same time, earning the title of a "Quadra". Her weapons of choice are two Colt Government Model semi-automatic pistols, and two undersized Japanese swords known as Kodachi. The H in the middle name stands for "Holmes" as she is a descendant of Sherlock Holmes himself, and her full name is Aria Holmes Kanzaki IV. She is very short for her age and what is causing her stunted growth is a special HihiIrokane bullet embedded in her back. Irokane is a special element that can turn a normal human into a super power user. HihiIrokane is red Irokane that requires a childish nature and prideful personality to be able to use. Although Kinji learned about the special properties of the bullet and potential powers it gives from Holmes, Aria seems largely unaware of anything unusual about the bullet or herself. Just that some stranger shot her for an unknown reason and the bullet can`t be removed safely. As a side effect of the bullet lodged within her eye color and hair color, which were originally flaxen with sapphire blue eyes changed to a pinkish strawberry blonde and ruby colored eyes. Her mother is Japanese and her father is half English half Japanese. Her grandmother is a member of the British Royal Family, having received the title of a "dame". She also starts to have feelings for Kinji after they kissed on episode 5, and gets jealous when other girls approach Kinji.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The main male protagonist of the series and a student at Butei High School. He was ranked Level E (lowest combat rank) due to missing the third term`s final examination. However, when he is sexually aroused, he enters a state known as "Hysteria Mode" in which his cognitive and physical abilities increase to around thirty times his normal state, which allows him to perform feats of near-superhuman strength and skill, such as accurately shooting up the muzzle of an enemy gun, swinging his knife at supersonic speeds, and accurately shooting enemy bullets out of the air. Hysteria Mode is a genetic trait that all members of the Tooyama family possess, and is stated to be an extremely highly evolved version of the natural male instinct to protect women. As such, when in Hysteria Mode, Kinji`s major weakness is the fact that he cannot directly harm women, though he is still able to fight and restrain them without directly hurting them. In addition to this, Hysteria Mode also causes Kinji to develop a suave and seductive attitude towards women, which makes him very attractive to them while in Hysteria Mode. He is currently enrolled in the Inquesta department, though in the past, he was a prodigy (being ranked Level S) of the Assault department, the most dangerous department in Butei High. He starts to respect and have romantic feelings for Aria. He proves his feelings for Aria by kissing her on the lips on episode 5, though this is done to calm her down. Currently, his feelings for Aria are so strong that even the slightest bit of sexual/romantic involvement with Aria will activate his Hysteria Mode.
His gun of choice is a Beretta 92F (which was illegally modified to fire a three-round burst; he refers to it as the Beretta Kinji Model). He also wields a butterfly knife.

<description>Female student of Butei High School, friend of Kinji. She`s enrolled in the Inquesta department; although often considered the biggest idiot in Kinji`s class, this is a deliberate facade which breaks down when she is forced into dangerous circumstances. She has a talent for intelligence assessment and, at Butei High, gossip. She enjoys customizing her uniform in an Elegant Gothic Lolita style. She wields two Walther P99s and two knives. Like Aria, she earned the title of a "Quadra".
Riko is revealed as a descendant of Arsène Lupin. Her real name is Riko Mine Lupin IV. Riko also reveals that she was the Butei Killer. She appears to have an inferiority complex towards the first Lupin and wanted to overcome him. Her plan was to make Aria and Kinji become a partner so it would create the same battle situation where Sherlock has Watson as a partner before. Defeating both of them would mean she would overcome her ancestor since Sherlock Holmes and Arsene Lupin fought 100 years ago and neither side came out on top. Due to being locked in a cell at very young age after both of her parents died, and was constantly used as an experimental tool by Toru; and on top of that, due to Toru`s saying that she is worthless and does not inherit any of the past Lupins` abilities and that her only existence is that she could produce Lupin the V, she despises being referred to by her generation`s number. At that time, she was also given very little food and muddy water.
It was also revealed that there is in fact a reason for Riko`s complex of wanting to surpass the original Lupin, Riko was held captive by Vlad the Bad and was recently `let go`, under certain circumstances, these were that Riko would have to prove to surpass the original Lupin causing her to have an obsession in the defeat of Sherlock Holmes the 4th.
She has feelings for Kinji, but these feelings are considered unhealthy because she constantly attempts to seduce Kinji. Even so, she proves them by sharing a kiss with him on episode 11.
After defeating Vlad with the assist of Kinji and Aria, she helps Aria justify that Kanae Kanzaki (Aria`s mother) is not the Butei Killer, and that Vlad is the one who is truly behind all of the murders.
Riko and Aria share several traits: small height, Quadra status, twin-tailed hair and representation of the fourth generation of their ancestral family, and lastly, both are romantically interested in Kinji.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The Snipe department`s ace, Butei rank S. No family name. She`s habitually taciturn, impassive and indifferent in fashion. Kinji later finds out that this, along with her hair color, was to due to the influence of large quantities of RiriIrokane in her birthplace. RiriIrokane is Azure Irokane and can nullify other powers in a state of calm. However, according to a Hotogi Historical Record it `hates` human hearts and the princesses of Ulus (of which Reki is part of) revere and offer their `hearts` to it. She`s always seen wearing headphones. Her signature quote is "I am a single bullet. It has no heart. Therefore, it does not think. It just flies straight towards its target", which she always say before she shoots her target. She can shoot anything without missing her target within a 2km radius. Her personal weapon is a Dragunov sniper rifle with an attachable bayonet. She apparently listens to the sound of wind from her homeland (somewhere between Northern Mongolia and Siberia) with her headphones, which are Sennheiser PMX990.
She plays a minor role in the series, usually providing covering fire to Aria and Kinji when they are fighting at close range or saving them during times of trouble.
Apparently before coming to Butei High, Reki was also doing "unrecorded" jobs in Russia and China due to her Butei license. In other words, she worked as a "Sweeper", killing her targets.

<description>A bright, handsome and popular guy. Enrolled in Assault, and in the same class as Kinji. His Butei level is A. Even though there are different aspects involved in an A ranking, his integration capacity is high. Barehanded, dagger handling or shooting aspects can all be relied on. The reliability of his gun is very high, a Mk. 23 MODO with an installed laser aiming lens. He is also a rare polite person in Butei High. Even though he is very popular with girls, he never had a girlfriend before.
He is Kinji and Mutou`s close friend. In past, back in Kinji`s Assault days, he was often his teammate. Kinji considers him a good friend and someone to rely on, an example of a polite and elegant student.

<description>The Logi`s ace with a 190cm height and pointy hair. Kinji considers him as a transportation geek. This is all due to his knowledge about all kinds of vehicles may it be on land, sea or air. He is a skilled driver that can operate anything from a car to a nuclear submarine. His personal weapon is a Colt Python Revolver that uses .357 magnum bullet and only chose it for the sake of easy maintenance. Despite the astounding firepower, the gun`s loading capacity is small, the accuracy is horrible and it cannot equip a suppressor, so normally, no Butei would use it.
Goki has feelings for Shirayuki; this is evidenced that he feels guilty for her when he tries to peek at the other girls in the hot springs of the OVA. Despite that, he is also a shameless pervert. He peeks at the girls in the girls` changing room locker, and tries to peek at the girls in the hot springs by climbing over the wall, claiming that `It`s a man`s world!`

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Jeanne d`Arc XXX (also known as Durandal or Diamond Dust Witch) is an ice ability user from I.U. (a criminal organization). She targets Shirayuki in an attempt to kidnap her and force her to join I.U. She is successfully captured via the combined efforts of Aria, Kinji and Shirayuki during the season of Adseard. As one of the conditions of her plea bargain, she was forced to stay in Butei High as a 2nd year international student from Paris enrolled in the Informa department. As a reliable Informa student, Kinji requests her aid whenever he needs a supply of knowledge about a particular case he is involved at. Jeanne and Riko get along with each other very well.
She is one of the few people that knows Kinji`s secret. Her personality is serious and cool. Her first comment about Butei High`s skirt is: "Unmarried girls shouldn`t openly reveal their legs like this!". However, that notion was pretty much shattered because of Riko`s strong influence on her, and she has grown a habit of secretly collecting maid dresses, Lolita fashion and other cute dresses. Due to astigmatism she usually wears contacts to see clearly, but carries a pair of glasses as backup or for reading.
Although Jeanne is quite extraordinary in terms of fighting skills, planning, investigating, beauty and ability, her drawing skills are unimpressive, in fact an elementary school student can draw much better than her. Despite her strength, she alleges that she is the weakest out of all the members of I.U. Preferred weapon is the Durandal. However, after Shirayuki broke part of it off she had to adjust to the shorter blade. Melting down the whole blade and reforging it as a single piece again is inadvisable as that would severely weaken the integrity of the metal making it much easier to break. Or in simple terms, the weakness of the break would be spread to the entire sword.

<summary>Kinji is walking down the street, reminiscing about the fate of his brother, who had also been a Butei, who was killed in a maritime hijacking incident that he later learns was also the work of the Butei Killer. He sees Aria in the street and follows her, but she catches him, and tells him to come with him. She goes to a police station where her mother is being held, suspected as the Butei Killer. She urges Aria to find a good partner as she cannot handle the true Butei Killer alone. Kinji later hears that Aria is leaving Japan on a chartered flight to London. He goes to a karaoke bar with Riko, who proceeds to seduce him, activating his Hysteria Mode briefly, and he deduces from what she tells him that Aria is in danger. He rushes to the airport, boards the plane, and as he expected the plane is hijacked by the Butei Killer, who turns out to be none other than Riko herself. She reveals that she is the fourth lineal descendant of Arsène Lupin, the famed master thief, just as Aria is the fourth descendant of his arch-nemesis Sherlock Holmes, and that she staged all of the Butei Killer incidents and tried to bring Kinji and Aria together, so that she could prove that she was better than her famous ancestor. Aria and Riko fight, but Riko manages to shoot Aria in the chest.</summary>

<summary>Riko gives Kinji an arcade ticket so he goes to the arcade for a little relaxation. He plays the UFO catcher and manages to get two stuffed toys for Aria. The next day, Kinji once again misses the bus to school, but the Butei Killer has struck once again, and planted bombs in the bus, set to explode if the bus slows down below a certain point. This becomes Kinji`s first mission with Aria. They manage to destroy an remotely-operated car that is shooting the bus with a mounted gun, and board the bus, trying to find and defuse the bomb. Aria sees the bomb planted on the bus chassis, but is unable to reach it. Kinji tries to find the sensors that the Killer is using to know what is going on, but a second car appears and shoots at them, and would have killed him if Aria did not intervene. She is wounded as a result. The sniper Reki, on a helicopter, manages to shoot the bomb off the bus. Aria is disappointed with Kinji`s performance in the mission and decides that he isn`t the partner for her.</summary>

<summary>Kinji takes Aria, unconscious from the shot, and treats her so that she revives. He undoes her blouse and kisses her; his arousal at this activates his Hysteria Mode. When Riko gets to them he is prepared, and they manage to chase her off. The plane lurches as this happens, making them realise that it probably has no pilot, so Aria, who knows how to fly planes, goes to the cockpit, while Kinji goes after Riko. He finds her as she is preparing to make her getaway, mysteriously mentioning an organisation called EU whom she works for, and implying they have his brother. She manages to escape, and Aria and Kinji must get the plane to land safely, damaged as it is by Riko`s compatriots, who have fired missiles on it just as she escaped. They manage this despite the JSDF threatening to shoot the plane down if they disobey their instructions to essentially crash the plane into the sea.
Afterwards, Aria realises she really needs a partner and there could be no other partner for her but Kinji. At the last minute Kinji changes his mind and chases after her.</summary>

Aria and Kinji find themselves in an impossible position as their bullets fail to harm Vlad, as they do not know where his fourth weak spot is. Kinji attempts to get Riko away before returning to the battle, and she tells him that she believes his fourth weak spot is in his chest. They try to do this, but it does not work, and Kinji`s Hysteria Mode wears off, but not before he notices something important. He nearly falls off the building in Vlad`s counter-attack, but Riko manages to save him using her parachute-dress, and they circle around and pick up Aria. Between them they have four guns with one shot each. Kinji lands with his face on Aria`s chest and this restores his Hysteria Mode, and they attack Vlad one last time. Kinji noticed how Vlad attempted to protect his mouth the last time they shot at him, and he correctly deduced that was where his fourth weak spot was, and that way they manage to kill him.
Afterwards, Riko makes her escape, but keeps her promise to testify on Aria`s mother`s behalf.</summary>

At the villa, they see the popular teacher Sayonaki, who is supposedly staying at the house doing his research with the owner`s permission.
They remain at the villa for two weeks, eventually discovering the precise location of Riko`s rosary which is under heavy security, and Sayonaki`s behaviour seems very suspicious. At the end of the two weeks Riko has them move, with Aria distracting Sayonaki as Kinji goes down into the underground storage room to take the rosary. Riko cuts Aria off from their radio link and speaks to him seductively in Aria`s voice, which activates his Hysteria Mode, and that allows him to steal the rosary just before Aria and Sayonaki return. After they deliver the rosary back to Riko, she double-crosses them, saying that she used them to retrieve it and now will defeat them both.</summary>

Kinji is made to go to one of the infirmaries but on the way he sees Jeanne playing the piano. She was evidently also given a plea bargain and explains about how Vlad is some sort of inhuman monster who has lived for centuries, and that both her ancestors and Riko`s planned his overthrow over a century ago and failed, and how Riko wants to be free of Vlad after having suffered under his heel most of her life.
Kinji arrives at the infirmary right on time and a group of female students has been made to take a physical exam, so he hides in a locker where Mutou has already positioned himself to spy on the girls. The girls include Reki, Aria, and Riko and it is evident to Kinji that her plan was to train him in achieving Hysteria Mode. It is soon obvious that Aria is able to most easily excite Hysteria Mode in him for some reason. The two boys are exposed just as a white wolf attacks them under Vlad`s orders, but Kinji and Reki manage to subdue the wolf after chasing it through the school.</summary>

Riko tells them that she plans to steal back her treasure from Vlad, the second in command of the E.U., and wants their help doing it. Aria and Kinji reluctantly agree.
Shirayuki sees Kinji and Riko walking together in the rain and takes exception to her, and they have a brief fight before Riko leaves.

Kinji tells Aria to chase Durandal up to the higher level since she cannot swim, while he tries to free Shirayuki. Kinji is unable to pick all the locks before the water level rises above Shirayuki`s head, so he activates Hysteria Mode by kissing her, and he is able to pick the locks very quickly. Shirayuki is washed to the upper level ahead of him, and he sees her there. He asks her how her lips are, just as Aria arrives, and when this fails to fluster her he realises that "Shirayuki" is an impostor. The real Shirayuki appears and fights Durandal, whose true identity is Jeanne d`Arc XXX. By working together they manage to defeat Jeanne.</summary>

He realises this almost too late, when he finds her about to give herself up to Durandal, who also seems to be working for EU, the same mysterious organisation Riko works for.

She makes several attempts to kill Aria later as well, seeing her as a thieving cat who has stolen Kinji from her. Kinji explains how Shirayuki is a Butei with supernatural powers that come from her training as a shrine maiden. They later learn that she is being targeted by someone called `Durandal`, who seems to have been responsible for some of the crimes Aria`s mother was accused of. They volunteer to be Shirayuki`s bodyguards. Life with Aria and Shirayuki is less than peaceful.</summary>
