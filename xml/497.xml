<description>In 2047 A.D. (one year after the confrontation with Protodeviln) we join Basara, who has left the rock band "Fire Bomber".
After having roamed around the Galaxy, Basara reaches a peripheral planet "Zora".
Planet Zora is a unique planet in the Galaxy, where galaxy whales are swimming about. Galaxy whales can be used as a power source to make a space ship fly at super high speed.
Basara gets involved in the fight between poachers of galaxy whales, which can be sold at high prices on the black market, and anti-poacher patrols (Liza). Wounded in the fight, Basara is saved by a girl named Elma. He comes under the care of Elma and his father, Graham, a whale fisherman.
In this OVA, you will enjoy new pieces of music of Basara Nekki and fascinating Valkyries. You will also meet a slightly grown-up Mylene in the story.</description>

Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>space opera</name>
<description>Space opera is a sub-genre of fiction that emphasizes romantic adventures in space. Space opera generally involves large-scale conflicts between opponents with powerful abilities and technology. The genre will often be melodramatic, sometimes playing music that can be nothing short of awesome. Warfare and a battle of wits are usually less emphasized, preferring romance (with exceptions, e.g. Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu). Some space operas tend to be formulaic and sometimes even prosaic, often employing very simple devices and somewhat obvious strategies. An example of this would be the infamous laws of physics in the Macross universe, in which the main male lead will hardly ever get hit in battle.</description>

<description>Super Robot Wars is a series of tactical role-playing video games produced by Banpresto. The main feature of the franchise is having a story that crosses over several popular mecha anime, manga and video games, allowing characters and mecha from different titles to team up or battle one another. Due to the nature of crossover games and licensing involved, only a few games have been released outside Japan, and in English; early English-language games only feature Banpresto`s original characters and mecha, and a flagship installment were to never be released until 2016, with the English release of Super Robot Wars V in Southeast Asian countries. The franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2016.

<description>The Uraga Class Escort Battle Carrier is the next generation stealth carrier built to replace the Guantánamo Class Stealth Carriers. The Uraga Class, built with weaponry, armor and maneuverability comparable to a cruiser, is often used as the flagship of small fleets. At 550 meters long, the Uraga Class ships are much larger conventional spacecraft but still significantly smaller than the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] or the later New Macross Class ships. The Uraga is built with a stealth composition and features a dual deck launching system for variable fighters; one deck running the latter dorsal two-thirds of the ship and an internal deck underneath with a launching deck in the forward third. This efficient deck design allows rapid deployment of multiple craft simultaneously and has become common on many UN Spacy carrier vessels.
These ships are rare among colonization fleets due to their high costs compared to the http://anidb.net/ch48791 [ARMD] carriers but the UNG remains committed to replacing the older http://anidb.net/ch48791 [ARMD] carriers one by one with Uraga Class vessels. As more Uraga Class Escort Battle Carriers are built, they are poised to become the mainstay combat and carrier ship for the UN Spacy. Many Uraga Class vessels are part of Earth`s defense fleet in 2040 and are found serving as command ships for large groups of Guantánamo Class Stealth Carriers and Stealth Frigates. Several Uraga Class Escort Battle Carriers are also in active service with the 37th Long-Distance Colonization Fleet, serving as defensive stations docked to unarmed core ships such as the Riviera and Hollywood.

<name>VF-17D Nightmare</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>In the mid 2020`s the U.N.G. was already invested in the development of the VF-11 Thunderbolt, but motivation was high for the continuing innovation of new OverTechnology applications in the hopes of building even better variable fighter craft. Ever a company known for pushing the envelope, General Galaxy was contracted by the U.N.G. to build a different type of variable mecha and thus began the development of the VF-17 Nightmare in 2026. While the VF-11 took first flight after only six years of design, the complicated and exacting research of the VF-17 didn`t produce a viable craft until the variable fighter`s first flight 2035. With the success of the flight tests, the U.N. Spacy adopted the VF-17 as a second line variable mecha and included squadrons on many of the colonization fleets, notably the 37th long-distance colonization fleet lead by the 7th Battle Class Stealth Space Attack Carrier in 2038.
The VF-17 Nightmare is a radically different variable fighter than previous generations, featuring completely new wing and transformation systems. Primarily designed as a special operations variable fighter and heavy battroid, the VF-17 is both larger and heavier than most other valkyries and features minimal atmospheric control surfaces subsequent to its primary role as a space fighter. To offset the nearly 12 ton weight, the VF-17 operates two extremely powerful Shinnakasu Heavy Industry/P&amp;W/Roice FF-2100X thermonuclear turbine engines with over twice as much thrust as the VF-11B. These incredibly powerful engines produce enough thrust for the VF-17 to achieve orbit unaided (the first production model variable fighter to do so) while also making the craft an ideal space superiority fighter. In addition to these powerful flight characteristics, the Nightmare is also designed as a stealth mecha and utilizes internally stored weaponry. As was typical following the success of a variable fighter, the VF-17 was eventually fitted with several equipment packages from Radomes and Fold Boosters to customized weaponry and Super Pack systems (though the VF-17 generally avoides the use of Super Parts and external weapons to maintain passive stealth capabilities).
The VF-17 was built in several different versions, but the VF-17D in service during the early 2040`s is the most distinguished model. Notable U.N. Spacy pilot http://anidb.net/ch41155 [Gamlin Kizaki] piloted a VF-17D Nightmare during his service in Macross 7`s elite unit Diamond Force until his promotion to Full Lieutenant when he was assigned a VF-17S. It was originally the intention of the UN Spacy that the VF-17 Nightmare be replaced as the primary special operations fighter of the UN Spacy by the VF-22S Sturmvogel II, also a General Galaxy design. However, by 2050`s the UN Spacy itself would undergo organizational changes as the New UN Spacy (NUNS) and priorities would also change. General Galaxy redesigned the VF-17 Nightmare into the VF-171 Nightmare Plus, a new main fighter/bomber for the New UN Spacy forces (circa 2059).

<description>The colonization of space that began in 2012, though initially beset by misfortune, was proving largely successful for the human race. Mass cloning provided significant population growth and the Megaroad Class ships were regularly carrying colonists to inhabit planets in the far reaches of space. Eventually, the growth of both the population and resources of the United Nations Government (UNG) demanded larger, more sophisticated ships to continue the colonization of space. The New Macross Class Super-Massive Colonization Battleships were designed and constructed. In 2030, the next major colonization fleet departed for the unknown with the first New Macross Class ship in command. With a total fleet population of over one million people, these massive colony fleets would quickly become the standard for the new wave of space colonization in the 2030`s.
The Battle Class Stealth Space Attack Carrier vessels are designed primarily as flagships for super-long-distance colonization fleets. Though armed for heavy anti-ship combat the primary role of the Battle Class is acting as mobile command center and the largest spacecraft/aircraft carrier in the fleet. The powerful main gun is a super beam weapon built as a mobile gunship separable from the ventral hull of the ship. The gunship is built with its own reactor and is capable of independent navigation if required. Like the SDF-1 Macross Class Super Dimension Fortress ships that preceded them, the Battle Class vessels are fully transformable ships that can convert into a humanoid-shaped Attack mode. The main gun is supplemented with four beam cannons but no additional turret weapons or missile launchers are found in most ships of this class. The Battle Class instead carries a large number of over 700 variable fighters, attack craft and bombers that can engage enemy fleets and any enemy attack craft. For rapid deployment of all aerospace craft, the Battle Class has twelve total standard catapults; six on the forward deck, three on the center deck and three on the aft port side angled deck. The ship is also equipped with three additional electromagnetic catapults and a command liaison hatch mounted just forward of the main bridge for immediately launching interceptor-fighters (typically VF-17D Nightmare fighters). For defense, the Battle Class has a pin-point barrier system and a short range full barrier system to defeat incoming enemy fire. In accordance with UN Spacy military doctrine for all ships of the line, the Battle Class has a stealth composition.
The City Class ships are designed as the super-long-distance colonization vessels of the New Macross Class. These ships almost always remained docked to the Battle Class vessels except in time of battle when the carrier will detach from the power plant docking unit mounted at the fore of the City ship. Inside the City Class ships is a fully functional city of roughly 350,000 people beneath the main dome. Outside the main city dome there is docking bay island (approximately 300 meters long) and the event dome. The City ships are powered by a separate reactor and even feature a basic space fold system for short-range interstellar travel. The City Class ships have no weapons and the City ship docked with the first Battle Class, Macross 1, had no defensive system. However, later City Class ships are all designed with a defensive shell that covers the city section of the craft in times of emergency (though both docking bay island and the event domes remain uncovered by the shell).
Perhaps the most distinguished of this ship class is the Macross 7 of the 37th long-distance colonization fleet that took part in the Protodeviln War in 2045. The 37th long-distance colonization fleet consisted of 1 x Battle 7/City 7 (Macross 7), 1 x Einstein Research Experimental Ship, 1 x Hollywood Amusement Ship, 1 x Riviera Resort Ship, 1 x Sunnyflower Agricultural Ship, 1 x Three Star Factory Ship, 1 x West Point Class Macro-Training Base Ship, one or more Mark Twain VII Resort Ships, 45 x Guantánamo Class Stealth Carriers (for use in space), 20 x Uraga Class Escort Battle Carriers (for use in air and space) and lastly 120 x Northampton Class Stealth Frigates (for use in air and space). The ship-carried aircraft/spacecraft for the entire fleet consisted of approximately 1,800 x variable fighters (mostly VF-11C Thunderbolts), 600 x variable attack craft, 9 x variable bombers, 120 x electronic reconnaisance fighters, 60 x cargo plane/freight transports and 100 x liason craft. Total fleet count is 194 large ships and 2,689 small craft. Commanded by Maximillian Jenius, the Battle 7 participated in numerous engagements against the Varauta Army throughout the war. Both the crew of the Battle 7 and the colonists of City 7 worked together during the ProtodevilnWar to develop a highly specialized sound technology that was used by several City 7 citizens to combat the Protodevlin. The infamous variable fighter unit Sound Force was stationed onboard the Macross 7 and the pilots - who together formed the rock band Fire Bomber - lived in the "Akusho" (or Acshio) area, the docking bay island section of City 7.

<description>The Battle Class Stealth Space Attack Carrier vessels are designed primarily as flagships for super-long-distance colonization fleets. Though armed for heavy anti-ship combat the primary role of the Battle Class is acting as mobile command center and the largest spacecraft/aircraft carrier in the fleet. The powerful main gun is a super beam weapon built as a mobile gunship separable from the ventral hull of the ship. The gunship is built with its own reactor and is capable of independent navigation if required. Like the SDF-1 Macross Class Super Dimension Fortress ships that preceded them, the Battle Class vessels are fully transformable ships that can convert into a humanoid-shaped Attack mode. The main gun is supplemented with four beam cannons but no additional turret weapons or missile launchers are found in most ships of this class. The Battle Class instead carries a large number of over 700 variable fighters, attack craft and bombers that can engage enemy fleets and any enemy attack craft. For rapid deployment of all aerospace craft, the Battle Class has twelve total standard catapults; six on the forward deck, three on the center deck and three on the aft port side angled deck. The ship is also equipped with three additional electromagnetic catapults and a command liaison hatch mounted just forward of the main bridge for immediately launching interceptor-fighters (typically VF-17D Nightmare fighters). For defense, the Battle Class has a pin-point barrier system and a short range full barrier system to defeat incoming enemy fire. In accordance with UN Spacy military doctrine for all ships of the line, the Battle Class has a stealth composition.

<description>As the main variable fighter of the U.N. Spacy in 2038, numerous VF-11C Thunderbolts are stationed aboard the 37th long-distance colonization fleet as it is lead by the 7th New Macross class battleship. This version of the Thunderbolt variable fighter features enhanced navigational electronic equipment (this upgrade was eventually installed in all VF-11 fighters from 2040 onward, starting with the first squadron). In 2045 the VF-11C squadrons are deployed in combat regularly since the outbreak of hostilities against the Varauta. Originally the VF-11C benefited from improved safety features which jettisoned the entire cockpit section of the craft in the event of the variable fighter`s destruction. However, this feature has not improved pilot safety in combat against the Varauta and many ejected pilots find themselves subjected to the Spiritia draining weaponry of Varauta mecha. Nonetheless, the VF-11C remains the backbone of the UNS forces for deep space colonization fleets. With hulls painted in bright blue-white, the VF-11C variable fighters of the Macross 7 fleet serve with distinction under command of Captain Maximilian Jenius.

<description>The colony ships that pioneered the great migration into space eventually grew into entire fleets of vessels with populations in excess of a million people. As the size of these colonization fleets increased the time spent traveling through space became a more important consideration for the effect upon the populace. Specialized vessels were built to help fulfill the needs of the colonists who could be traveling to habitable planets for years before settling. The Riviera Resort Ships were designed as vacation vessels, with hotels and casinos for high-class leisure. These large spaceships are over 6 kilometers long and are designed for marine life cultivation and breeding. Underneath a massive transparent dome an artificial 3.6km diameter ocean has been built with a coastline over 10 kilometers long. The forward section includes a large starport for visiting craft and numerous searchlights dot the exterior hull.
As large and important vessels carrying some 100,000 people, the Riviera ships feature defensive options to be used in the event of an emergency. The transparent dome can be covered with an armored shell to protect the population inside and the forward section of the ship is built with a dock to accommodate an Uraga Class Escort Battle Carrier. When the 7th New Macross-Class battleship departed with the 37th long-distance colonization fleet in 2038, a Riviera Resort Ship was among the vessels under its command. The Riviera was also part of the Milky Road inter-ship network which helped ferry small passenger and transport ships in between the vessels of the fleet.

<description>Guvava is a Gyarashi from the planet Pukirases V. He is an intelligent rodent whose fur is so thick he resembles a tribble with eyes. He also has a tail, which he can use to swing and propel himself with, and short legs. Guvava was rescued from his predator-rich environment by Maximilian Jenius in 2036, who found him injured and alone while on a mission. Upon returning home, Max gave him to his youngest daughter, Mylene, to care for. Mylene, then five years old, immediately fell in love with Guvava and helped nurse him back to health. Though Guvava was initially withdrawn, Mylene always stayed close to him, taking him with her almost everywhere, even to school, and the two soon became good friends. Guvava grew to become fiercely devoted to his "mistress" and can often be seen perching on her shoulder. He is telepathically linked to her and can seek her out when they are separated, and understand her speech, though he can only communicate in squeaks. In the presence of danger he rears up, his fur developing angry spikes, and he will even leap to attack if provoked. During Macross 7, set nine years later (in 2045-46), Mylene and Guvava are almost always together, even during concerts and space battles. Mylene states that Guvava is not simply a pet but rather, is a part of herself and she cares for him as much as she does for her human/Zentraedi friends and family.
Despite his small size, Guvava helps to protect Mylene as much as Mylene protects him. In episode 12 of Macross 7, Mylene is kidnapped by infiltration agents of the protodeviln. Guvava uses his telepathic ability to transmit Basara`s music to her and she begins to sing. Guvava is then able to lead Basara and Ray to her location. In Macross Dynamite 7, Mylene is invited to dinner by a woman who works to promote her music. However, the woman secretly drugs Mylene with the intention of sexually molesting her. Guvava immediately runs off to alert Mylene`s friends, Veffidas and Ray, who quickly arrive and smash their way into the room to save Mylene. Ray later states that if it hadn`t been for Guvava, the woman would have likely succeeded in forcing herself on Mylene.

<description>The VF-11MAXL Custom was the third variable fighter modified by the Macross 7 Special Technologies Group for deployment in Sound Force. The paramilitary unit consists of civilian singers/pilots from the rock band http://anidb.net/ch49391 [Fire Bomber] utilizing modified valkyries to use Sound Energy against the Varauta Army of the Protodeviln. http://anidb.net/ch14046 [Mylene Flare Jenius] is assigned the VF-11MAXL Custom modified with a unique guitar sound stick control mounted on gimbal-and-joint system with throttle and options control on slider for HOTAS control. Piloting this variable fighter http://anidb.net/ch14046 [Mylene] participated in numerous sorties against Varauta forces along with http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Nekki Basara] in the http://anidb.net/ch49268 [VF-19 Custom] and http://anidb.net/ch14529 [Ray Lovelock] and http://anidb.net/ch14970 [Veffidas Feaze] in the http://anidb.net/ch49490 [VF-17T Custom].
The VF-11MAXL Custom is lightly armed, like most of the variable fighters modified for use in the Sound Force unit. The head cannon and gun pod were removed, leaving only four missile launchers in the dorsal/shoulder sections, two internal engine/leg launchers and two laser cannons. The primary weapon is a speaker-pod-firing launcher pod mounted on the ventral fuselage in fighter mode or in the manipulator in GERWALK and Battroid modes. http://anidb.net/ch14046 [Mylene] uses this weapon to fire speaker pods into enemy mecha and transmit sound energy directly to the enemy pilots. The variable fighter is also equipped with a high performance audio system and speaker system (speaker units mounted nose in Fighter and GERWALK modes or front torsoin Battroid mode) and a lightup projector system. The VF-11MAXL has also been modified with enhanced engines and more powerful vernier thrusters for faster performance and greater maneuverability.

<description>In March 2040 the Project Super Nova Advanced Variable Fighter (AVF) competition ended disastrously for General Galaxy with the complete destruction of their second http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21] prototype variable fighter in the "Sharon Apple Incident". The UNG military decided to adopt the http://anidb.net/ch48621 [YF-19] design from Shinsei Industries and mass production of the VF-19 commenced as the new main variable fighter of the UN Forces. General Galaxy however bravely continued onward with their development of the http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21] and redesigned the brainwave control system so that it was not the primary control system of the craft. The active stealth capabilities and payload abilities of the http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21] were evaluated and General Galaxy produced the VF-22 Sturmvogel II as a special operations Valkyrie built in small numbers. It was a successful gamble for General Galaxy and in December 2042 the decision was made to formerly adopt the VF-22 Sturmvogel II as a special operations variable fighter.
The VF-22 Sturmvogel II retained many of the advanced technologies in the http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21] prototype fighter. The brainwave control system BDI (Brain Direct Image), the main improvement from the http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21], was significantly simplified and worked in conjunction with a primary manual operating system within a corresponding cockpit. Simplification of the BDI system reduced the enormous cost of the unit and the weight of the equipment. The cockpit is also redesigned with an overhead spherical canopy offering superior visibility in Fighter and GERWALK configurations. In Battroid mode the forward interior canopy is built with a large partial sphere monitor providing a 180 degree view forward. All three laser cannons on the http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21] prototype were replaced with converging energy beam guns for the VF-22 but the production model retains the four dorsal missile launchers (in addition to 4 ventral ports) and large missile ordnance stowed in three internal pallets. As a further refinement the VF-22 features two sensor units (one mounted to the rear) in a newly configured head unit as opposed to the five sensors found on the old http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21]. The VF-22 is also armed with two gatling gun pods with retractable stealth covers and includes a pin-point barrier defensive system.
The first VF-22S fighters were manufactured by the Macross 7 fleet Three Star Factory Ship under experimental license. Two fighters were produced and flown by http://anidb.net/ch41156 [Max] and http://anidb.net/ch41157 [Milia Jenius] in the final stages of the Protodeviln War in February 2046.
BDI system functions as a sub-system, assisting in weapons control, chaff, or smoke during air-combat maneuvers where high G`s are required
BDI system for assistance; engine block remains on main body in GERWALK and Battroid modes, enabling effcient use of main engine thrust and providing high mobility compared to past VFs.

<description>By 2047, the VF-19 Excalibur had begun deployment in even the outermost colonies of the UNG. The planet Zola military forces made use of a special Zolan variant called the VF-19P colored off white with red highlights. http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Nekki Basara] visited the planet Zola and became involved in an incident during the space whale migration. Using the power of his music, http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Basara] piloted a special customized version of the VF-19P outfitted with speaker units designed by a Zolan scientist named Lawrence to engage the space whales in orbit. In the VF-19P http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Basara] assisted the space whales during their migration cycle. The VF-19P itself was near a reaction warhead detonation that struck the white space whale, the resulting injury caused the great beast to send forth a spray of pollen that stained the Battroid red (Macross Chronicle, Issue #22). To the untrained eye, it appeared as if once again http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Basara] was piloting his old Fire Valkyrie from the Protodeviln War in 2045-2046.
