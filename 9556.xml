<recommendations total="27">
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="307987">After the 1st episode it gets a bit slow but we are rewarded with a good plot development about 60% of the way in. I`m glad I didn`t give up on it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="364389">I would only recommend Gargantia for fans of mechas. The characters are pretty shallow and stereotypical, the dialogues are uninteresting and the story is not really well-thought-out. There are some interesting moments but I had the feeling of "I`ve already seen this somewhere" throughout the show. It`s like a mix of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann without the humor, the movie Waterworld and some mecha anime you`ve probably already seen.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="222324">Amazing show. Not for Shounen fans @ all. More a very nice slice of life anime. I was looking forward to a great space mecha instead I get a nice story. Nothing wrong with that, it still great. Highly recommended.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="538961">Skirting the genre. 

Heavy emphasis on setting rather than plot; more "slice of life" than adventure. This is not fast paced, action filled or on a grand scale. If you like your anime with a bang, this may not be for you. When there is action it`s well done.

Contrary to what some others have said, it may be mecha fans themselves who`d find themselves disappointed with this one.

With an above average production value and likable characters, this is overall a pleasing, if tepid, watch. 
Going in without expectations I believe the general viewer will find something enjoyable here.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="30352">For MECHA fans only. Dropped at episode 5</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="477898">Beautiful animation, and a solid, compelling sci-fi story with a conclusion that is satisfying enough. And the ED theme, 10/10, love the ED theme.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="163989">For those who want to feast their eyes, it`s truly a scenery porn series.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="533051">Little slow at first, but nevermind...
for all mecha fans this is totally worth it, the psychologycal story is good, and drama also acceptible...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="296921">Furious energy and intelligence right out of the starting gate!

Right now I`m praying to all the Gods of Narrative that they can hold that level and actually tell a story worthy of this energy! Please, please, oh please!!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="545153">This anime has a very heartwarming feel and is not your average Mecha type of anime. It`s more of a SoL than it is anything Gundam-like. It`s a good watch if you like socially-awkward, comedic, SoL anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="572395">very good anime i can say its mix between drama and mecha fight furious energy with good story .. deserve to watch
but there are some or little boring in 2 or 3 episode</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="75448">Haven`t recommended anime after 1st ep for years! This is such promising mecha anime, 1st ep blow up my mind.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="385674">Very interesting start and a promising future coupled with excellet animation.  Definitely one of the animes to tune into this Spring.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="84998">This is a character drama more than a mecha-space-battle series. However, it combines elements from both fluidly and in an enjoyable way. If you like mecha but are also concerned with excellent characters and story, don`t pass this up.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="264842">Fantastic in every sense of the word.
A must-see for everyone , sci-fi , mecha , post-apocalypse , humor , romance ..

One downside .. 13 episodes , as is indicated here is too short. I would have hoped 52 , greedy as I am.

Still , depending on the end , a second season might be possible.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="94967">Having started before Psycho-Pass was even over, it was too close to it and got not just overshadowed but outright sunken. Upon a spontaneous rewatch my initial complaints of it essentially being not as refined as Psycho-Pass (at least partially due to probably being aimed at a younger or perhaps less demanding audience) still holds true. But with hindsight of many years of much worse and with my Psycho-Pass hype/rave having calmed down, I now see that Suisei no Gargantia is on its own a very good anime. I`d say more but this has gotten long enough, just watch it as long as you want some semi-serious yet colorful science-fiction with slight hints of romance.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="291605">Amazing animation, probably the best this year. Great story for the first 2/3 of the series. Until the last arc this anime is flawless to me. Its only fault is the weak ending</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="526461">i say to each its own opinion but this is a good story and anime, great settings and lots of genres, just hope they bring another season</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="133308">Real sci-fi atmosphere and great setting. Nothing like the mecha spam of the recent seasons.

Watch the first two and see for yourself!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="23892">Very Good! I love you Amy! :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="410747">Very good plot. Very good graphic and animation.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="389161">This show really hit the spot for me. Wish it was longer to develop the romance theme in this.</recommendation>

<description>The story begins in the distant future in the far reaches of the galaxy. The Human Galactic Alliance has been constantly fighting for its survival against a grotesque race of beings called Hideous. During an intense battle, the young lieutenant http://anidb.net/ch51227 [Ledo] and his humanoid mobile weapon http://anidb.net/ch51232 [Chamber] are swallowed up into a distortion of time and space.
Waking from his artificially induced hybernation, Ledo realises that he has arrived on Earth, the planet on the lost frontier. On this planet that was completely flooded by the seas, people live in fleets of giant ships, salvaging relics from the seas` depths in order to survive.
Ledo arrives on one of the fleets called Gargantia. With no knowledge of the planet`s history or culture, he is forced to live alongside http://anidb.net/ch51233 [Amy], a 15-year-old girl who serves as a messenger aboard the Gargantia fleet. To Ledo, who has lived a life where he knows nothing but fighting, these days of peace continue to surprise him.

<description>In a http://anidb.net/t2846 [science fiction] setting, the robot helper is, in a comedic sense, pretty much equivalent to what the "cute comic relief http://anidb.net/t1835 [animal sidekick]" is in a fantasy setting. The usually small machine has artificial intelligence, enabling it to support their owner / master with advice or help with menial tasks.

<name>pirate</name>
<description>Pirates are people who attack ships on the high seas to rob others of their treasure. Well, at least usually. Other people calling themselves pirates are not unheard of, usually focusing on the freedom and romance involved in the piracy-related tropes and cliches. They may or may not be after the One Piece or a spaceship full of diamonds, too, if that`s what they see as treasure. Real-life pirates were extremely common a few centuries ago, and countries even sponsored their own pirates, called "privateers", to attack ships with flags of other countries. Nowadays, however, very few actual pirates still exist, and they rely more on terrorism and guerrilla warfare than anything else, demanding ransom in exchange for hostages instead of openly attacking the enemies with their swords. Another, more modern meaning for the word refers to people who illegally download copyrighted works they are not entitled to have a copy of. Be whichever it may, there are pirates around here. Arr, avast! Thar be pirates in these dark waters, matey!</description>

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<tag id="2606" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2018-11-05">
<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<description>Story-wise, genetic modification is usually centred on humans, probably the most subtle and creepy way of messing with mankind. Playing with the fear of the unknown, genetically altered humans are technically a new species, that may not only surpass but actually replace unaltered humans. The level of modification will vary from subtle changes in "look" (e.g. super-human beauty), to mental enhancements (PSI powers), to more or less atrocious adaptations to extreme environments (breath under water, radiation resistance). Note that changes in Aliens would be difficult to pinpoint, after all they are alien.</description>

<name>post-apocalyptic</name>
<description>An anime that takes place on future Earth (or it could be an alternative universe) after a major cataclysm has occurred. World War III, an alien invasion, plague, global warming or some other general disaster are common themes to build a post-apocalyptic world upon, where the effects were severe enough that mankind barely survived.
The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologised). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in an agrarian, non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of technology remain. There is a considerable degree of blurring between post-apocalyptic fiction and that which deals with false utopias or dystopian societies.</description>

<name>fictional language</name>
<description>Fictional languages are intended to be the languages of a fictional world and are often designed with the intent of giving more depth and an appearance of plausibility to the fictional worlds with which they are associated, and to have their characters communicate in a fashion which is both alien and dislocated.
Some of these languages, e.g. in worlds of fantasy fiction, alternative universes, Earth`s future, or alternate history, are presented as distorted versions or dialects of modern English or other natural language, while others are independently designed conlangs.
A fictional language often has the least amount of grammar and vocabulary possible, and rarely extends beyond the absolutely necessary. At the same time, some others have developed languages in detail for their own sake, such as J. R. R. Tolkien`s Quenya and Sindarin and Star Trek`s Klingon language which exist as functioning, usable languages. Here "fictional" can be a misnomer.</description>

<name>belly dance</name>
<description>Belly dance is any solo, improvised dance based on torso articulation originating from the Middle East. Belly dance takes many different forms depending on region, both in costume and dance style, and new styles have evolved in the West as its popularity has spread globally. In the Middle East, belly dance has two functions: as a social dance, it is performed by ordinary men and women of all ages at celebrations and social gatherings, although in more traditional societies such occasions are gender segregated, with separate parties for men and women; as an art, professionals perform it with an emphasis on stagecraft and special costumes designed to show off the movements to best effect, but they are not seen as respectable in the Middle East, with a strong social stigma attached to female dancers in particular, since the display of their bodies in public is considered sinful.

Due to the nature of crossover games and licensing involved, only a few games have been released outside Japan, and in English; early English-language games only feature Banpresto`s original characters and mecha, and a flagship installment were to never be released until 2016, with the English release of Super Robot Wars V in Southeast Asian countries.

<summary>When Ledo has an encounter with a whalesquid undersea, he attacks and kills it because of its similar appearance to the Hideauze. Little did he know that whalesquid are considered sacred, so murdering one is taboo, and soon the whole ship is in an uproar over it. Ledo, however, believes that whalesquid are Hideauze and he`s determined to carry out his mission by slaughtering more of them before they decide to target humans on Earth. Just as Amy tries to stop Ledo, a huge pod of whalesquid approaches the fleet...

But the Kugel fleet seeks to assimilate Flange`s fleet... with Pinion`s help!

Meanwhile, power quickly goes to Pinion`s head.
