<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>fictional location</name>
<description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth, computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals, and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091 [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China, Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>Butterfree</name>
<gender>dimorphic</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Butterfree is a dual-type Bug/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Metapod starting at level 10. It is the final form of Caterpie. It also has a Gigantamax form.
Butterfree resembles a vaguely anthropomorphic butterfly with a purple body. Unlike true insects, it only has two body segments and four light blue legs. The upper pair of legs resembles small, three-fingered hands, while the lower pair resembles long, digit-less feet. Butterfree has two black antennae, a light blue snout with two fangs underneath, and large, red compound eyes. Its two pairs of wings are white with black venation. Two oval scales on a female Butterfree`s lower wings are black, but they are white on a male.
As Gigantamax Butterfree, its size increases to gigantic length with altered look. The wings and its pattern changes to light and dark green color with white. The antennae change to bright green and extends to the point where the tip bends, and three red clouds surround it. The eyes changes to bright glowing red. A fur-like circle is attached to both the wings and back of Butterfree. Several green scales can be seen floating around Butterfree, which are its most effective weapons, capable of releasing paralysis, poisoning, or sleep. The massive wings are powerful enough to lift a 10-ton truck through a simple flap. The wind it generates can scatter poisonous scales throughout the area, making it dangerous to be near it.
Butterfree`s wings are covered with poisonous powders that fall off continuously as it flies. It will defend Caterpie from bird Pokémon using this powder. This powder also repels water, enabling it to gather honey even in the rain. Butterfree will roam up to six miles (ten kilometers) from its nest in search of honey, which it carries with the hairs of its legs. Sometimes it has territorial disputes with Cutiefly over fields of flowers. It also consumes sap from trees pierced by Heracross, as seen in the anime. Butterfree is found in temperate forests and jungles, but it has also been observed flying near the ocean as part of its migratory breeding pattern.
Gigantamax Butterfree is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Befuddle.</description>

<description>Pidgeotto, known as the Bird Pokémon, is a bird-like Pokémon, is a larger and stronger form that Pidgey takes when it gains enough experience. In the main Pokémon game series, a Pidgeotto is only acquired when a Pidgey grows past experience level 18 and evolves into a Pidgeotto. A Pidgeotto is extremely territorial, generally claiming a large area with its nest built in the center. Full of vitality, it constantly patrols its territory, mercilessly attacking intruders. They fly about in circular patterns while hunting, and can spot the movements of their prey on the ground no matter how high they fly. The Pidgeotto attacks with its wickedly sharp talons and carries its prey, including Exeggcute and Magikarp, back to its nest from as far as 60 miles away - or more.
Pidgeotto was the second Pokémon Ash caught in the beginning of his career, eventually evolving into Pidgeot.</description>

<description>Spearow is a small, bird Pokémon with short wings and a small, stubby beak. It is noted for being frail, but it makes up for that with its "Mirror Move" ability. It eats insects in grassy areas by flushing them out with its wings, and plucking at them with its beak. Its wings aren`t good for long distance travel or high flying, but it is able to fly at high speeds by flapping its wings very rapidly. It is very territorial, constantly buzzing about and calling with a loud cry that can be heard from half a mile away. It serves to scare away predators and keep in touch with other Spearow, which usually is used to alert them of danger. The golden spearow has golden wings and a golden beak, it also has a lighter color of brown feathers.</description>

Along with Weezing, Arbok is often associated with Team Rocket because of its role in the anime.</description>

Nidoqueen seem to be omnivores feeding on shrubs and fruit but they may snack on certain small Pokémon for protein. Also, Nidoqueen are much less aggressive than Nidoking and get along much better with others of their kind. Nidoqueen appears to be slightly weaker, but significantly more intelligent than Nidoking.</description>

<description>Nidoking are a fully grown and developed species of male possum-like Pokémon and the final stage in the male Nidoran evolutionary line. Its horn is hard enough to pierce a diamond and contains secreted venom, making it a powerful stabbing tool upon prey and Pokémon battle opponents. Nidoking have immense upper-body strength, being able to snap a telephone pole like it were a twig. It uses its tail to smash down its target, then constrict it to break its bones. Its thick tail packs enormously destructive power capable of toppling a metal transmission tower.
As several Pokémon seem to have been designed to resemble other aspects of Japanese pop culture and mythology, it is interesting to note that Nidoking bears a resemblance to Baragon, a monster that has appeared in the Godzilla movie series.
In the main Pokémon game series, a Nidoking can only be acquired when a Moon Stone item is applied to a Nidorino so that the creature is evolved into a Nidoking. They are the masculine equivalent to Nidoqueen. Also, they are more primal, fighting other Nidoking for such matters as territory or food. (Or a Nidoqueen, in mating season.)</description>

<description>Jigglypuff, known as the "Balloon" species of Pokémon, are characterized by putting their enemies to sleep by singing a lullaby. Before beginning to sing, they mesmerize the opponent with their soft, glowing eyes, and if they inflate themselves, they can sing for longer periods of time. They can easily adjust the wavelength of their voices to that of the brain waves of a sleeping being, allowing for their pleasing melody to put its audience to sleep. They sing without pausing to take a breath, so if the opponent is resistant to sleeping, they potentially run out of air.
In the Pokémon anime series, Jigglypuff is a recurring character who aspires to be a great singer after the inspiration of Ash Ketchum and company. Unfortunately for it, every potential audience falls asleep before the song finishes. Jigglypuff does not usually choose an appropriate time to sing and has been a hazard many times, causing Ash Ketchum and his companions to often find themselves running away from Jigglypuff. It keeps with it a black marker, its "microphone," and uses it to scribble on anyone who falls asleep while it`s performing.
Its desire to have someone listen to the entire song was finally satisfied when it encountered a Whismur, who was able to stay awake due to its Soundproof ability.
Also, Jigglypuff`s Japanese name, Purin, translates into "pudding".</description>

<description>Golbat are a larger, stronger, and more developed form that Zubat take on when they gain enough experience. In the main Pokemon game series, a Golbat is acquired when a Zubat grows past experience level 22 and is evolved into a Golbat. Golbat are found in some cave areas.
Golbat is a fierce, nocturnal Pokémon, residing in the darkness of caves, and is most active in the pitch black of night, especially if the moon is in its new phase. It is widely known and despised for its feeding behavior: Sucking fresh blood from living things in large quantities. Once it has found a living target, it attacks in a stealthy manner, often striking without warning from behind, to harshly bite down on its prey with its four sharp fangs strong enough to puncture the hide of any animal-like Pokemon, however strong the hide might be. It then proceeds to drink ten ounces of blood instantly. Golbat enjoys blood so much that it does not want to stop, even though a lot of blood will weigh it down enough so that, if it is able to even fly afterwards, it flies clumsily.
Surprisingly, after each attack and feeding sequence, Golbat`s own blood type changes into that of its victim. Once it strikes, it will not stop draining energy from the victim even if it gets too heavy to fly. Like Zubat, the female`s fangs are smaller than the male`s.</description>

The burrow and excretions left by a Diglett, rather like those of a real-life earthworm, keep the soil aerated and fertile. For this reason, Diglett are prized by farmers.
The mysterious feet or hands of Diglett are unknown of what they look like, for the fact that Diglett can use moves such as slash and fury swipes. Only the head of a Diglett can be seen popping out of the ground.</description>

<description>Primeape is a larger and stronger evolution of Mankey. Vicious and frenzied, even making eye contact with it can anger it. If it is annoyed, it will never stop chasing the offender. Its frenzies are most dangerous when forcefully woken up, as it relentlessly chases the quarry while half-asleep. Primeape can be obtained when a Mankey has earned enough experience to level up to level 28. Primeape can also be found in some grassy areas in Kanto and Johto.</description>

<description>Geodude has a rock for a head, no nose, and two long arms that start with a bulging muscle and end with rock hands resembling a human`s. Geodude most frequently are found in fields and on mountains. People step or trip on them from time to time, mistaking them for rocks. Its arms are so strong that it can use them to climb mountains. Rhyperior sometimes accidentally shoot Geodude from their cannon-like arms. Geodudes are one of the few Pokémon to have appeared in every Pokémon game.
In the video games, Geodude is commonly found inside caves and mountains, and sometimes appears when Rock Smash is used. Geodude are also found in the Nintendo 64 game Pokémon Snap, hanging from mountainsides by their arms. In the Super Smash Bros. Melee battlefield "Poké Floats", a Geodude is the last float the fighters ride on before returning to the Squirtle float.
Geodude is a recurring character in the Pokémon anime. It first appeared in the fifth episode, "Showdown in Pewter City," used by Gym Leader Brock to battle Ash. Brock became a travel companion of Ash and owned Geodude for the first five seasons. Navel Island Gym Leader Danny and Rustboro City Gym Leader Roxanne have also used Geodude. In the anime, Geodude is able to levitate above the ground.
Geodude`s name comes from the word "Geode" as in a rock with a sparkly inside, and "Dude," usually used to describe a certain kind of male person.</description>

<description>Graveler resembles a large boulder with four arms and two legs. It lives and feeds on rocky mountains. It will climb the slope of a mountain daily, snacking on small rocks along the way, and roll back down once it has reached the peak. Though it is not very fast when walking, a Graveler rolling down a mountain trail is a very dangerous thing to encounter. Carefree by nature, Graveler ignores most obstacles that may appear in its path, such as grass, trees, boulders or even hikers, since it can roll through or over them more often than not. It is not essentially harmed rolling down the slope, even if the odd jutting piece of its body gets broken off. Machop are known to use Graveler as training weights.</description>

<description>Magnemite is almost more of a machine than a creature, as it is a solid ball of metal with a pair of horseshoe magnets on either side, as well as a single, lidless eye. It has a pair of screws protruding from below the eye, and a large screw forming a sort of "cap" on top of its head.
It floats through the air, through a sort of electromagnetic antigravity field generated by the two magnets on either side of its body. When defending itself in the wild or fighting in a Pokémon battle at the orders of a Pokémon trainer, it can also generate powerful electric shocks. Magnemite consumes electricity, so they`re attracted to power lines and electronic gadgets. Magnemite tend to crowd around generators and power plants, and an individual Magnemite might be attracted to someone with a pocket radio or a Pokégear.
Despite their mechanical appearance, lack of gender, and alien tendencies, Magnemite are living things; they are not built, they feel the need to eat, and they have something similar to a mating urge. A trio of Magnemite may come together to create their evolved form, Magneton.</description>

<description>Onix is a subterranean creature that bores its way through the ground at a rate of 50 mph (80 km/h) in search of food. The tunnels it leaves behind as it burrows through the earth are used as pre-dug homes by other subterranean Pokémon such as Diglett and Geodude. Within Onyx`s member is a structure nigh identical to a magnet, which allows it to determine its heading, its depth underground, and other such information useful for a subterranean Pokémon to know. It acts quite like a compass. As Onix ages, it burrows deeper underground, and its rocky member becomes progressively harder, rounder, and smoother. Around the age of 100, the pressures exerted on its stone member become so high that it is compressed into a much harder, diamond-like composition, although it is closer to metal in nature.
In the anime, an Onix is owned by Brock as part of the many Pokemon owned by the training gym that Brock`s family runs. Brock had initially received the Onix from his father, who is a specialist in rock-type Pokemon. When Brock feels the need to travel with Ash Ketchum yet again, he entrusts the care of the Onix to one of his many younger brothers. This takes place in Pokémon Chronicles. It eventually evolves into a Steelix.</description>

<description>Cubone`s name is a combination of the words cub and bone, in reference to its young age and relation to bones, both as weapons and armor. The "Cu-" may also be derived from cute, as Cubone is rather referred to as cute and lonely, or the derogatory term "cue ball", referring to a bald person, which is a reference to the skull it wears. Its Japanese name is most likely a pun on 空 kara (emptiness), 殻 kara (shell), and/or からから karakara (dried-up). In the Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow a Cubone is adopted by Mr. Fuji after its mother is killed by Team Rocket. Cubone is also a playable character in Pokémon Red Rescue Team and Pokémon Blue Rescue Team. The skull a Cubone wears on its head is said to be the skull of its mother, who dies whenever a Cubone is born. Because it never removes its skull helmet, no one has ever seen a Cubone`s actual face. Its cries for its mother are often heard echoing inside the skull.</description>

<description>Koffing is a Poison Type Pokémon that evolved into Weezing. Koffing is a spelling variant of coughing, one of the reactions experienced when in proximity of Koffing`s noxious gases. The Japanese name uses the English loanword "gas" (which is used by Japanese to refer to both gasoline and the state of matter), with the prefix "do" meaning "bad" or "poisonous". Koffing are often found near abandoned buildings (burned out preferred), Caves and Volcanic rich environments. Koffing spew gases from their crater like ridges that cover their body. Koffing have a Cyclops like Skull and Cross Bones symbol on their chest and stomach. The Skull has three teeth detailed on it. Koffing have two small fangs protruding from the top of its mouth. Koffing often have a jolly or spaced out expression on their face while looking up. James from Team Rocket used a Koffing until it evolved into a Weezing. In Pokémon Snap, Koffings can be seen following Jigglypuffs around causing Jigglypuff discomfort. Koffing is also one of the Pokémon signs as well as a star constellation in the game.</description>

<description>Weezing is a Poison-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Koffing starting at level 35.
In Galar, Weezing has a Poison/Fairy-type regional form. It evolves from Koffing starting at level 35. All Koffing in Galar evolve into this form regardless of their origin.
Weezing is a purple Pokémon consisting of two spherical heads connected by a thin tube with another sphere in the center. The heads have differing sizes and features. The left head is larger and has prominent eyebrows, pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw, and two flat teeth in its upper jaw. The smaller, right head simply has two pointed teeth, one at each corner of its mouth. The larger head has a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking below its face, while the smaller head has a ring marking instead. It is covered with many geyser-like protrusions, which usually expel mustard-colored gases. Weezing is said to form when poisonous gases pool and two Koffing fuse over many years. Very rarely, two Koffing can become a Weezing in a short timespan because of a sudden mutation. Triplet Weezing have been discovered, although they are extremely rare.
Each of Weezing`s heads contains a different toxin. It mixes its gases by inflating one head and deflating the other. When its gases mix, Weezing becomes more toxic and putrid. Weezing can hover in midair, presumably due to gases lighter than air, as is the case for Koffing. Despite their stench and poison, Weezing`s gases can be used to make top-grade perfume by diluting them to the highest level.
Weezing lives in urban areas. It seeks a dirty, unkempt house and nests there. At night, when the people in the house are asleep, it will go through the trash. Weezing feeds on the dust, microorganisms, and especially gases emitted by garbage and toxic waste. Weezing`s body expands and smells worse upon inhaling poisonous gases. The Kantoian Weezing used to be common in Galar and created more potent toxins than their Galarian relatives.
In the Galar region, its appearance has changed due to absorbing polluted air from factories. It has a grey body with with the skull, crossbones, and ring changed to color yellow. Both heads have a hat-like tube located on top of them that constantly release purified air. Five green puffs of poison gas clouds can be seen floating around it. The larger head has a cloud-like mustache, while the smaller has clouds on its face in the shape of eyebrows and a beard.
Galrian Weezing consumes particles from the polluted air. It expels clean air instead of droppings. The toxins within Weezing`s body are accumulated into poison gas clouds that leaks and drifts around it. The gas is Weezing`s best weapon in battle, being potent enough to stun and immobilize an opponent with just a whiff.
Galarian Weezing is the only known Pokémon capable of using the the move Strange Steam.</description>

<description>Rhyhorn is a rhinoceros like Pokemon with a rock like hide consisting of plates. Ryhorn stands on all four legs and evolves into Rhydon. Rhyhorn is a portmanteau of rhinoceros (which it resembles) and horn. Its spelling is also influenced by the rock rhyolite. Its Japanese name is a portmanteau of sai (犀), meaning rhinoceros and horn (ホーン). Rhyhorn are easily angered and will not hesitate to charge at what ever or who ever angered it. Rhyhorn are powerful enough to topple buildings with their tackle. Rhyhorn are prime examples of "more brawn than brains", as they often charge head first into things but forget why. In Gold, Silver, and Crystal, Brock uses a Rhyhorn to battle. There is also a Rhyhorn in the Brock Gym Leader set of the trading card game.</description>

<description>Rhydon appears to be a cross between a rhinoceros and a dinosaur. It is a massive, gray, bipedal creature with clawed forepaws and hindfeet and a long tail. Rhydon`s head has two horns: one is on its forehead, and another one at the end of its snout. The latter is bigger and seems to be styled after a drill. After the production of Pokémon Diamond/Pearl, it is revealed that the male Rhydon has a longer drill horn than the female.
Rhydon`s brain is considerably more developed than that of its pre-evolved form Rhyhorn, which allows it to exhibit some signs of advanced intelligence, including the ability to stand upright and walk on two legs. It is capable of living in molten lava under the ground.
Rhydon is notable for being one of the very few non-water rock type Pokémon to learn the move surf.</description>

<description>Since Electabuzz is electric, he feeds on electrical currents. Its methods of securing its food vary: during thunderstorms, an Electabuzz climbs to the highest place possible, in hopes that it will be struck by lightning. As a result, many towns in the Pokémon world employ an Electabuzz in lieu of a lightning rod. Electabuzz also lurk around power plants, feeding off the electricity generated there. This behavior is dangerous to the public, as occasionally blackouts are caused by an Electabuzz overindulging itself at a power plant, or worse, walking down to a city and drawing electricity from there.
Due to its unique diet, Electabuzz`s body is constantly discharging stored electricity, to the point that it glows whitish blue in darkness and static electricity effects manifest. An Electabuzz can control the electric current coursing in its body to communicate with other Electric-type Pokémon, especially with another Electabuzz. It originally is lone in its evolutionary line, but it gains a previous form, Elekid, in Pokémon Gold and Silver, and an evolution, Electivire, in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.
Like Scyther, as seen in the anime, Electabuzz is most likely provoked by the color red.</description>

<description>Magmar is born in the proximity of an active volcano, and if possible it spends its entire life there, or at least in a place hot enough to sustain its body temperature of 3,300 degrees Fahrenheit. If a Magmar finds itself in a cold place, it will try to make it more habitable by blowing scorching flames around. It has the ability to expel orange-colored fire from every part of its body, including its mouth. This serves both offensive and defensive purposes: a Magmar cloaked in flames resembles a big ball of fire. Together with its matching body coloration, Magmar can quite easily hide itself among flames, escaping detection. If Magmar is actually wounded, it can heal itself by dipping its wound(s) in lava. When it emerges, damp soil clings onto its body. In Gold and Silver, Magmar gets a pre-evolution, Magby, and in Diamond and Pearl, an evolution, Magmortar.
Magmar has appeared in the anime owned by various people but the ones of note are the Gym Leader Blaine, Ash`s now ex-rival, Gary Oak, and his new rival, Paul. Paul had been looking for a new fire Pokémon since the release of Chimchar in "Glory Blaze" and captured Magmar sometime between capturing Gliscor in ""Gliscor and Gligar: Getting Through the Wind Maze" and his Gym Battle, with Maylene which was shown as a flashback in "Lucario and the Aura Sphere of Rage."</description>

<description>Snorlax is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Munchlax when leveled up with high friendship. It also has a Gigantamax form.
In the Generation I and II games and their remakes, wild Snorlax can be found sleeping in inconvenient locations throughout Kanto. In order to catch one, a Trainer must first awaken it with music from either a Poké Flute or Pokégear set to the Poké Flute channel. A sleeping Snorlax makes a return in Pokémon X and Y, in which it is blocking the player`s way on Route 7.
Snorlax is a huge, bipedal, dark blue-green Pokémon with a cream-colored face, belly, and feet. Its body is composed of mostly its belly, as its limbs are comparatively small. Its head is large with small, pointed ears and two pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw. It has round feet, which both have three claws and a circular brown paw pad, and short arms with five claws on each hand. Snorlax`s bulk makes it the heaviest Normal type.
Snorlax is often found in mountains and forests. It wakes up only to eat, requiring 900 lbs. (400 kg) of food per day before returning to its slumber. It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it to eat even moldy food without feeling any ill effects. It can even handle thorny plants or Muk`s poison. It can also eat while it is resting. Snorlax is docile enough to let children and small Pokémon bounce on its large stomach.
Snorlax can show awesome power when prompted. As Gigantamax Snorlax, seeds and small rocks that were tangled in its belly fur goes through immense growth and a tree spouts upon its belly. The tree has three red clouds surrounding it like a circle. It almost never moves; even when in battle it only slightly lifts its body and attacks by flailing with its arms and legs. However, its attacks are very powerful — Gigantamax Snorlax is considered to be the strongest Dynamax Pokémon to have been discovered.
It is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Pulverizing Pancake and G-Max Move G-Max Replenish.</description>

<description>Raikou is one of the three "Legendary Beasts" that are featured in Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal. According to legend, the Legendary Beasts were reincarnated by Ho-Oh from the spirits of three Pokémon which died in the fire that gave Burnt Tower its name. They are awakened in this tower in their first appearance. Another myth maintains that Raikou descended to earth together with a lightning bolt. Each Beast personifies a force of nature - Raikou, in particular, embodies the speed of lightning.
Like many Electric-type Pokémon, Raikou stores tremendous energy inside its body. This grants it extraordinary vitality, allowing it to run continuously across the land while shooting off electricity from the rain cloud that is on its back. Raikou`s roar is aptly described as "thunderous": it is loud enough to create shock waves and shake the ground as if actual thunder had struck.
Raikou is featured in a special anime episode called Raikou - The Legend of Thunder that forms the first three episodes of Pokémon Chronicles. In the special, two Team Rocket agents named Attila and Hun scheme to capture Raikou with a device that reflects and deflects energy blasts. Three New Bark Town trainers risk their own lives to try and save Raikou. It is thought by the trainers that Raikou attempts to guard other electric Pokémon from danger whenever possible.</description>

They are awakened in this tower in their first video game appearance. Other myths maintains that it is born during the eruption of a volcano, and that a new one is born along with each volcano.
Entei is an embodiment of magma, being able to launch powerfully searing, fire that is hotter than magma from its mouth. This fire consumes everything that it touches. When it roars, volcanos around it are apparently triggered to erupt. Due to being unable to fully control its own power, it constantly sprints around the world.
Entei is the main Pokémon in the movie Pokémon the Movie 3: Spell of the Unown, in which the Unown create it from Molly`s imagination.</description>

They are awakened in this tower in their first video game appearance. It is the incarnation of northern winds, which always blow as it passes throughout the world. It also embodies the compassion of a spring, so as it travels, it seeks out pure reservoirs of water, and using its power, it instantly purifies dirty, muddy, or otherwise polluted water into the clearest of liquids by simply stepping into it.
In Pokémon Crystal Suicune is the star Pokémon, in a similar way that Pokémon Gold showcased Ho-oh or Pokémon Silver showcased Lugia. Eusine, a mysterious trainer, appears throughout the course of the game. He is set on meeting and catching Suicune, and will battle the player for that honor. Eventually, Suicune can be caught by heading to the Tin Tower after obtaining the Clear Bell. Three old men will challenge the player to a battle and if they are defeated, they will allow access to a floor where Suicune waits to battle.
Suicune makes various appearances in the anime, mainly appearing before Ash and his friends. It is featured in various episodes, and it plays a role in the movie, Pokémon 4Ever.</description>

<description>Ho-Oh is a legendary Pokémon that first appears in Pokémon Gold and Silver, appearing on Gold`s boxart. Long ago in Ecruteak City, there were two towers, the Brass Tower and Tin Tower being the roost of Lugia and Ho-Oh, respectively. When the Brass Tower burned down, both Pokémon fled, never to be seen again. Three Pokémon became trapped in the flames of the Brass Tower and perished. Ho-Oh returned to the Burned Tower and resurrected the three Pokémon, who were renamed Raikou, Entei, and Suicune. It has an unknown gender. On Gold, it is Lv40 when caught while it is Lv70 when caught in Silver. It is better to have the lower version as the move tutor does not exist in Gold/Silver.
It is called the Rainbow Pokémon due to its various associations with rainbows. Its feathers constantly change through the rainbow`s spectrum of colors as light hits them from different angles. These leave a rainbow trail as it flies continuously through the world`s skies, though it is said to live at the foot of a rainbow. It is said to appear before pure-hearted trainers as the representative of the bonds between humans and Pokémon, and bring happiness to all that see it. This is expanded upon in the anime, where it is said to appear before a hero. Ash Ketchum sees Ho-Oh various times throughout his journey, the first time being before Gold and Silver were even announced. It remained a mystery until it was revealed in Pokémon Gold.</description>

<description>Jessie is one half of of the Team Rocket duo that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokemon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
Jessie`s mother, Miyamoto, was a high-ranking Team Rocket agent. When Jessie was around the age of three, Miyamoto left on a mission to the Andes Mountains to record the voice of the elusive Pokemon Mew. However, Miyamoto disappeared, and Jessie was put into a foster home which had very little money. There were times when she had no choice but to eat snow because of a lack of more nourishing food.
When she was old enough, she left home to become a Pokemon nurse in Jouto. However, the school she was enrolled in was literally for Pokemon nurses (i.e. Chansey), so she failed to graduate and left, leaving behind a Chansey she had befriended there. It is assumed that she then traveled back to Kanto, where she enrolled in Pokemon Tech, a trainer`s school, met James, and subsequently failed and dropped out. After this, Jessie and James joined a bicycle gang in Sunny Town, where Jessie was known for swinging a chain above her head as she rode her bike (nicknamed "Chainer Jess").
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between Jessie and James after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Sometime before joining Team Rocket, and it is not known when, Jessie obtained a Contest Pass in the Hoenn region. Also during the years before Team Rocket, she had several boyfriends, all of whom left her and/or treated her badly. In "Xatu the Future", she revealed that she had once worked at a T.V. station as the Weathergirl. In "From Cradle to Save" is also revealed that she once was a ninja.
She has a long-standing bitter rivalry with Cassidy, another member of Team Rocket. Another member, Wendy, held a grudge against Jessie for failing to pay for a drink (making Wendy pay), but got her revenge when she added the charge to Jessie`s overall Team Rocket bill.
In the episode "Ignorance is Blissey", Jessie was reunited with her friend Chansey from the Pokemon nurse school; Chansey had since evolved into a Blissey.
Starting in Hoenn, Jessie has become a Pokemon Coordinator, entering every contest that she could. She frequently makes it to the battle round, but usually loses there. However, in "Borrowing on Bad Faith", she finally succeeded in winning an (unofficial) contest by using Ash`s Aipom, which she had saved earlier in the episode. And, in "Team Shocker!", she finally wins an official contest with her Dustox in at Solaceon City. Later she also won a ribbon with help of her Yanmega. She has Contest Passes to compete in the Hoenn, Kanto, and Sinnoh regions.
While Jessie`s role in the Pokemon anime has not yet ended, in Toshihiro Ono`s manga, "The Electric Tale of Pikachu", she ended up married to James and with child.
Jessie seems to have a special preference for snake-like Pokemon, owning both an Arbok and a Seviper. In "The Ninja Poke Showdown", she expressed a preference for Poison-type Pokemon in general.
For unknown reasons, she, James and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation.
In the Kanto contests, Jessie disguises herself as Jessebella (which is similar to James former fiancee Jessiebelle) wearing a red dress and glasses. Eventually, Ash, Brock, Max and May finds out her true identity at the last contest.
During the Kanto Grand Festival, Jessie dresses up as Jessadia (Japanese: キャンディ・ムサリーナ Candy Musalina). and wears glasses, long white socks, a yellow and orange dress, and has her hair in pigtails. She works there as an announcer and Lilian Meridian`s assistant; Lilian herself says she may not really like "Jessadia"`s style, but recognizes her talent. In the Latin American dub, she enters Super Contests under the name Jessiebella (referencing Jessiebelle again). Jessie currently still continues to use the Jessalina disguise while participating in Super Contests.
In "Pruning a Passel of Pals!" and "Strategy With a Smile!" she once again used her Jessadia disguise to report on the Wallace Cup.
Although Jessie had entered mostly every contest in Hoenn &amp; Kanto, she lost in every single one, whether it was the first match of the Battle Rounds or the finals. But in the Sinnoh Region, she has so far won 2 ribbons using her Dustox and Yanmega.</description>

<description>Meowth is a very unique Pokémon as it has many of the characteristics of a human. It walks on two feet, talks and is as smart as any human. Meowth is currently a member of Team Rocket and he travels around with Jessie and James trying to capture Pikachu and other rare Pokémon for Giovanni.
Meowth generally finishes his sentences with "Nyaa (ニャー)" which is the equivalent of "meow" in English. This helps people remember that despite his ability to talk like a human, he still has cat character traits.
Meowth is also known for coming up with his many schemes to try to capture Pikachu. While Jessie and James always agree with Meowth and think his plans are brilliant, they are generally foiled by Ash and his friends.
Long Con to Access Raimon City Pokémon Center
Meowth schemed with Jessie, James and Doctor Zager to figure out a way for them to infiltrate the Raimon City Pokémon Center where high-leveled Pokémon are stored in a vault that is protected by a security machine scan system that would only open if Nurse Joy (Isshu) or Nurse Joy`s Audino were scanned. Meowth pretended to be no longer part of Team Rocket making up a story that his made an error while executing a certain operation and when headquarters hear of his mistake, they told him he was fired.
Ash, Iris and Cilan believed him and allowed Meowth to travel with him. Pikachu though didn`t trust Meowth even though Meowth proved on numerous occasion that it should be trusted. Meowth`s plan was put into action when they arrived at the Raimon City Pokémon Center and as soon as Nurse Joy`s Audino was scanned to open the door, Meowth turned on Pikachu and the other and captured all the Pokémon in the vault. The long con had been a success and Meowth met up with Jessie and James below the Pokémon Center. Unfortunately, they weren`t able to get away as Ash and his friends realized that Meowth had just been conning them and they were able to stop Team Rocket.</description>

<description>James is one part of of the Team Rocket trio that follows around Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokémon anime, usually trying to steal Ash`s Pikachu, but always failing.
James is mostly a comedic parody of bishounen characters; the English dub in particular tends to give him a melodramatic and even campy tone. He is somewhat famous for carrying a rose, though in more recent episodes he does not display it often. Mostly, his rose is displayed in the Team Rocket motto.
The only child of millionaires, James was forced to endure formal society. At a young age, he was forcefully engaged to a girl of whom he was terrified, Jessiebelle, all because his parents wanted to have a wealthy daughter-in-law. Thus, he ran away from home, leaving behind his beloved pet Growlie. He attempted to enroll in Pokémon Tech, a trainer`s school, but, along with his new friend Jessie, flunked out. Then, with Jessie, he joined the Sunny Town bicycle gang, where he was popular for being the only gang member to have to use training wheels (nicknamed "Trainer Jim"). Eventually James, Jessie, and the bike gang went their separate ways.
Due to conflicts in canon between Kanto and Johto episodes and the special episode "Training Daze", what happened between James and Jessie after the bike gang is unknown. What is known, as shown in the special episode, is that they joined Team Rocket separately and were on initially unfriendly terms after being grouped with Meowth. However, they quickly made up and the rest is history.
Since he is proficient in several activities, including Pokémon haiku and PokéRinger, it is possible that he developed his skills during his temporary separation from Jessie, but this is not known for sure.
In the episode "Holy Matrimony!", James returned to his home as a result of a trap by his parents, who pretended to be dead. He was reunited with his old pet Growlie and managed to avoid marrying Jessiebelle. Growlie stayed behind when James returned to Jessie and Meowth.
James has a tendency to be swindled by a Magikarp Salesman, who has on many occasions tricked him into buying a Magikarp or other useless Pokémon and items for large sums of money.
James also has a tendency to cross-dress, but has not done it since "Pros and Con Artists". He does, however, dress up like famous celebrities as well, such as Professor Oak, Juan, and Norman.
James loves rare bottle caps and has an impressive collection of them. In the episode "All That Glitters!" it is revealed that he has "drunk enough soda pop to float an aircraft carrier".
For unknown reasons, he, Jessie and Meowth mostly use hot air balloons instead of faster ways of transportation. However in newer episodes the balloon is shown with `jets` attached to explain how they get from one place to another faster than walking.</description>

<description>The Beginning
Ash is the main character of the Pokémon anime. Raised in Pallet Town, he started his journey to become a Pokémon Master at the age of 10. On the day that he started his journey, Ash carelessly woke up late despite being told by his mother, Delia Ketchum to get to bed. He rushed to Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory only to find out that the beginner Pokémon - Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander - had already been given out to trainers who arrived on time. However, Professor Samual Oak mentioned that there was one more Pokémon available - Pikachu. Despite constantly hitting Ash with Electric-type attacks and refusing to return to its PokéBall, Ash decided to take Pikachu along with him on his journey to become a Pokémon Master. Pikachu is cold towards Ash at first and laughs at his failures; however, when Ash saves Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow, he begins to warm up to his new trainer and the two finally become friends. After the battle with the flock of Spearow, a Ho-Oh is seen flying towards a rainbow in the sky. The PokéDex reveals that the Ho-Oh is an unidentified Pokémon. Thus, the journey of Ash and Pikachu begins.
Captures in Viridian Forest
While making his way towards Pewter City and his first Kanto League Gym Battle, Ash came upon a wild Caterpie deep within Viridian Forest. Instead of using Pikachu to battle against the wild Pokémon, Ash took his chances and threw a PokéBall without weakining the Caterpie first. Luckily, he was able to catch the Pokémon without any trouble. The capture of Ash`s Caterpie marked Ash`s first capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Caterpie the second Pokémon to join his team.
The next day, while continuing the trek through the Viridian Forest, Ash came up on a wild Pidgeotto. He tried to just throw a PokéBall like he did with Ash`s Caterpie, but Pidgeotto swatted the PokéBall away. Misty informed that he must weaken the Pokémon first before attempting to capture it. He called out Ash`s Caterpie to battle against, but Misty quickly informed him that Bug-type Pokémon are weak against Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeotto. After Pidgeotto dealt significant damage to Ash`s Caterpie, Ash recalled it and sent out Pikachu. Pikachu was able to use its Thundershock to weaken Pidgeotto and allow Ash to capture it with a PokéBall. Thus, this capture marked Ash`s second capture as a Pokémon Trainer, making Ash`s Pidgeotto the third Pokémon to join his team.
Later on, while still in the Viridian Forest, Ash was approached by Team Rocket, who attempted to steal his Pokémon. After defeating Meowth, James`s Koffing, and Jessie`s Ekans, Ash`s Caterpie evolved into Ash`s Metapod.
Some of Ash`s greatest accomplishments have been at the various Pokémon Leagues. He was the victor at the Orange League and the Battle Frontier. He also competed in the Indigo League and the Johto Silver Conference where he placed admirably in both those competitions as well.
Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup
Ash participated in the Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup at the Kagome Town stadium. In the first round he was in the fifth match and faced off against Marris. The match was quickly showcased and Ash won the battle and advanced to the second round while Marris was eliminated from the tournament.
The Isshu League
Ash participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where he was matched up against Trip. Trip`s Serperior was sent out to battle Pikachu and Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior`s speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter Trip`s Serperior speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round. The two met in the Pokémon Center after the battle, and Trip vowed that the next time they met that he would win. The two shook hands and parted ways.
In the first main round, Ash`s opponent was shown on the match up electronic board but not much else is known about the battle. Ash`s Scraggy participated in the second main round of the Isshu League tournament where it faced off against a Darumakka. It was able to defeat it so that moved on to the next round.
In the third round, Stephan was matched up against Ash. Cilan noted that the two of them have a very direct taste and that it would be a good battle. It was only a 3 on 3 battle but the both of them gave it their all. The first two battles of the third round setup the final match up of Stephan`s Sawk vs Ash`s Krookodile, both of which were very injured from the previous battles. Both of them did their best to muster up their reserve strength but in the end a surprise move of Aerial Ace by Ash`s Krookodile was super effective against Stephan`s Sawk and it knocked it out to give Ash the victory while eliminating Stephan from the tournament. Stephan realized after the battle that the reason that Ash withdrew Waruvial after the first battle was because Ash knew that Stephan would definitely send out Dageki, so he didn`t reveal that it knew Aerial Ace and saved until the end.</description>

<description>The Beginning
On the morning that Ash was to start his Pokémon journey, he woke up late and by the time he reached Professor Samual Oak`s laboratory, all of the beginner Pokémon were already taken. However, Professor Samual Oak did have one Pokémon left, a wild Pikachu. At first, Pikachu did not like Ash and would refuse to enter his PokéBall. He would often laugh at Ash`s failures and refused to listen to him. However, after Ash proved his loyalty to Pikachu by protecting him from a flock of Spearow, and thus began to earn Pikachu`s trust and respect. The two have since become best friends and Pikachu never leaves Ash`s side.
Since the day Team Rocket first encountered Pikachu, it has been their sole goal to capture it. Day after day, their plan to capture Pikachu has been thwarted mainly due to Pikachu`s amazingly powerful Thunderbolt that keeps on blasting them off.
On numerous occasions, Pikachu has made it evident that he is happy being a Pikachu and has no desire to evolve into a more powerful Raichu. It has proven time and time again that it is a powerful and worthy opponent to any Pokémon that dares to battle it.
Gym Battle against Burgh`s Leavanny
Pikachu was then sent out to battle Burgh`s Leavanny. Burgh`s Leavanny managed to tie up Pikachu with String Shot but unlike Ash`s Swadloon who was able to break free, Pikachu ended up getting hit with a couple of Leaf Storm attacks and a Hyper Beam before it rolled into another of Burgh`s Leavanny`s Leaf Storm attacks to break the string off its body so it could attack. Freed from the String Shot, Burgh`s Leavanny tried to tie it up again but Pikachu managed to avoid it with its speed and then knocked Burgh`s Leavanny out with a combination of Iron Tail and Electro Ball.
Gym Battle against Elesa
Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy and was then matched up with Pikachu. Pikachu made quick work of Elesa`s Emolga and knocked it out with one attack, its Iron Tail.
Elesa`s Tynamo was the last Pokémon that she used in her gym battle against Ash. It was matched up against Pikachu who had just defeated her Emonga. Pikachu had a hard time defending against the fast Tackle attack that Elesa`s Tynamo kept hitting it with but Pikachu used its Thunderbolt to create a large dust cloud leaving only a small corridor for Pikachu to focus on it and so Elesa`s Tynamo couldn`t maneuver out of the way. Pikachu one hit K.O`d Elesa`s Tynamo with a Iron Tail. The loss gave Ash the overall victory.
Battle against Alder`s Bouffalant
Ash challenged Alder to a battle and he accepted though he had been walking all night and was actually quite tired. Alder sent out his Buffron to battle Pikachu but just as the battle started, Alder fell asleep standing up and didn`t give any orders to his Buffron. Alder`s Bouffalant stood still as Pikachu began hitting it with attack after attack until it Alder`s Bouffalant finally got mad at Alder and charged at him and set him flying into a tree. After that, Alder`s Bouffalant no longer wished to battle and Alder conceded the battle.
Gym Battle against Skyla
In Skyla air battle simulation, Ash`s Tranquill was matched up against Skyla`s Unfezant and since her Pokémon was the highest evolved form, she determined that her Pokémon would be the winner in that match-up. In the actual gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was up against Skyla`s Unfezant which was the match-up just after Ash`s Tranquill had defeated Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla`s Unfezant proved to be stronger and faster than Ash`s Tranquill, so Ash recalled it and set out Pikachu. Pikachu had a definite advantage over Skyla`s Unfezant with its electric attacks and it quickly knocked it out with its Electro Ball attack.
Ash Just after Pikachu ended up knocking out Skyla`s Unfezant, Skyla`s Swanna was sent out to battle against it. Skyla had been watching her grandpa`s battle videos and noticed that he used the move Aqua Ring to defend against Electric attacks. She used that same defense against Pikachu which nullified its Electric attacks. It`s Iron Tail also couldn`t hit it so high in the air. Ash then noticed the rings in the air and Pikachu jumped up on them and managed to hit Skyla`s Swanna but not directly. Pikachu was now up in the air though and Skyla`s Swanna had the advantage there and it quickly knocked Pikachu out with a powerful Brave Bird attack.
Battle Against Trip`s Serperior at the Isshu League
Pikachu participated in the Isshu League in the preliminary match where it is was matched up against Trip`s Serperior. Cilan noted that Trip`s Serperior speed and its attack power had leveled up quite a bit too since the last time they saw it. The match was pretty one sided for a long time as Pikachu wasn`t able to counter its speed and ended up getting wrapped up. After using Iron Tail on the ground to get loose, Pikachu used a combination attack of Iron Tail and Electro Ball to one hit KO Trip`s Serperior. As a result, Trip was eliminated from the Isshu League and Ash advanced to the next round.</description>

<description>He is a Pokémon researcher that was once a competitive Trainer, and is generally considered the best in his field. As such, his role in the Pokémon games and anime is that of a mentor to young Pokémon Trainers, a source of information and an occasional plot device. Amongst other things, he is credited with inventing the Pokédex. He also hands out a Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander to beginning trainers (depending on which Pokémon the trainer chooses) to start their adventure in the Kanto Region. Although he is an expert on all matters relating to Pokémon, Professor Oak specializes in Pokémon behavioural science. He appears in Pokémon 4Ever as a child who was pulled into the future by Celebi. Additionally, it is apparent after Pokémon 3: The Movie that he knew Delia Ketchum since she was a child; this most likely is the reason he occasionally exhibits parental-type concern (mainly in the form of scolding Ash as he is doing something that is dangerous). He also creates poems centred around Pokémon and is known as the rhyming professor by Dawn.</description>

<description>Charizard evolves from Charmeleon during a battle with Aerodactyl but still remains disobient to Ash.
Kanto Pokémon League:
Fifth Round - Vs Ritchie.
Ash gambled on using a disobient Charizard and he was trailing in the battle and his other Pokémon were tired.
Charizard originally appeared like it was not going to do anything but after Ritchie`s Charmander narrowly missed with a flamethrower, Charizard decided to fight back with a flamethrower of its own with panicked Charmander and forced Ritchie to recall it.
Pikachu was Ritchie`s third and final Pokémon in the battle and was against Ash`s Charizard which had just forced Charmander to be switched. Charizard trembled the ground with a couple of stomps making Pikachu lose its balance and then blew Pikachu away using a gust from its wings. Seemingly thinking Pikachu was not a worthy opponent, Charizard took a nap in the middle of a battle and despite Ash pleaded with it to battle, it was eliminated. This gave Sparky the victory over Charizard and put Ritchie into round six.
Ash angrily recalled Charizard into its ball.
Orange Islands.
Ash called upon Charizard to battle Tad`s Poliwrath which had a reputation of being a very strong Pokémon. Charizard refused to listen to Ash`s orders and Poliwrath shoots a water gun on Charizards tail making the flame much smaller, then a subsuquent Ice Beam hits Charizard and freezes it. The battle left Charizard very injured and Ash had to keep its tail flame alive much like he did when he first found it as a Charmander.
Despite an intial struggle, Charizard saw how much Ash cared for him and once it reached full health in the morning Charizard became friendly with Ash and even obeyed Ash during Battle.
Charizard then went on to defeat Tad`s Poliwrath in a re-match.
Orange League Final - Vs. Ash Ketchum (Sand Field)
Ash chose Charizard to battle against Electabuzz and ordered it to use Flamethrower against Electabuzz, who quickly jumped into the air and landed a Thunderpunch onto Charizard and follwowed up by shocking Charizard with an electric attack. Charizard managed to release himself from the electricity by firing a Fire Spin and then Charizard flew towards Electabuzz quickly making sure it could not use it Thunderbolt attack. Charizard got a good grip on Electabuzz and flew into the air and used Seismic Toss on it which eliminated it and left Drake with one Pokémon left.
Drake`s final Pokémon was his prized Dragonite who he sent out to battle Ash`s Charizard.
Charizard moved first by using a Flamethrower attack but Dragonite countered by using Water Gun which cuts through the Flamethrower and hits Charizard, who then takes to the skies whilst avoiding Dragonite`s Ice Beam.
Dragonite then takes to the sky itself showing great speed as it does so. Dragonite and Charizard exchange Ice Beam and Flamethrower attacks respectively but it is Dragonite who manages to clip Charizard wing using Ice Beam which send Charizard spinning to the ground. Charizard recovers and flies close to Dragonite in an attempt to use a Seismic Toss attack, however, Dragonite avoids and gets a good grip on Charizard which gives it the opportunity to use a Slam attack.
Charizard gets up quick although it is clearly tired but it has enough stength to launch a Dragon Rage attack. Dragonite uses the same move, the attacks collide and both Pokémon are sent flying backwards. When the dust settles both Pokémon are standing but exhausted from the previous battle, after a few deep breaths Charizard falls to the ground and is eliminated.
After Ash had won the battle against Drake he called out all of his Pokémon that participated in the battle on the stage as Drake presented him with the Winner`s Trophy. Then Ash, Pikachu, Tauros, Lapras, Squirtle, Bulbasaur and Charizard all had their handprints set in stone to be remembered in the Orange Island Hall of Fame.</description>

<description>Erika is the Gym Leader of Celadon Gym located in the heart of Celadon City. Trainers that defeat her in a gym battle are awarded the Rainbow Badge as proof of defeating her. She specializes in Grass-type Pokémon as well as selling and making perfumes.
As well as running her gym, she also runs a perfume store nearby where she is the manager. Erika believes that perfume has the effects of relaxing people`s moods, invigorating them and healing their hearts. When Ash entered her perfume store and mocked it as just a means of making guys fawn over girls, he was kicked out of the store and then later out of the Celadon Gym as well. She instructed her subordinates to not allow him to enter the gym because of his perfume remarks.
Essence of Gloom
Team Rocket heard about a legendary perfume that is made in the Celadon Gym and attempted to steal it. They tricked Ash into working with them so they could enter the gym undetected. They ended up destroying the Celadon Gym in a large fire before they stole what they thought was the formula but instead it was Gloom extract which is used as raw material for perfume.
Gym Battle with Ash
Since Ash was banned from the gym, he couldn`t challenge Erika to a battle. He snuck in disguised as a girl and called himself `Ashley` (Sato-chan). Pikachu realized it was him and since he was discovered he challenged Erika to a battle on the spot which she accepted. She setup the battle as a 3-on-3 but the battle was never fully completed. Her Tangela was sent out first and it managed to defeat Ash`s Bulbasaur with a Stun Spore, which paralyzed it. Realizing that his Grass on Grass battle technique wasn`t working against Erika, Ash sent out his Charmander. Erika then told Ash she`d give him a Paralyze Heal after the battle which showed her loving and compassionate side. Erika`s Weepinbell was sent out second to counter Ash`s Charmander but its Flamethrower proved to be too much for it.
In the final matchup, Erika`s Gloom was sent out to battle Ash`s Charmander and Ash`s Charmander couldn`t stand the horrid smell of Erika`s Gloom and was recalled. Pikachu was going to be matched up with it for the final round of the battle but Team Rocket exploded a bomb in the gym and it caught fire. Everyone except Erika`s Gloom escaped safely, so Ash decided to go in after it as he thought he was partially responsible for the disaster. As thanks for rescuing her Gloom, Erika gave Ash the Rainbow Badge.</description>

<gender>none/does not apply</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Marshadow is a dual-type Fighting/Ghost Mythical Pokémon.
It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
Marshadow is a humanoid Pokémon that appears to be made of smoky gray shadows. The area around its face resembles headgear, such as a helmet. On top of the helmet are two curled horns or ears with a wispy horn between them. Its eyes are orange-red with yellow pupils, and above each eye is a yellow, oval marking. Each arm has a small bump on the wrist. Around its neck is a smoky collar and there is a trail of shadows on each foot.
When angered or attacking, such as using its exclusive Z-Move, Marshadow`s fighting spirit will begin to burn, causing it to become Zenith Marshadow. In this state, its headgear, wrist bumps, and collar flare up and resemble green and yellow flames. Marshadow`s eyes also flare up when in this state, but do not change in color.
Very few people have seen it, so its existence was the stuff of legends and myths. A cautious Pokémon, Marshadow sinks into the shadows to ensure it is not noticed while it observes its surroundings. While in hiding in the shadows of others, it can understand their feelings and copies their abilities. Through mimicry, it will eventually become more powerful than those it imitates. As seen in the anime, Marshadow is also capable of causing nightmares. Marshadow is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Spectral Thief and exclusive Z-Move Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike.</description>
