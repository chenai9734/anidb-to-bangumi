<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="530122">Surprisingly good, recommended for school life/daily life/romance fans.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="171408">Started off a comedy and fell into moral lessons for grade schoolers. No more body exchange, no jokes. This is show about anger control and how to understand each other.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="522616">The first arc is very interresting and good, but after a while it just "loses" the magic. At the end I felt like Britney Spears was doing a monologue, "friends forever and shit, but still..." They could just tie thing up and finish the story, but no... cliffhanger!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="423521">one of my favorite anime at last season .......... but i need second seasonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="401111">What a great series.  No giant mecha, no sappy unreal love polygons, just real friends figuring out their very real (and very strange) problems together.  For such a simple premise, the series was exceedingly entertaining.  I would highly recommend it, but I will not go so far as to say its a "must see" unless you like others like it... wait, ARE there others like it?  Hmmm.... Heartseed! C`mere!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="717410">This was just simply enjoyable. Very realistic, decent plot, great character development (plays into the realism), likable protagonist (and antagonist actually). Overall, it was just pleasant to watch. I would definitely recommend this anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="408979">i though in my first time watch this anime (episode 1).
i think this anime won`t last long in my watching list... but when story goes by... i think i`m really like the story and plot... about friendship and other think...
recommended for you who like friendship story :D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="369649">Started out with a really good premise (body exchanging), but lately I feel this show is losing the same drive of the earlier episodes. Mainly due to the shitty protagonist. Watch for Himeko and Iori, and if you want a decent school romance/comedy/angsty show.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="260717">The first arc (5 episodes?) are quite amazing. However, after that it loses its novelty and has an arbitrary, deus-ex-machina style story telling that quickly makes you lose the amazing first impression it gives you. Still, the first 5 episodes are quite an experience! Definitely recommended.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="84998">Good character drama with a fairly interesting god-like cosmic catalyst that unfortunately goes unexplained to the end. I won`t say it`s "must see", but you won`t (or shouldn`t) be bored by it, unless character dramas in general bore you.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="524477">First episode was just ok, but now after 5 episodes the story is just amazing, moving. Just watch it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="537553">Awesome, awesome, fucking awesome show. And Inaba FTW, this girl`s character grew on me so much so fast, I just love it, and she`s even voiced by one of my favourite voice actors, it fits perfectly. 
Anyway, the anime is pretty good, suspensefull, tear jerking and heart warming while maintaining the tense atmosphere, it strikes the balance so well that I have to say it`s a must see. At the very least it`s worth checking out.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="394403">Amazing concept extremely unique and addicting! must see this it makes you wonder...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="308099">If you want to try something with a decent plot yet still very exciting then I`ll highly recommend this series! This is very exciting and fun to watch, and this series kept me in my seat through the whole episodes without even a break so I`ll say it`s very exciting!
And despite being a very short series (which is actually very regrettable), the characters also develops through the series so its fun (and heart warming) to watch!
**HIGHLY RECOMMENDS**</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="556929">Cool anime, Touched feeling and many more. one of my favorite anime. rather more episode show in this anime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="268122">Seriously Kororo Connect is one of the shows that you see one every 5 years or so. A Must see . The story, music and animation are all terrific. 
And why the hell its rate only 7??!!! 
If you ask me it should be 8.5-9</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="409046">First, Inaba was awesome (both the character, and voice actor)... Also, BEWARE, since its not only 13 episodes long as its appear here. There are 4 more episodes, which are important, since those give a proper ending. Also, i was really glad with Taichi`s decision in the last episode.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="133308">Instant addiction.

Character based romance, driven by a fantasy manipulation setting. Does the setting matter? Hardly. It`s an instant addiction.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="730431">Nice animation, charming music, great story and character development, memorable characters, and realistic. First I little bit hesitate to watch this because some review from another site but after I brace myself to watch in the end there is no regret at all. In fact this is the first time in my life it felt so great after watching an anime series. Its like a roller coaster of emotion, so entertaining, and enlightening.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="491976">The premise and characters are interesting and developed very well. The drama (while slightly overblown at times) is touching in all the right ways. It`s a must see!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="463203">Romance, relationships, drama, thriller, life, inspirational.. A must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="556226">Totally awesome anime!! The characters, story line, is awesome. The love-polygon is awesome!! Just hope this anime will have second season, with additional CRC members.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="247391">I have just finished ep5 and it is getting better and better!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="65687">Every once in a great while an anime comes along that is so different that it breaks the mold and makes you want to put it in its own genre. Every so often one comes along that is not just a good story but is elevated to important literature, something that can change the way you look at the world. Kokoro Connect is at once both of these things. I give it a must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="471611">i watched the 5th episode today and felt a strong thing after a long time, a feeling</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="77207">Great anime, it`s all about the characters interacting among themselves and with others, with a "slight" supernatural twist.
Don`t be fooled though, the series has 17 episodes and the plot has nice closure. Not sure why the last 4 episodes are listed separately, they`re not "specials", they`re fully fledged parts of the story.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="375849">When the series only started I wasn`t too sure about whether I should watch it or not,but then one day I was kinda bored and decided to check it out just to kill some time. After watching first 3 episodes in a row to say that I liked it means to say nothing at all! The feeling of "craving for more" usually comes at the end of the series,but with that magnificent ending timed very accurately on every episode it`s just bursting out like saying - "Common,what goes next? When is the next episode?!". 
Definitely this has become one of my favorite series of all times,and if You like romantic stories with a bit of sci-fi(body swap) and a spice of comedy,then you just MUST SEE this series. Other than that I`d recommend it to everybody.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="26844">So far (ep10), it`s been a very good anime. The story`s great, it`s well presented, and it does an excellent job at stirring your emotions.

Constantly gets me craving for more. A must-see.</recommendation>

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<name>school clubs</name>
<description>Even though school clubs in Japan are not mandatory, there is some pressure from the social grid (e.g. fellow students, teachers) to participate in some kind of after-school activity, be it in sports or arts. Colleges also have clubs.
As a comedy element in anime, some students have joined too many clubs, and are thus constantly stressed out. There is also the element of social commentary, making it clear that you have to join a club, if you want to be part of the class. Since self-founded clubs need at least 3 members, the desperate search and advertising for new members can be cause for hilarity in anime.</description>

<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>comedy</name>
<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>school life</name>
<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<name>coming of age</name>
<description>In the strict sense the Coming of age describes a young person`s transition from adolescence to adulthood. In anime the term is used in a more general sense where the protagonists have to face a challenge, make an important decision in their life, take on responsibility, or learn a lesson, and by overcoming these obstacles they reach a higher level of maturity.</description>

<name>introspection</name>
<description>The characters in this anime do not walk through life simply accepting how they are, but quite on the contrary constantly try to understand their own motives, feelings and reactions to the other protagonists. 
This self-searching included the questions: "Who am I?", "What makes me tick?", "What do I want?", "What do others expect of me?", etc.</description>

<name>family without father</name>
<description>For some reason the protagonists father is no longer among the living. The much too early death was due to sickness or accident.
This plot device adds a certain degree of tragedy to the anime and usually has repercussions on the rest of the family: Possibly the grieve-stricken mother and children barely function as humans. Or adding emphasis to the overall financial predicament of the family, should the father have been the money earner.</description>

<description>A person`s body is taken over by some foreign intelligence. It`s not brainwashing, because they still have control of their own mind — but that`s all they have. Either they`ve been reduced to a spectator in their own body, or their soul has been booted out of their body entirely. Either way, the rest of the cast will soon find he`s not himself.</description>

<name>body exchange</name>
<description>Two or more characters swap bodies (or, equally, swap minds).
When this plot is done, usually the voices also switch as narrative cheat to help viewers keep track of who`s who. More subtly, it`s just the eyes. More serious/action-oriented shows might not do this. The Flip often involves characters of different ages, genders, races, or social classes. Another variation is a protagonist and antagonist switching, which usually involves each trying to undermine the other`s organization while simultaneously trying to switch back. If one or both of the characters have superpowers or other special abilities, they`ll have a lot of trouble figuring their new powers out.</description>

<name>ensemble cast</name>
<description>A show with an ensemble cast focuses on a larger group of main characters in a single plot narrative; anime containing several segmented plot narratives (such as episodic or arc-based plots) are excluded. As such, it doesn`t really have a "main" or "lead" character; instead, every member of the central main character group plays an important part in the show`s grander scheme; no single character is more important or prominent than the others (equality of importance). Further, subplots (if any) lead by each character in the ensemble have equal weighting in importance (or lack of weight).

* In a show where no single main character is more important or prominent than the others, 4+ main characters is almost always an ensemble cast.
* A show with 3 main characters of equal importance is likely also an ensemble cast; equality of importance must be considered carefully.
* A show with 2 main characters of equal importance is generally not an ensemble cast situation; however, on an exception basis where neither main character is considered an antagonist, a 2-main-character anime may be considered an ensemble (e.g. http://anidb.net/a11829 [Kimi no Na wa.]).

<name>i got a crush on you</name>
<description>It happens when a person develops an interest in someone that seems mysterious, smart, sexy, cute, fun, etc. Basically just someone you would like to spend more time with. Crushes are usually one sided and they happen more frequently among middle and high school students.
A person with a crush usually has a hard time expressing or conveying his/her feelings to that other person. That other person is usually clueless of the situation. Sometimes that person knows about the crush, but feels annoyed or embarrassed by it for some reason.
Having a crush on someone does not mean you are in love with that person, at least not yet. Depending on the situation crushes could develop differently (for better or worse):
1) Larger scale interactions (love).
2) Dating relationships.
3) Scary obsession or stalker type situations.
4) Disappear over time or distance.</description>

<description>Term used to refer to a person who takes on the role of their opposite gender. This often only reaches to the extent of cross-dressing (involving physical appearance and clothing only), but in rarer cases, involves a total gender swap (which seems to be more common in anime) - where the willing or unwilling victim receives a body opposite of their original gender (either permanently or temporarily), with all natural parts per their new body fully (or just all-out amply) included.
Example of cross-dressing gender bender: "Maria+Holic"
Examples of body-swap gender bender: "Kashimashi: Girl meets Girl", "Birdy the Mighty Decode"</description>

<description>When a foreign entity like that of a symbiote, body snatcher, puppeteer parasite, or even a hacker (when regarding machines like robots and computers) enters/outright hijacks a body, the possessed subject becomes what is usually called: the host.
The basic purpose of the host varies on what the point was for it to have been hijacked in the first place. Sometimes it`s used as a disguise, other times it`s used as a decoy and destraction, even simply being used as a weapon and piece of armor that the possessor uses to cause sheer chaos and destruction, but sometimes... a host can be used for fetish fuel.</description>
