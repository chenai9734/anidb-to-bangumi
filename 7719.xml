<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="464539">great story</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="22771">It`s cliché the girl starts of wirth an selfish attitude and the guy is demoted to errand boy and what`s with the pipe? maybe the adventures of the female sherlock holmes is a better title lol</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="110702">you don`t need a "wellspring of wisdom" to figure out the mysteries, but it was overall a good anime to watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="428654">One of the great anime in 2011. Give it a watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="161421">A great show, unfortunately  you just hope the boy "Kujou" will shut up so that you can enjoy it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="496985">Quite the interesting story, it keeps you coming back for more if you like any sort of mystery type anime, mind you the mysteries aren`t too mysterious. With a typical but still enjoyable love story too. All in all, good anime worth a watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="377114">The artwork and the stile was very enjoyable and the music is awsome. The story could have been more complex but all and all a very good anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="455302">One of the very few that have the touch of creativity in what they want to show. Although the mysteries were not total sherlock kinds, they had a very good back story. I really loved the episode where Victorique solves the Queen`s case. All the mystery unraveling during the play (thats creativity!). At least it impressed me. Overall good watch. Just don`t mind the annoying `victoriicaa` calls by the male protoganist (as `bullshit` pointed out) and you`ll enjoy it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="460550">If you get past kind of boring first eps (and get used to annoying parts of characters) You`ll be surprised, how good this anime actually is.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="507788">This one is worth your time.  There are a few interesting mysteries early on, and the growth of the relationship of the two main characters is entertaining/touching.  If the testy and/or annoying behaviors of the principal characters don`t bother you too much right off, just know that those things don`t worsen in any significant way as it goes on.  The show decides to get serious about the war plot in the last 1/3 of the series, which works fine.  I was sorry to see this anime end.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="618076">when I watched this anime, the first thing I can say is kujo is the typical "super moron" male protagonist which you want to kill &amp; MUST die in the first episode (a super moron based on his action, when you carefully think about it, especially in episode 5) moreover, he also talks big and can`t read the situation at all (proved in episode 3 &amp; episode 5), other than that, it`s a pretty good anime. After watching this anime, I wondered "why many animation production in Japan loves to add a moron male protagonist like this?" (many good anime that I watch have similar moron male protagonist like kujo)

other than that, nothing is wrong with this anime

well. because of how moron Kujo was, I can only give 7/10 for this anime (kujo deducted 2 points `cuz of his moron trait)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="443903">Epic detective series, has drama, slight comedy and romance... the only bad thing about it is that Victorique solves some puzzles "too" quickly sometimes.. Better watch each arc in a single setting or you won`t know what is going on. (Happened to me while watching 1 episode every week)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="538829">A Japanese transfer student in a fictional European nation becomes embroiled in mystery, romance, and political intrigue when he meets Victorique, a strange girl who spends most of her time in a tower library at school.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="422859">Make no mistake, this is not a show about solving mysteries. It`s about using your superpowers to overcome impossible odds. And yet, this is how I feel anime should be, instead of average guys amassing a following of fangirls. Do keep this in mind and don`t lump Gosick with shows like Detective Conan. You`ll find it much more enjoyable that way.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="334976">fantastic anime!! really worth watching.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="492628">Such a wonderful tale, funny at times but also dramatic.
Not every one enjoys these kind of anime but for me it was brilliant. Mystery with hints of romance and a happy ending. The animations and voice action is very good, the main characters fabulous.
Must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="493280">Must see just for Vitorique and Yuuki Aoi voicing her. My last 10 vote in 5 years</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="392207">dark, complex, thrilling, AWESOME.... the best detective anime I ever watch....</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="163989">This is definitely a wonderful series, and highly recommend watching it for those that haven`t yet. I`m going to miss this show. It`s one of those shows you really don`t want to see end but has ended quite nicely for the main characters of the series.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="299976">Very interesting series, filled with action, suspense and some romance. The plot`s well done, so every piece fits together and creates a bigger picture. Seeing that it`s a balanced series in terms of content, anyone should be able to enjoy it, so don`t be fooled by the description/tags and watch it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="600241">Must see, it´s a masterpiece</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="526839">Gosick does a very commendable job of being a story about mystery, adventure and romance within a realistic Victorian setting of the 1920`s , and does well to avoid certain tropes within the school life genre. Although the plot may thin out at times, and the character development can be seen as a bit slow for the context, it has excellent continuity and does an excellent job in wrapping up the story in non-generic manner. 
Honestly I was surprised at the amount of careful thought put into certain aspects of this anime, including the french writing, artwork and detective mysteries. 
Not perfect, but ignore a few faults here and there and it`s an outstanding show.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="440498">Very pleasant to watch, the art is very nice. Don`t remember much of the story actually, but that doesn`t bother me. Look at other recommendations.
Might be the best of loli detectives.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="400284">I just can recommend this Anime, I love this character of Victorique de Blois, and it`s in my opinion one of the best Anime of this Season. It`s a really good story and I hope I won`t be gutted at the following episodes. I`ll buy the Light Novel at half of the Anime, maybe also after the next episode :D .</recommendation>

<name>detective</name>
<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>alternative past</name>
<description>An anime that takes place in an alternative past is an anime that clearly does not belong to the future or the present, and isn`t tied particularly closely to our history, or has ties to our history but only as a premise: there are too many things that don`t make sense for the time-period. In some cases there is futuristic technology present, but the overall setting still feels that of the past. However the setting must still take place on Earth, since we can not know if the history of a fantasy world is an alternate one or not.</description>

<description>The Victorian era of British history was the period of Queen Victoria`s reign from 20 June 1837 until her death on 22 January 1901. The Victorian Era style of clothing, however, ended in 1912. It was a long period of peace, prosperity, refined sensibilities and national self-confidence for Britain. Some scholars date the beginning of the period in terms of sensibilities and political concerns to the passage of the Reform Act 1832.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<name>adventure</name>
<description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.</description>

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

<name>war</name>
<description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

Feelings of any kind towards other characters are best shown by calling each other`s name, loud, REALLY LOUD. For better effect at least twice or thrice.

<name>Victorique de Blois</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Victorique is the heroine of the story. She has the appearance of a small (4`7"), almost doll-like, girl with long golden hair and emerald eyes and a voice that sounds exactly like that of an older woman. Another important part of Victorique`s appearance is a pipe that she uses when thinking about something. She spends her days at the conservatory at the top of the library, reading several difficult books, often in different languages, simultaneously. She points at one wall of the library and has told Kazuya that she has read almost all the books over there. Along with her sharp tongue, abusive bluntness and eccentric attitude, she possesses amazing detective skills. After Victorique saves him from a near-arrest, Kazuya finds himself being entangled in every new mystery. Because her mother was a mistress, and according to Victorique "a dangerous person", she was imprisoned in the depths of the de Blois mansion where she developed very un-childlike mannerisms. She was sent off to school under strict orders to never leave the campus (although Grevil sometimes obtains special permission to take her out). When she first met Kazuya she didn`t like him and thought that he was annoying and stupid for climbing up all the stairs in the library. She even ignored him and made fun of him, but gradually warmed up to him and began to trust and cherish him. She enjoys "reconstructing chaos" and often complains of the boredom that causes her headaches. She is called "The Gray Wolf" by Grevil and was misunderstood at one time by Kujou as the "The Golden Fairy of the High Tower".</description>

<description>Kujou Kazuya is the main character of the story. As the youngest son of a soldier, he has spent most of his life struggling with living in his highly successful siblings` shadows. Jealous of all the attention his brothers got, he worked hard to compete, but everything changed when he understood that adults, who think that the youngest child is always spoiled and useless, will never acknowledge his efforts. With a permanent scar in his heart he left the military academy in Japan and before anyone from his family could stop him, went to study abroad to St. Marguerite. Unfortunately, his appearance, combined with the student body`s belief that "the traveler who comes in the spring brings death with him" has resulted in Kazuya being called the "Reaper" and having no friends. By some twist of fate he becomes a messenger and companion to the most eccentric pupil in the school, Victorica. At first he didn`t like Victorica because of her arrogant attitude, but after some time he started to care for her and be protective of her. He is described, by Victorica, as a good and sincere person whose soul is pure and beautiful enough to admit pride. Despite everything that happened in Japan he is proud to be a soldier`s son.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Avril is an international student from Great Britain. Because she and Kazuya were both from abroad, they quickly found common ground and were able to talk freely. A beautiful girl with short blond hair and blue eyes. It is hinted that she has feelings for Kazuya. She represents Kazuya`s ordinary ties to the school, apart from his adventures with Victorique. Despite Kazuya spends most of his time with either, Victorique and Avril never meet in person.
The real Avril Bradley was kidnapped on the way to the academy and replaced by Keiran II, the succesor of the famous thief Keiran. This thief wishes to continue his legacy by stealing the priceless works of famous artists and writers, etc., and was after a rare stamp that Avril`s grandfather, a famed adventurer, had intended to give to her. She was rescued by Kujo, and later in the nurses office said she thought he was a black-haired prince.</description>
