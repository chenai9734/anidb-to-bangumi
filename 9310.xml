<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="139011">After seeing 3 of them all I can say is "bloody good"</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="305901">The series is not without its failures, as it begins with a rather inexplicable premise - however as the story refocuses in the latter half of the season, it matures and develops depth and a sense of reflectiveness rarely seen in this form of media. Overall, the team behind this work really came through in bringing out not only the charm of unusually complex stereotypes, but also the oft-incongruencies of motive and action in a social setting.
In my opinion, the protagonist does not exemplify pessimism - but more of a practical humanist who is, for the time being and without explicit explanation, self-loathing. (again, contrasting with what he reveals to others)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="47809">It has a slow start, but becomes interesting after Ep 3-4. 
Very enjoyable.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="683896">Deep, tormenting and hilariously funny.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="28277">This series shines the brightest when it is being a parody of various light novel romcom tropes (especially Haganai), but tends to fall short when it`s trying to be serious.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="477898">I really enjoyed the MC and the way the show presents his thoughts in a stream of consciousness manner. Very rarely do we get to hear such pessimistic, intelligent and clever narration, it`s almost akin to hearing Kyon from Haruhi quip on about something in his head (Similarities end there though). 

The show which is practically a study on the socology of loners, does a good job of showing off the characters personalities, but the show doesn`t do a whole lot to show the two main loners changing. And for that matter, neither of the supporting characters who were supposedly helped, got any real resolution either. 
Lots of stories without any conclusions.

Still, the MCs are multifaceted with lots of unique qualities that make them very likable. The pessimistic outlook with a sense of humor is a hard point of view to pull off, but this show does a great job, and I can never tire of it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="267227">Enjoyable to the very last episode. I want more. I hope there`s gonna be a second season. Being this anime so good I`m sure there`s gonna be a 2nd season</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="602436">this show will present you with a lot of cliche situations that you can find in every Romantic comedy anime on this planet, but the main character will deconstruct them all (rather harshly, I might add) 

if you want a narrator that`s similar to Kyon from Haruhi, this show got you fixed. Hachiman is basically Kyon if Kyon said the things he thought out loud (and he also a bit of an as*hole). 

the main character alone was enough to make me want a second season. the only reason this show isn`t a must watch is because the original material isn`t over yet, and thus, the ending did`t feel like an ending.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="170697">Really enjoyable story! Good love comedy and character development. Must see!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="383243">totally not what i`m expected to see, but that`s made this anime even better.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="379737">Great anime...i really enjoyed it !)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="434710">Unexpectedly good. Refreshing dialogue with awesome protagonist.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="319333">I must say, at the beginning I was like "what is this?" but the more you watch this anime the more you get sucked into it. 

I truly recommend this one, I believe that this can be enjoyed by most =).</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="203241">Maybe the best anime ever. Picture a social misfit, like Satou Tatsuhiro from NHK, with the inteligence of Oreki Houtarou, from Hyouka. Now fit him in a romantic comedy. Yeah, not romantic at all, and quite depressing. And yet, the aftermath is amazing! Also, the social aspects of school life through the eyes of Hachiman are quite compeling.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="333550">Very good one. A masterpiece. Watch it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="318709">Best drama love story anime ever just like this</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="727529">now this one is a surprise - and i`m talking about both seasons here. it`s painfully realistic, and in case it`ll resonate with your views and emotions - it`ll leave you stunned.

it may seem like a comedy, but it`s way, way deeper than that.</recommendation>

<description>"With my luck there will be no rom in my rom-com..." — Hachiman
The introverted high school student named http://anidb.net/ch50695 [Hikigaya Hachiman] has a very pessimistic view on life, even though he is ranked third in his grade. Not that he has much else to make him an optimist: no friends, no girlfriend, and when people ask him about his future dreams, he replies "out of order".
The modern literature teacher and guidance counsellor, http://anidb.net/ch51430 [Hiratsuka Shizuka], appalled by Hachiman`s outlook on life, gets him to join the Volunteers Club which happens to be run by one of the school`s best known and intelligent girls, http://anidb.net/ch50694 [Yukinoshita Yukino], also known as The Ice Queen. She is driven to excel and believes it is the duty of the exceptional to help the lost lambs of the world.
So will Hachiman be one of the lost lambs that Yukino helps, or will his teenage love comedy turn out just as he expected: SNAFU?</description>

<name>detective</name>
<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.

<name>trap</name>
<description>A trap is a plot device where a male character is mistaken for a female, with the intention of sexually deceiving other characters and/or the viewer. This behavior does not need to be intentional by the male (it is often not intentional) or continually maintained by the male, but the occurrence is common enough to deserve this fetish-specific tag.
This is often achieved by portraying the male character as a female; primarily via their clothing and physical appearance, but also through his behaviour, and/or language. A male character misinterpreted by others as female, without action from the male (explicitly feminine dress or behaviour), is generally not considered a trap; instead they are likely just http://anidb.net/t2561 [androgynous].
The reverse case is known as a http://anidb.net/t1637 [reverse trap].

<name>horny nosebleed</name>
<description>In Japanese media, healthy young men who have no other sexual outlet will often suffer nosebleeds upon seeing the naked female body, or even just a pair of well-filled panties.
The nosebleed is, of course, a visual shorthand/euphemism for sexual arousal. It is commonly interpreted that way for males and females, with little trickles of blood indicating mild arousal, and gushing fountains of blood indicating erection/extreme arousal in both sexes. It can also be interpreted as shorthand strictly for erections in males. In that case, when blood shoots from the nose explosively, and in ridiculous quantity, the implication would be an ejaculation.

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Even though school clubs in Japan are not mandatory, there is some pressure from the social grid (e.g. fellow students, teachers) to participate in some kind of after-school activity, be it in sports or arts. Colleges also have clubs.
As a comedy element in anime, some students have joined too many clubs, and are thus constantly stressed out. There is also the element of social commentary, making it clear that you have to join a club, if you want to be part of the class. Since self-founded clubs need at least 3 members, the desperate search and advertising for new members can be cause for hilarity in anime.</description>

Manga, comics, or visual novels do not fit this description and are not considered novels; including a small number of illustrations, however, is still permissible, which means that light novels are considered novels.</description>

<name>Asia</name>
<description>Asia is Earth`s largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometers, about 30% of Earth`s total land area and 8.7% of the Earth`s total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

<name>comedy</name>
<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>school life</name>
<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>antihero</name>
<description>An antihero is a main character in a story who lacks conventional heroic qualities and attributes such as idealism, courage and morality. Although antiheroes may sometimes perform actions that are morally correct, it is not always for the right reasons, often acting primarily out of self-interest or in ways that defy conventional ethical codes.
A villain protagonist is where the leading character of the story (the protagonist) is also a villain; this is a fairly rare occurrence.</description>

<description>Social commentary is the act of rebelling against an individual, or a group of people by rhetorical means. This is most often done with the idea of implementing or promoting change by informing the general populace about a given problem and appealing to people’s sense of justice. (Source: Wikipedia)&#13;

<name>season</name>
<description>A season is a division of the year, marked by changes in weather, ecology, and hours of daylight. Seasons result from the yearly orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth`s rotational axis relative to the plane of the orbit. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth`s surface, variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.
During May, June, and July, the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun. The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December, January, and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere.
In temperate and subpolar regions, four calendar-based seasons (with their adjectives) are generally recognized: spring (vernal), summer (estival), autumn (autumnal), fall and winter (hibernal). Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring (prevernal) and late summer (serotinal) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four.
