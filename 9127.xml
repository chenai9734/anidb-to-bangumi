<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="236243">It`s Minority Report meets Ghost in the Shell. If that sounds good to you, give it a watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="473733">Personally, I wouldn`t want to compare this with GITS.
So far, 4 episodes... the story depth/seriousness is shallow.
It felt so.... decent. The overall characters are too weak. Personality is weak. The society/community doesn`t seem solid and it doesn`t give a great atmosphere.
Overall, it wasn`t a great piece of art. For 4 episodes of course.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="243361">if u liked ghost in the shell, blade runner and judge dredd u must watch this anime :&amp;gt;</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="320398">If it was like GIDS I woul`ve gotten shivers.It`s mediocore for now.Weak female leads are nothing like Kusanagi, but still watchable.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="246307">+1 Drullo321 There is only a few that are a miss.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="272736">similar to ghost in the shell but doesnt posses the epicness which gits did. also when antagonist character is more interesting and lovable than protagonist  its makes u wonder, "why did good guys won?". still anime makes u think about what would u do if u lived in such society model. Recommended cause it takes on a futuristic society model which isnt out of reach and the consequences of it. Also fight scene are quite good, yet few.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="523721">This anime is really incredible. Story, setting, animation, soundtrack, awesome villain. What else do you need?</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="105473">Recommended
Some thriller is nice once in a while</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="127948">In the end this is what IG does best: high quality sci-fi thrillers. For the first 5 episodes Psycho-Pass is merely interesting, but starting with episode 6 the story really takes a delightfully dark turn that draws strong parallels with how the laughing man was introduced in GITS SAC. It suddenly got really interesting and if this keeps up, the show has really managed to change my perception of it for the better.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="581781">Pretty interesting and original sci-fi series. There is plenty of direct and inderect quotations in it, from such different sources as, for example, the Bible, "The Silence of the Lambs" and Ortega-and Gasset. Definitely worth seeing.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="192559">I haven`t seen a satisfying cyberpunk thriller story since Ghost in the Shell. It keep me interested with each episode and quite satisfying ending, make me looking forward if they decided to make another season.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="560966">Futuristic dystopia where every citizen is assigned a crime coefficient, and latent criminals with high crime coefficients are instantly taken down.  Very interesting premise and self-reflective on the nature of society.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="93358">Richly imagined cyberpunk dystopia that seems to blend aspects of Aldous Huxley`s Brave New World and Philip K. Dick`s Minority Report with a dash of cyberpunk sensibility loosely inspired by Ghost in the Shell. If this sounds good to you, by all means give it a spin!  The weak and indecisive female lead isn`t as bad as others here seem to make her out to be: I think they made Tsunemori as different as possible from GitS`s Major Kusanagi partly to avoid any such comparisons. Also, it gives Tsunemori space to grow as a character as the story progresses. All in all I like the direction this show is taking.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="307450">True Story.If episode 11 finished in any other possible way  than it does , i truly would drop this anime. Best anime since long time and at least best for 2012 for sure.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="413731">This show is cool, it has a great setting and it reminds me of 2 of my favorite shows Witch Hunter Robin and Ghost in the Shell, this show is a must see for those who like the 2 show I mentioned above.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="559673">this anime is just awesome!it is a must see for those who loves dark anime like me!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="240447">A must-see for the year 2012-2013.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="574906">The story is amazing, there are times that I don`t watch a sci-fi as good!! A futuristic theme, complex, is surely a "must see" for  2012-2013.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="48697">8 episodes in, this looks like a solid contender for best anime of the year.
Been a while since dark future was made this engaging.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="726703">Good story, great setting, great characters and excellent animation.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="328236">The characters have unique personalities, the plot is developed in an exquisite way. Moreover, the music and the design are perfect for the series.
I think this is one of those rare series that age well. Just like GITS or Cowboy Bebop (couldn`t help but find the protagonist very similar in his looks to Spike).</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="473646">AOTY2012.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="608677">As everyone has said, if you like Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, you`ll probably like this. Very high production values, cool technology, very much cyberpunk-inspired. The plot is intricate and surprising, even if it`s a little silly in places. The character development is a little thin, like in GitS SAC, but no more than you`d expect from an action thriller, and you still end up rooting for the badass protag. It has a few really awesome moments you`ll never forget.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="523684">As of today (i mean after episode 16) this anime is really amazing. Definitely a must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="234392">The concept and character build-up is great! Female mc is bad-ass, characters are lovable, and a smart antagonist to boot.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="470521">noitaminA at its best</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="94967">It has its flaws but the way it is constructed intentionally or unintentionally has a thought provoking potential. Thought on value of law, order and other weird things. And while these thoughts are perhaps not as deep as one would wish, if one were to judge it as a work of philosophy rather than fiction, nevertheless it`s far more than any anime before or after it has achieved to the best of author`s knowledge (of some 1000 anime, no less), hence a masterpiece this is.</recommendation>

<description>In the future, it is possible to quantitatively measure a person`s emotions, desires, and every inclination. In this way, it is also possible to measure a person`s criminal tendency factor, which is used to judge criminals.
This is the story of a team of policemen dedicated to maintaining public order. Some of them work in the Enforcement Division, responsible for the apprehension of criminals, while others belong to the Supervisory Division which oversees their colleagues in Enforcement.

<name>detective</name>
<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

<name>dystopia</name>
<description>A dystopia (from Ancient Greek: δυσ-, "bad, ill", and Ancient Greek: τόπος, "place, landscape"; alternatively cacotopia, or anti-utopia) is, in literature, an often futuristic society that has degraded into a repressive and controlled state, often under the guise of being utopian. Dystopian literature has underlying cautionary tones, warning society that if we continue to live how we do, this will be the consequence. A dystopia, thus, is regarded as a sort of negative utopia and is often characterized by an authoritarian or totalitarian form of government. Dystopias usually feature different kinds of repressive social control systems, a lack or total absence of individual freedoms and expressions and constant states of warfare or violence. Dystopias often explore the concept of humans abusing technology and how humans individually and collectively cope with technology that has evolved too quickly such as the car, the flamethrower or the microwave. A dystopian society is also often characterized by widespread poverty and brutal political controls such as a large military-like police.</description>

<description>noitaminA (ノイタミナ) – Animation written backwards – is a Fuji Television programming block, devoted to anime, broadcast each Thursday night from 00:45 to 1:15. It was launched with the intention of expanding the target audience beyond the typical young male demographic.
The timeslot was expanded from half an hour to a full hour in 2010, and now airs Thursday nights from 00:45 to 1:45.
noitaminA aired its first non-anime series in 2010, with the premiere of the live-action adaptation of Moyashimon. On April 15, 2010, Fuji TV and FUNimation announced an agreement that allows FUNimation to simulcast series from the noitaminA block in North America within an hour of their airing in Japan.</description>

<name>dark atmosphere</name>
<description>Usually metaphorical. Sometimes literal. At times both!
Typically this refers to the fact that the story is set in a grim, dog eat dog milieu — for example a decaying city.
Often the characters are just doing what they need to do to survive, with little or no expectation that their lives can be better. And often characters may feel they do not have any real choice in what they do.
And yes, occasionally the setting is actually dark — be it night or perpetually heavy cloudy sky and rain. It all adds to the oppressive, hopeless feeling of the show.
You probably will not feel uplifted or happy after watching this anime.</description>

<name>gore</name>
<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<description>Rebellion, uprising, or insurrection is a refusal of obedience or order. It may, therefore, be seen as encompassing a range of behaviors aimed at destroying or taking over the position of an established authority such as a government, governor, president, political leader, financial institution, or person in charge. On the one hand the forms of behaviour can include non-violent methods such as the (overlapping but not quite identical) phenomena of civil disobedience, civil resistance and nonviolent resistance. On the other hand it may encompass violent campaigns. Those who participate in rebellions, especially if they are armed rebellions, are known as "rebels".&#13;

<name>just as planned</name>
<description>A term usually used to describe a situation, where a seemingly smart and cunning villain sets up a plan that seems grand and impressive, but is actually long winding, ridiculous, and convoluted. And all of that just to trick his opponent(s), like the hero or anybody else, into doing things exactly as he planned. Suffice to say that the villain could have reached his goal by much shorter and easier means, it just wouldn`t seem as awesome anymore.
The phrase is also known as the original Japanese "keikaku doori" where keikaku stands translated for "plan" or "schedule", and doori for "in accordance with ..." or "following ...".
The phrase is a reference to http://anidb.net/ch301 [Yagami Light] from http://anidb.net/a4563 [Death Note], and his love for plans.</description>

<description>Ginoza Nobuchika is an Enforcer with http://anidb.net/ch76608 [Public Safety Division 1] at the http://anidb.net/ch76607 [Public Safety Bureau].
He was demoted to Enforcer after his Crime Coefficient rose above regulation levels to 140, after the death of his father http://anidb.net/ch48543 [Masaoka Tomomi] at the hands of http://anidb.net/ch48756 [Makishima Shougo]. As part of the incident, Ginoza lost his left arm and gained a prosthetic, much like his father. Ginoza`s personality and outlook on life also drastically changed. Further, he no longer wears glasses; when http://anidb.net/ch48307 [Tsunemori Akane] asks if he actually needed prescription glasses, Ginoza replied that he wore glasses as he did not like the shape of his face, but he no longer cares about this aspect of his appearance.</description>
